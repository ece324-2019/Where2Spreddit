"tifupdate by finding out i've been accidentally dating and fucking my half-sister, after taking a 23andme dna test update. link to my previous post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/af5h58/tifu_by_finding_out_ive_been_accidentally_dating/

same updated posted here(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am8cr1/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) on r/23andme.

first things first, just wow. i can't thank you all enough for the support through the kind comments and messages. i wish i could reply to all of them, but there are just too many. 

i'll answer some common questions i received towards the end of the post, but i'll first start with where we left off. 

after a long dreadful night full of surprises, i woke up the next morning questioning everything. i called bullshit on the test and immediately called sarah. she picks up telling me she's already booked an appointment with a genetic counselor. good, we're both on the same page.  

the next day, we meet with the genetic counselor specifying in patients who take tests with commercial companies. tldr of what she said was, while the ancestry reports can be interpreted with a degree of skepticism, dna matches are determined directly through the raw dna data, meaning the connection is either there or it isn't. we asked if there was a possibility that we contaminated each other's samples. she said that our samples would have been flagged by the system (apparently that's easy to spot). even if our 'contaminated' samples magically made it through the system, we would have been shown to be sharing completely identical segments, while 23andme showed we only share half identical segments. 

it was basically confirmed by a specialist at this point and the same feeling of dread i had the other night began to set in again. my friend called an hour later, telling sarah and i to upload our raw data to a 3rd party dna site online, as extra confirmation. we did just that, and surprise surprise, we're shown as being half-siblings.

sarah and i spent the rest of the day calling both of our parents and explaining everything. we all came to the conclusion of sarah and i taking a weekend trip back home, to see how this all started. this idea came to me the same night when the whole ordeal began. 

ever since that night, sarah and i, understandably, haven't been the same. i've been trying to mentally cope with my emotions. the logic part of me is telling me ""incest bad, not right, break up"" while emotionally, i still love sarah. i'm having this constant battle in my head, and i'm sure sarah is too. all of this was especially apparent when friday rolled around. we both packed our bags and hopped into my car. during our entire drive up north towards home, not a single fucking word from the both of us. 5 hours later, we finally made it to sarah's house (the agreed meeting destination). right before we exit the car, my brain decides to short-circuit. i grab sarah's hand and lean into kiss her. she stops me, looks me in the eyes, and after brief pause while teary-eyed says ""no matter what the outcome of all this will be, i'll be leaving having gained a brother."" that shit hit me hard. we both hug each other and start crying. for the first time in nearly a week, i felt some kind of relief while simultaneously thinking ""wtf is going on"". sarah and i both being the emotional meat bags we are, stop hugging and head inside before one of us mentally breaks down (again). 

2 hours later my parents arrive, and we all sit down and formally meet for the first time. oh yeah, did i forget to mention how this is the first time both my parents and i are meeting sarah's family? imagine how fucking awkward that shit is. i'll spare you all the cringeful details of all of us trying to make the whole situation a 'normal conversation'. 

both of our mother's brought the sperm donor ids. for those of you who don't know what that is, when a woman has received a sperm donor sample from a cryo-bank, it comes with a id that is unique to that specific donor. our mother's compare the ids and... they're a match. sarah and i were conceived from the same donor (which we had already guessed to be the case).

the rest of the night was spent discussing what to do going on. as much as i still had feelings for her, sarah and i came to the conclusion of breaking up. we decided to go to a bi-weekly counseling therapist, to help us get past all this crap and transition into a sibling relationship. 

we spent the rest of our weekend catching up with our families and headed back to uni on monday. 

as of now, 12 days later, sarah and i are going to therapy together and we've maintained a friendly relationship, still keeping in touch throughout the week. mentally, we're both much better but still have a long way to go. it's to early to tell, but i have hope for the future.

q&a:

q: when were you both conceived?

a: we were both conceived a month apart, and born 5 weeks apart.


q: do you guys look alike?

a: no, not really. the only thing we 'have in common' are our somewhat similar noses. 


q: what were your ancestry results?

a: idk why this was a really common question i got through pm, but here you go(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am85w9/my_results/)


q: what town are you both from?

a: no


q: why do you both care? you should stay together.

a: there's no way that's happening in this society, nor do i want it to happen. we'd have to deal with social and even legal problems (depending on the state). also, we'd run the risk of conceiving a genetically unhealthy child if we chose to have kids. 


q: were you two able to find your biological father?

a: sarah and i didn't match closely (in terms of 1st cousins and up) with anyone else on 23andme, and as of now, we no longer have a desire to find our bio-father. the genetic counselor mentioned we should keep an eye out for any future half-siblings taking the test.

tldr: confirmed incest with specialist, went back home with ex-gf/half-sister, moms confirmed the same sperm sample. sarah and i have maintained a 'sibling-like' relationship and are currently in therapy.

"my(18m) gf(18f) always initiates sex and then stops just before we start, is it fair of me to ask her not to initiate at all?. she'll usually start making out with me and grinding on me and stuff, and then she'll kind of pull away and stop to do just lie down instead. she's said she knows she initiates it and says she just changes her mind just before we start every time. that's fine, i don't want to pressure her into absolutely anything, but after it happened consecutively for a few days i stopped her and said ""listen, you don't want to do anything and that's fine, but please stop initiating stuff. it's not a nice feeling when it stops just before. that doesn't mean force yourself to do anything, just if you're unsure about doing anything, don't start at all.""

edit: she is not manipulative. our communication is great, whenever there's an issue we just say ""hey, we good? anything we need to talk about??""

also, we do hands stuff, but we're **both** not okay with going down on one another.

and she's said she's okay with sex for those concerned about 'maybe shes not okay with it' etc

edit 2: i'm not really super duper fussed about it. the rest of our relationship is great, i just wanted to know if it seems okay to say something like that. ill talk to her about it sometime if it really becomes a hurdle in the relationship but we're very healthy! it's all great, really :) thank you all for the concern!! love you all! this gained so much traction it's nerve wracking!!!!",7
"retailers taking advantage of the ""buy in bulk to save"" assumption of shoppers. ever buy in bulk to save on the per unit cost? the battle to get your money's worth used to only be whether you would use all of the bulk items you bought. beware, i've noticed amazon sellers taking advantage of this assumption and charging more for bulk buying.

i don't know if they prices will show up the same for everyone, but as an example 1 qt of oil is $6.47. a 5 qt jug is $7.69 per qt. a 3 pack of 5 qt jugs is 8.02 per qt. a 6 pack of 1 qt jugs is $9.85 per qt.

i've noticed this tactic at local grocery stores too. be sure to calculate the per unit cost when buying anything these days, folks.

edit: sorry about the notifications, no idea why it happened. many people i talked to irl were shocked when i told them about this, so i thought i'd share for the people who don't know that paying more for bulk is becoming a common practice.

"my girlfriend found a company that helps people who are financially struggling, but i fear they're scamming us. my girlfriend found a lady who claimed she works for a company called the young america mutual insurance company, and their whole shtick is they take insurance deposits of people that have passed away, and donate those to the younger people of america who are struggling with debt and making ends meet. the person at the company told her that she would transfer money to our account, my girlfriend would then transfer back about 70% of it, and the other 30% would be ours to keep.

she needed to know our bank acct info before doing the transfer, so we emptied out the account just to be safe, and did the double transfer like she said. and then we did it the next day. and the whole time this is going on she is keeping in *constant* communication. like messaging everyday constantly, just to make sure everything is going perfectly.

my girlfriend is now getting just as skeptical as i am, because the woman told us to withdraw the money and send snaps of it to her. we withdrew as much as the atm would allow, but just want to sit on it for awhile, because we know people have gotten in trouble for spending money that isn't theirs. is this money ours, or are we getting scammed or used as a way to launder money or something?",10
"update - washington state: neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. what can i do?. previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5r4lco/washington_state_neighbor_is_currently_video/)

so a ton has happened since i last posted. i had mentioned in the comments that my neighbor had been basically using sound terrorism to harass us. i began a writing in a log of each event that occurred, with the time, the date, the description, if i called the police (i did for almost every one), and it began to show an alarming pattern—he was playing sounds at random times of the night every single night. after each major event of sounds, i would drop off a written statement to my local police station for the code enforcement officer. the city was now looking at charging him for noise violations based on my complaints.

i took my three page log and copies of seven signed statements and finally had enough of the police taking their time to work on the case against my neighbor. i dropped $95 on paperwork to begin an anti-harassment order against my neighbor. i made sure to explicitly mention the camera pointed in my bedroom window and the ongoing noises.

he was served the temporary order that very day by the local police, and sure enough, the noises ramped up. before our court date to discuss the anti-harassment order, we were subpoenaed to be witnesses for the noise violation. we also brought the former owner of the home as well as the person who lived on the other side of my neighbor as witnesses to his noise-making capabilities. my neighbor never showed to the court date, and at that point had $1,250 pending in tickets. his lawyer showed up an hour late and the judge graciously accepted his plea to move the date a month forward. disappointment.

then the date for the anti-harassment order came. once again, my neighbor didn't show and his lawyer begged for more time to look over the case. the judge was just and said that everyone has a right to defend their first amendment rights, so he moved the court date for a month later as well. disappointment number two.

the noises are continuing on the regular at this point and we are trying to record them as best as we can on our phones. it was really hard to do because the noises were short, and happened at random in the middle of the night.

the date for the second anti-harassment hearing arrived and finally, we saw our neighbor come through the courtroom and sit in the back. when it was our turn to explain the situation, we made sure to present our call log, our statements, and videos that we had as evidence against our neighbor. our neighbor's lawyer tried to get us to give up the call log because he mentioned he was not aware of it before our court date. the judge basically told the lawyer to go fuck himself. the lawyer's only defense for my neighbor was that he worked long hours and couldn't possibly be awake in the middle of the night to terrorize us, and that conversely, we were the ones making the noises. we then brought up the fact that our neighbor had a security camera pointed directly at our home, and he should have plenty of evidence to prove we were indeed the noisemakers. the judge very confidently approved our anti-harassment order stating no more noises, no more cameras in our windows or at us in general, and our neighbor is not allowed within 25 feet of us. he immediately moved the camera pointing in our bedroom window to being completely flush with the side of the house. awesome!

this was great news. we finally achieved some peace! and then the date for the noise violation trial came. just his lawyer showed up, and made a deal with the city lawyer that one ticket would be paid, in exchange for no appeal to our anti-harassment order and to throw out two tickets. it sucked, but they took the deal. whatever.

and all seemed well.

then, about a month after the anti-harassment order kicked in, the noises began, again. and the camera began to slowly point into our garage, back in the direction toward the bedroom window.

this time, the police noticed something more alarming.

a red light was going off in the tinted window directly below the camera on the outside of my neighbor's house. they shone their flashlight and spotted a lens. my neighbor had a camera inside his window pointed at my bedroom window the entire time the order was in place, and long before that.

the officers told us to stay quiet, don't be alarmed, but they now were actively seeking a search warrant for the property to seize any noise making equipment and to take down the cameras, as he had broken the order.

the next weekend, my neighbor was arrested and we got to sit outside on the front porch while they disassembled the cameras and seized speaker after speaker, megaphones, etc. from my neighbor's home. they said he had four foot of insulation surrounding the room with the camera, and the front door of the home was completely barred shut.

unfortunately, they just seized the equipment and will eventually give it back. my neighbor was out of jail the next day, and since they didn't have a search warrant for his hard drives, they couldn't place any voyeurism charges, despite my insistence. they even mentioned they saw me and my husband on a laptop of his.

i'm just happy that the noises have stopped and as far as i know, no more hidden cameras. i'm just glad i could update this crazy situation for you guys. i'm sure i'm not out of the woods yet.

tl;dr: got an anti-harassment order and cameras were supposed to come down, neighbor was a creep and had a hidden camera for a month while the order was in place, probably longer. he got arrested and no more cameras.",2

"(nv) brother-in-law was attacked 2 nights ago, shot several times, exchanged gunfire with the attacker. police took his wallet with $1,500 in it, and have made a suspicious call to hospital.. short backstory, my brother-in-law was ambushed outside of his home after being dropped off be a female coworker. the initial story is that her ex-boyfriend had followed them home and attacked my bil when he got out of the car. my bil returned fire and hit him, and they're both in the hospital. there are a lot of stories flying around between everyone, it's not clear yet what the whole truth is. aside from that, i have two more practical immediate concerns.



the call that the police made to the hospital was requesting his medical file number. the nurses didn't disclose any information to the officer that called because my bil was admitted into the trauma ward without his name being registered. following that, the officer then called my mil for the number, and told her it was so that he could see what the blood tests said. 


my wife told her mom to make sure it was all on the up and up before returning the call, and the nurses overheard and told my mil to provide a recently assigned social workers number to the police, and tell them to handle whether or not the police have access to that information.


sorry, i know that's long without a question, but i guess what i want to know is, is this actually a concerning event? does this smell wrong? my brother in law doesn't have the best criminal history, but he's done a lot of work to expunge his records, and the gun he used to defend himself is legally his. the details are still pretty coming out, i understand why the police are investigating things, but there is a real concern that they are looking for something to besmirch his character. it feels like they want to find out if he had drugs in his system, and i just don't think that's appropriate for them to be looking at without a warrant.


also what we can do to try to make sure he gets his money back? he had just cashed his paycheck and i've heard way too many stories about people losing their property to civil forfeiture.can we demand some sort of itemization of things that they have seized from him as evidence? what can be done to ensure he gets his things back?





edit: we are gonna meet a lawyer in a few hours for some advice and hopefully help. thank you all for your comments and advice. i appreciate it greatly.",2

"by hating the person in front of me at the drive-thru. this morning, i woke up on the wrong side of the bed, mainly due to lack of sleep. i decided to go to starbucks for some caffeine to help offset the long day ahead of me, as you do. at a traffic light really close to the drive-thru, i was right behind a large suv sitting in the rightmost lane. i wanted to turn right, and they did not—i couldn't turn, but no biggie. after a long wait, light turns green, and they decide to turn right spontaneously. i was annoyed, but whatever. (no signs say you can't turn right on red.)

they turn into the starbucks drive-thru, blocking me from going and making it so that i'd have to partially block the small road leading into the strip mall or circle around. i had to be somewhere soon, so i took my chances. they didn't pull in all the way, so i stuck out in the small street, annoyed. luckily no one came behind me.

i guess i was in an extra bitchy mood today, but i just started hating this lady and her stupid massive suv and the little chihuahua hanging out her car window and the stupid tv's playing cartoons in the car and the 6 frappucinos they had to hand her. i thought, ""i bet she's one of those super shallow people who lives for the rat race."" i pulled up to the window to get my drink, wanting this clearly shallow-ass lady to leave already.

once i pulled up, they smiled, handed me my drink and said, ""the person in front of you paid for your order already.""

i had never felt so forcefully slapped by the universe before. i could practically hear the words ""shut the fuck up"" ringing in my dumb little brain. immediately my day got 100 times better and easier.

faith in humanity restored, and i hope whoever i was so horrifically judging had a wonderful rest of their day.

tl;dr i spent 10 minutes hating and judging the person in front of me, only to find out that they paid for my drink. made my day, and also changed my life lol

"about to end my engagement/five year relationship. i am about to end my engagement.  i started to seriously doubt things months ago when, after a fight, my fiance said that he was glad we worked things out because i made him so mad that he wanted to choke me.  since then, i've tried to bring up the statement several times because i felt that it was a threat and extremely hurtful.  during that same fight, he called me a moron because i told him i didn't understand why this specific issue was making him so upset.  every time i try to have a conversation about it, he says i needed to hear that to know how angry he was.  the fight was about how our dog may think that i'm more dominant than he is because of something i did while playing with the pup.

&#x200b;

a few weeks ago, my fiance called me and berated me because the car that i bought him has some issues.  nothing major i think; it probably just needs a tire balance and the bumper fixed.  he had been calling me and berating me about it ever since i bought it for him.  i thought it was a nice car, i just wanted him to have reliable transportation since he worked far away and it put a lot of strain on our finances and relationship.  he demanded an apology for me buying him the car, but when i hesitated he hung up.  he made me so angry, that i sent him a series of nasty texts.  they were true, but i could have been more tactful.  however, i went home halfway through class to do damage control and apologize.

&#x200b;

when i got home, we started to talk.  he told me the things i said were hurtful, and i apologized.  i didn't say much and just tried to listen.  i did the best i could to validate him physically and verbally, but when it was my turn to speak, i told him that he's also said some really hateful things to me (i.e. the choking comment) and never apologized.  i kept it vague, but i confessed it was about him insinuating violence toward after he asked for clarification.  i know it wasn't right to bring up something from the past in a current argument, but it was months ago and i just couldn't stop thinking about it.  when i mentioned that comment, he immediately became enraged.  he covered his ears and started screaming that he was done with the conversation.  i never even got to say all that much.  he started screaming at me to leave, but i stood my ground (i have a dog and a cat and didn't want to leave them with him).  then, he flipped our bed and broke the frame.  he picked up the frame and tossed it up against the ceiling so that the light fixture from the fan shattered.  he destroyed our room.  i suddenly became clear headed, and called the police.

&#x200b;

he was arrested on simple assault.  he sat in jail for about 48 hours, until his brother bailed him out.  he's home now, and things seem superficially fine.  i tentatively tried to have a conversation about going to couples counseling, but he got angry.  he insisted that he did not want a 3rd person in our relationship, and told me that if i was too afraid to talk to him about our issues outside of a counseling office, then we don't need to be together.  any time he thinks that i'm afraid of him, or notices that i'm walking on eggshells when talking to him, he gets really volatile.  i do recall asking him to come to pre-marital counseling and/or couples therapy a few times before.  i've flat out told him that i don't mind him having emotions, but i don't like the way he expresses them, and his response is that it's censorship and that if i can't handle him being angry, then i need to leave.  i've left out a lot of other issues with our relationship to prevent this post from becoming too tedious, but there are many.

&#x200b;

i know that i have to leave him, but we have spent five years together and it's so hard.

&#x200b;

if anybody has any advice, encouragement, or even kind words, i am in desperate need now.

update: a lot of you have mentioned/asked about me seeing a therapist for 1v1 sessions, and i have been for at least 10 years.  she is helping me with all of this, too.  also, i picked the car, and he went and looked at it with me.  i advised him that we should take it somewhere to get looked at, or keep looking, but he insisted on that one.  the issues are very minor and probably won't cost more than 300$ to fix overall.",7

edit 2: yea the obvious thing is to not answer numbers you don't know or to hang up immediately. the point is if you find yourself in this situation, answering safely won't be your first instinct. maybe now it will be.

edit 3: for anyone wondering, the responses largely breakdown into a few categories:

1. don't answer the phone/just hang up.
2. i don't need security i have guns/dogs.
3. tell them to come so you can use your security/guns/dogs.
4. yes this actually happened to me/someone i know/this is useful.
5. this would never happen/is not useful.

it's that 4th category that makes it all worth it! i appreciate your stories. not trying to paranoid, just trying to help :)",8
"my dad (52m) has been inappropriate with me (18f).. i live with my mom, dad and a younger sister. my dad is usually home for 5 months during which he has a break before taking up projects the rest of the year. 

 i turned 18 last year, he's been at home for 2 months now. i have a room of my own, my sister chooses to sleep with me at times and sometimes with my parents. i usually sleep without locking my door. about a month and a half ago, my dad enters my room at around 2 am in the morning, waking me up asking for sexual favors. i'm usually a deep sleeper and this woke me right up, was traumatizing - i immediately screamed at him, asking him to go away from my room locking the door in the process. i couldn't sleep the entire night, the morning was only worse - though i never feared going to the table for breakfast, he behaved as though everything was normal. my mom only knows there was an issue back then, but doesn't know the details. 

&#x200b;

i have been locking my door ever since that day. over the course of 2 months, this has repeated 3 times now - having him knock the door, waking me up. i only opened it the first time, asking him never to do it again nor enter my room. the other times, i only was left wide awake and never did open the door. i never could sleep properly ever since and always check under the door to see who it is.

&#x200b;

early this morning, my sister had an event to attend to and she woke up early, knocked the door. after confirming it was her (half asleep), i let her in in order for her to take her clothes and leave with mom. my sleep cycles are bad, my health isn't in good shape though i do try my best to keep fit. i fall asleep, without the door locked. i'm woken up by dad - touching me inappropriately, forcing me down and asking me to co-operate. i used to exercise earlier and am quite strong physically so i could forcibly get myself away. i was trembling, my mind unable to process anything - all i could do was to scream at him and lock the door behind him. 

&#x200b;

he crossed a line i was hoping i could prevent and i feel rotten inside. i can't seem to get it out of my head. my dad has always served to be an inspiration for me - i always used to look up to him and this ruins a lot of things for me. i feel helpless. i never got to spend much time with dad and wasn't closer to mom than i was with him because of the time he spent away. i used to look forward to time with him and now i just wish he were gone. 

&#x200b;

distance never really helped with our relationship with dad. mom and dad were on the verge of splitting up for the same.  but he means the world to her. no one else including us sisters could ever giver her anything like how she enjoys her time with him. he makes her the happiest and how she treasures him is special. she hasn't been working for quite some time now. the sole source of income is from dad. 

it would be selfish of me to break it to mom. it would break her and i don't wish for that to happen. dad being the only source of income would mean if i ever broke it to mom and they decided to split - my sister's (13) education would be at a stake and we could never be able to live the way we do. i have friends, cousins i know i can rely on - (though none of them know) but mom's usually at home and fin's comfort only with dad. i find myself cornered, and can't really seem to find hope in anything. i feel broken and devastated. my true sense of inspiration is destroyed. 

things could probably never be the same again. i just hope there's a way out - one in which neither mom nor my sister would have to face the brunt because of me. i have thought it over, and i don't think it would get better wrt dad until i could do something about it - however selfish it may be.  the only way out is i see is to wait until the end of three more months. i'm halfway there perhaps. 

apologies for the long post. writing with this state of mind is hard but i needed to get it off of my chest and seek help.",7
"- my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch. on thursday evenings my daughter (9f) goes to dance class with her friend anna (9f). my wife told me to pick my daughter and anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

i pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. my daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and i ask anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. we all order and start eating, when suddenly anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. i ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and i look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

i rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. i felt horrible. i call my wife when anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and i do not have anna's mother's phone number. so after anna is given the all clear i immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

her mother is furious, saying that i could have killed her child. i said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would i assume something like that. she responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. she also said that she didn't know i would be getting them dinner (school ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so i thought it would be safe to assume i would be giving them food..) i apologized for what happened, but still feel like anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

"by sending my son to school in his pajamas because i had misread ""pi day"" as ""pj day"" in a school email.. let's start off by saying i'm a single dad and my son is in kindergarten. his teacher sent out a message yesterday that said ""tomorrow for pi day we have a parent bringing in a snack."" i had only glanced at it. ten minutes later, i got a message from my son's mom asking if i have a matching set of pjs for him to wear. i replied yes, and then never looked at the teacher's email again.  

fast forward to this morning, and i dress my boy in his favorite pjs and take him to school. as i approach, i notice that no one else is wearing pjs and my son is trotting around in bright red spider man pajama pants. so i get him to the door of the school, send him in, and immediately pull my phone out to look at the email. i had to read it twice before i noticed that it didn't say ""pj day"" at all, but fucking ""pi day!"" 

so i sent an email to his teacher explaining the mix up and asked her to make him feel comfortable today. she said she glossed it over with the other kids and made it a non issue. luckily, they are only 5-year-olds in kindergarten with little self awareness. 

so sorry, son! here's a little lesson on being different!!

tl;dr - sent my son to school in his pajamas because i had misread ""pi day"" as ""pj day"" in a school email. his teacher made it a non issue in class and it didn't scar my son for life, hopefully. 



update: his mom picked him up and said that he immediately asked to call me to let me know that today was not pajama day.  he said that his teacher let him slide because he had enough classroom points, but he knows that it wasn't pj day. lol. his mom took part of the blame. thank goodness he's so young. this would not have worked out as well in first or second grade. 

edit: wow! my first gold and silver. thanks everyone!! i'm glad you enjoyed my story. 

edit 2: sorry for my choice of wording. but let me clarify that there wasn't any blame or consequence by the teacher.  i was self blaming, if anything. the teacher just used the classroom points as a hollow excuse to lighten any ridicule or confrontation from the other kids. i think she was just trying to bring it forward in a positive light and then get past it and move on. no blame or consequence. just the teacher spreading sugar and me feeling like an ass.

"(from an american point of view) we are running out of real problems, so we make up stuff to be mad about.. from my own personal experience, i feel like society is really trying hard to find things to be upset about.

i'm sure everyone has their own experiences, but here's a little background on me.... i was born in the us, but my parents are immigrants from the middle east.  i was born into the opposite of wealth, debt.  we didn't have much growing up.  both my parents busted their ass, making a life for myself and my siblings.  i grew up in chicago.  we didn't come from any money, and my parents were not educated.  they learned how to speak english, and just went from there.  my dad worked as an appliance repair man, and my mom worked in retail.  we had little to nothing, but they did their best insulating us from the always impending financial ruin we were on the brink of.  my siblings and i picked up on that, but we didn't want to add stress to them and played dumb.  they kept working hard, saving, and tried to instill in us the value of hard work and integrity, and that some day good will come of it.  at the end of the day, we (the kids) all turned out great.  we all own homes in good neighborhoods, have money saved up, and have decent work.... most importantly we lead our lives with honesty and integrity.

so i feel like my family started from the bottom, and through sheer dedication we all made it.  while this was tough, it was not as tough as life is where they came from.  especially today as we are iraqi christians (but that's a whole other story).

i'm 32.  i've got a great job (even though i never finished college, couldn't afford to keep going, and my ethnic background didn't get me anything in terms of scholarships or financial aid like some of my friends), i finally own a home, have no debt other than my mortgage, i've got a bit saved up for a rainy day, and a pretty decent amount in my 401k for someone my age.  all of my accomplishments, and my family's have been through discipline and sacrifice.  i didn't buy the nice car, i bought the used honda.  i didn't buy the fancy clothes, i went to discount stores.  i didn't eat out, i cooked every night.  i lived well within my means.

to my point.  i really feel like a lot of what people are angry about, fighting over, or are offended by, is complete bullshit.  why have people gotten so soft?  every time i turn on the news, talk to friends or people at the office, there's a new artificial outrage that's sweeping across the country.  are there people still struggling with poverty, addiction, abuse, etc? absolutely.  but i think those yelling and complaining the most are coming from some kind of privilege, or they can change their path but refuse to so they can remain a victim.

is it just me or are things actually kind of ok and not that bad?  i just think the whining and yelling (especially from my generation) is unwarranted.  if that energy was applied to bettering themselves, they may discover there is upward mobility here in the us.  is it evenly distributed? no, but life isn't fair.",6
"for having fun in front of miserable people?. my husband and i rent a house with his brother and wife. we live in a very expensive city and this is quite a big house with great metro access, so that's what's convenient. we get along fine usually.


my husband and i have a son. he's just turned five. the early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! during this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. there were quite some bad days, but my husband and i got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. so a few days ago, i pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. when we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. it seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. i sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.then my son and i leave for the movie.


today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that i didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. i'm kind of shocked that i'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. i feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

aita?

eta: for all those asking if i resent my in laws for not helping... i think any parent would like help. but i don't feel entitled to their help when it's my husband's and my decision to have said child. however i am feeling really resentful right now that they feel entitled to my help and the fact that they never helped me definitely makes it worse.",3

"i22m like the girl19f, but should i ask her if she's left something in her vagina?. so i started seeing this girl a little while ago and we moved things to the bedroom relatively quickly. we didn't do anything the first time we hung out as she was on her period, but the second time was a bit more active.

we'd gone back to her place and while i was laying down some finger work i swear i could feel something inside of her. weird thought, i know, but it felt a bit cramped and like something artificial was there. there was a bit of an odor too, but i'd initially just put that down to iffy higene or something. so i was second guessing myself trying to work out if i'd imagined something inside this girls vagina. part of me is saying it's ridiculous, but the other part is running through possibilities. what if its a tampon or something that's just been forgotten? 

the kicker is this girl says she's never masturbated, so i really don't know how often she'd get the chance to check. 

i feel paranoid and a little immature worrying about this, but i can't help but fret. do i ask/tell her about it? ignore it? i want to keep seeing this girl, but i have no idea how to even approach this issue. 

any advice?

"i just found found out my husband (32m) cheated on me (27f) at his bachelor party. using throwaway account. we are newlyweds been married less than a month. we lived together for 3 years before we got married and we dated for 4 years before he proposed. i've never had trust issues with him before, we even did long distance for a year when he had to travel for work and it worked out great. 

for his bachelor party half of his groomsmen were also engaged so they had a big blowout bachelor party trip in mexico. i was weary of letting him  go because i know his single friends party hard, they travel just to party with hookers and strippers on yachts. i've heard all their wild party stories. but he assured me there's no way anything will happen because there was only 2 single guys on the trip and none of his friends have ever cheated before. i'm not an insecure person because i'm confident young and attractive so i let him go. even though there would have been a lot of temptation to cheat i trusted him. 

when he came back from his trip i asked him if anything happened, he said no everyone behaved, especially him! i asked his best man if he had anything to tell me before we tied the knot and he said my fiancee adores me and would never cheat on me. we got married as planned. fast forward to today, a month after we got married. he left his phone on the couch where we were sitting, he left the room to take a shower. his phone is lighting up with texts from his best friend. talking about the bachelor party. they wanted to go back to the same country that the bachelor party was at for his friend's birthday and were talking about a girl. 

i know his phone password so i opened up his phone and read all the text messages with his friend. basically his scumbag best friend was bragging to my fiancee that he covered for him so well there's no way i'll ever find out about him cheating before our wedding. my fiancee thanked him and said that the bachelors need to go over their stories so that they all match. i found videos of my husbands friends cheating getting oral from hookers on a yacht. i found photos of my husband kissing a girl on his lap in a bikini which i'm guessing is the one of the prostitutes he was using on his trip. basically every single guy on the trip had sex with prostitutes which means now not only is my marriage affected but i don't know if it's my responsibility to break 3 women's hearts whose husbands or fiancees were also on the bachelor trip. the things i found is going to break up the homes of all his closest friends and i don't even know if i should tell them or not. i screenshotted everything and sent it to myself. 

i don't know what to do because i don't want our marriage to end over this. honestly i was willing to instantly forgive him if he owned up and apologized immediately after he came home. but the fact that he lied upsets me more than the cheating, is that weird? i don't know if he feels any guilt. i am especially seeking advice from people who stayed in a relationship after discovering infidelity. is it possible to heal something like this or are we doomed for divorce? this is the first time i've ever been cheated on ever and i don't why i feel like i should be angry but i'm not - is there something wrong with me?",7

"by taking my bird for a walk and accidentally looking like a pedophile. my husband and i adopted my parent's parrot this spring after my dad passed away and my mom moved into assisted living. we got a backpack carrier for him last month so we can visit and my mom can still see him (the parrot, not my dad).

since we have the backpack, we decided to take him for nature walks instead of always keeping him in the house. for now we're putting the backpack in a baby stroller so it's less of a jarring bumpy ride until he gets used to standing on a moving perch. it's got screen mesh on three sides so he can see out, but it's a little hard to see into his pack from more than a foot or two away. it just looks like we're pushing a stroller with a large backpack in it.

so yesterday we went on our first walk in a local park. the bird's quiet, or calmly chirping, or occasionally saying ""hello, youuuuuuu"" and we respond back in kind, a call and response thing he likes.

the park's mostly deserted - until the local high school track team runs by for their after-school practice run through the park. a bunch of teenage boys, shirtless. and one lags behind. as the lone boy, maybe 15 years old, runs past us, the bird calls out the loudest wolf whistle ever. and my husband and i burst out laughing, as the boy runs away from us faster.

yesterday i went for a walk in the woods at dodge park when members of what i believe were your track team went running by me. one of the team members was lagging behind, and i inappropriately chose that moment to let out the loudest wolf whistle possible.

at the time i was sitting in my backpack carrier in a stroller, being pushed by my owners. they broke out in loud laughter. the person i whistled at probably didn't see me and thought my owners whistled at me to sexually harass me, and then were laughing loudly about it because they were jerks. that's not what happened, and while they didn't need to laugh, the whole incident was entirely my fault. i was acting inappropriately.

sincerely,

bongo, a poorly behaved parrot who needs to learn boundaries.

"by showing my friend nude pictures of his sister. this happened almost 4 years ago, but today it made me think about it.

backstory, i met this amazing girl at a party that some friends of mine were throwing.  it was a themed party, prep boy and school girls, and she was as kind as she was sexy.  we exchange numbers and proceed to texting and talking on the phone and went out on a few dates.

well, just like most relationships, i assume, she sent me a few sexy pictures of herself.  well one day, my buddy asks me about the girl i am dating.  i tell him about her and he asks about her body.  i show him a picture she took of herself laying out by the pool, neck down.  he grabs my phone and starts swiping.  before i can stop him he freaks out yelling ""that is my fucking sister!!!"" i then realize the picture he was looking at was one i took of her fully nude.  after that, he was not too happy about it, or me dating his sister.

but this story has a happy ending.  the reason i am posting this today, is because this is the one year anniversary of the day i married that wonderful woman, and that buddy was one of my groomsman.

and before anyone asks, no, she has no clue her brother saw a picture of her nude, i think she would be mortified if she did.

tl;dr: was dating a girl who turned out to be my buddy's sister, showed him a nude photo of her and he freaked out.

edit: since people are freaking out thinking i showed a nude picture on purpose let me clarify.  i showed my friend a picture of her in a bikini neck down that she took laying out by a pool.  she posted said picture on instagram as well as sent it to me.  i did not willingly violate her trust by showing him a nude picture of her.  apologies if my wording was off.

edit 2: thank you for the gold and silver, you guys are awesome!  also, since everyone asks how i didn't know she was my buddy's sister.  she and him have a common last name like smith.  and i did not know his sisters name.  when i told him i was dating a girl named ""jill"" (not her name) he didn't immediately think ""oh hey is that my sister."" because it is a common name.  and as for my wife, we had been dating for a little over a month.  when she said she had a brother, i didn't go ""oh what's his name, where does he work, what's his astrological sign.""  because i wanted to know her first, know her likes and hobbies.  i guess i could have dove more into questions about her family, but we weren't at the point of meeting each other's parents yet.  hope this helps with those questions, if it does not. sorry.  again thank you for all the kind words and happy anniversary comments.  you people are amazing!",4
"i 34m was told last month i was getting a 15% raise on my salary 47.5k; got my first paycheck today and my net pay only increased by $150. where'd my raise go?. the company i work for told me last month i was approved for a 15% raise; that seemed like a lot but i have been really busting my ass this year to prove my worth (in preparation for asking for said raise) and felt pretty accomplished when i got the good news. by my calculations it would but my gross pay right around $54k, which for the field i work in is not too bad for a non-management position. my calculations told me i'd see an increase in my after-tax pay of about $400, which i was planning on throwing at my debt and car payment to expedite clearing them out.

to my surprise, i checked my paystub this morning and my net pay only increased by $150. my gross pay seems to check out re: the increase i was told i was getting, but it seems like most of it has been swallowed up by taxes (over $1.1k this month alone). at the end of the day, my annual take home pay is only increasing ~$2k, off a raise that boosted my annual gross over $7k. so here's my question: am i getting over-deducted in my taxes, or is this what the news means when they talk about the death of the middle class? 

addendum 1: i am paid monthly.

addendum 2: per recommendations from the comments, i went back and pulled my last pre-raise paystub to compare withholdings. my previous gross pay was $3,900 and my federal withholdings were $377/month; adding in social security and medicare + my $60 in health care deductions, my total deductions pre-raise were ~$730. post-raise: my gross pay is $4,552, medicare and social security withholdings only raised a little bit, but my federal tax jumped up to $763/month, over double what it was last month and is the bulk of why my total deductions were over $1.1k. i'm gonna check with hr and see if that's where it's supposed to be.

addendum 3: talked with hr, they confirmed there was a mistake with the paystub service/program they use in the federal withholding calculations this month; they've fixed the glitch and are crediting me back the difference. so, raise found! thanks for everyone's thoughtful replies.",10
"austin, tx apartment maintenance workers walked in unannounced on my naked girlfriend, just moments after watching me leave for class, then take their time leaving. they've been watching her for months.. the maintenance workers in our apartment complex have always lingered outside our door since we moved in back in september of last year. we've had a few tickets put in for minor repairs on some appliances, and the first two times they came, they always knocked because the deadbolt was locked, even though they tried to enter without any prior notification. she noticed, as i'm usually oblivious to things of that nature, that they've been spying on her, like walking by frequently to try to see through her blinds, among other things such as minor cat calls. today, when i left for class, just about a minute after i closed the door, the maintenance people walked up and unlocked our door without knocking, then walked in on my naked girlfriend, who had just gotten out of the shower and thought i came home to get something i forgot. 

she feels like maybe it's her fault because she had a ticket in for repairs, but i feel like this is predatory behavior, and that no maintenance worker should legally be able to enter someone's home unannounced, and that the main office should send and email with an estimate on the time frame in which the repairs would take place.

""so i got up to put some deodorant on in the bathroom. the kind with the roller ball. i go to put it on and nothing is coming out. so i do a quick flick of it to get the liquid inside moving. worst case scenario the roller bar goes flying off and liquid deodorant goes flying everywhere. mirror, walls, floor... e v e r y w h e r e...

&#x200b;

even worse... the deodorant is the exact color and consistency of semen. the bathroom looked like 10 guys had an orgy. my pants are also covered with this substance. i cleaned it up the best i could but i am horrified at what people will think if i missed a spot (i debated about telling the attendant but i am 99% sure i got everything. the worst part is i didn't even get to use it.""

&#x200b;

tl;dr my husband tried to put deodorant while on his flight and instead made it look like he had a mile high sex party.",4

"if you've had the same internet service plan for a while, take a look at what your isp's current advertised plans are. you may be ""grandfathered in"" on a slower, more expensive plan.. realized this the other day, and i wish i had figured it out years ago. my family has been on the same internet + phone + cable package from knology (now wow) for over a decade. after fees and taxes, my dad was paying $270/mo for the whole package, and though i don't know the cable/phone details, i do know we were only getting 20 mbps down/2 mbps up internet speed. that didn't seem right to me, so i went and took alook.

on their website, this isp does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. they do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).

turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. so while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.

one call to the isp, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. we are now getting 1gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.

edit: for like the 50th time, i typed down when i meant to type up, and up when i meant to type down. my speed is 1g down, 50m up, not the other way around.

also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every isp** and in fact some isps will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers. wow seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes, but i can't speak for any other isp.",8
"i just realized i'm 1 year self-harm free and i'm so happy to be alive like never before.. it was august 27 the last time i did it, i remember it because my blood by twenty one pilots was released. yesterday i went to their show and listening to that song reminded me of that and it made me extremely proud of myself because i worked hard the whole year to feel better. one year later i'm safe and more than okay, life is going great and i'm still working on myself but it's not as hard as it used to be. 
i just wanted to say that it really gets better, it's not a fake phrase. you will get better. i promise you. i'm proud of you for keep going everyday. please if you can find support, go to therapy and if you can fight to make it become a free option for everybody in need.

"by detoxing myself and it nearly cost me my life. obligatory this happened 2 weeks ago

&#x200b;

i had been dieseling through a handle of cheap vodka every other day for over a year. i've never been much of a drinker, but several traumatic events had transpired in a very short amount of time, so i began drinking more to help me cope. i would never consider drinking during the day or before work, but it helped me get through the day. mixed drinks slowly gave way to straight shots of vodka. i would wake up at 7 am, feed the cat and take several shots. this continued well into the evening until i passed out on the couch or my bed. i started working at a local department store and the schedule was perfect as i didn't have to be in till1pm so i could wake up early, take several shots and sleep on the couch till noon then get ready for work; taking a couple of swigs on my way out the door. i'd get home around 10 pm and drink until i passed out.

this past february is when the shakes started, usually near the end of my shift. i'd get home, have a few shots and everything would be fine. what was disturbing was my memory loss. i was repeating stories, unsure of what day is was and i even forgot to pick up my nephew from school. dusk and dawn were the worst, it took me a few minutes to figure out if was day or night. i knew something had to change. two saturdays ago i bought a handle in the afternoon and it was gone by sunday evening. i woke up monday morning feeling awful. i was shaking, queasy and terribly off balance, but i didn't drink. by the afternoon i was feeling better and i figured i would get through this. i went to visit my sister and was having a glass of wine and a cigarette out on her back porch when i began to vomit all over her back deck. it was then that the shakes returned with a vengeance.

i went home and crashed on the couch. i woke up around 5 am and spent 20 minutes dry-heaving in the bathroom. i tried drinking water, but my hands were shaking so bad that it took both of them to steady the glass. i went back to the couch and drifted in and out of sleep for the majority of the morning. sometime after noon, i went to get my cat some water, but my hand began to convulse uncontrollably. i tried to steady it with my other hand, but i spilled water everywhere; that was the last thing i remembered. i was laying on my stomach on the living room floor when i noticed a police officer standing over me. i had no idea where i was or what had happened. i tried to get to my feet but collapsed onto the couch. my coffee table had been completely turned upside down and its contents were strewn all about the room. my mouth was in so much pain and i saw chunks of blood on the floor where i had been laying. the officer helped me get my shoes and coat on and assisted me out into the hall.

there were 2 more officers waiting outside and the helped me down the stairs to an ambulance. the paramedics were asking me questions, but i couldn't answer their questions. once in the emergency room, the doctors and nurses bombarded me with questions that i could barely answer. my main concern was the throbbing inside my mouth. one of the nurses explained to me that i had chewed off part of my tongue as that was one of the effects of having a seizure. i was admitted later in the evening and that was my sister and nephew came to see me. i could tell by the look in her eyes i was in very bad shape.

i was hooked up to several different machines with iv tubes in both arms and a blood pressure cuff that sat snuggly on my left bicep that inflated every 15 minutes; i was on the brink of complete coronary failure. over the next 3 days and nights i was a prisoner to my bed. there were sensors that would trigger an alarm if my legs went to far over the bed, if i tried to sit up it would set them off as well. if had to pee, they brought me a plastic jug and i had piss in the bed with an audience. every 30 minutes the blood pressure guff would inflate and take a reading followed by a nurse coming in and injecting medicine into my ivs. the worst part was i couldn't eat and barely drink because of the pain in my tongue. my speech was incomprehensible as my tongue was so swollen. everyday my sister came to visit and told me she had gone to my apartment to check on my cat and make sure everything was locked up; she even cleaned up the chunks of tongue off the floor.

by friday afternoon i was stable enough to go home, but with strict limitations. no driving, no strenuous tasks and lots of medication. this past friday i finally started eating solid food again; after 2 weeks of pureed food it was like heaven to eat a chicken salad sandwich. everyday i get a little stronger and feel a lot better. i still have trouble with my memory, but i think its good that i don't remember too much about the last year. i spoke to my neighbor; the one who called 911. he told me he had heard me fall and came banging on my door. when i didn't answer he went around to my back door and saw me laying on the floor. he said i looked at him and my face was covered in blood, that was when he called 911. i gave him a hug and he checks in on me daily. my tongue will never heal, but it's a small price to pay to remind me never do that again.

&#x200b;

tl;dr by attempting to detox, i suffered a seizure and chewed through my tongue. if my neighbor hadn't been home to hear me fall, i would've died.

my wife picked our 2 year old son up from daycare where she found him outside, on the ground and sobbing by himself. when she asked the teachers why he was there they said ""he wanted to be there"" because they tried to move him to the shade and he wouldn't go. he also can't move his arm. she tells me this and i call and speak to the director who says she'll talk to the teachers. she calls me back and said the new teachers didn't know him and he was upset when one of them picked him up from behind. i ask how this explains his immobile arm and she has no explanations and says its not fair to jump to conclusions about adults and i explain that i'm not concerned that it happened, but they have a duty to provide a safe environment for my son and they have absolutely no idea how he came to be injured. she has no response. i take him to the doctor, he gets 3 xrays before they conclude nursemaids elbow which he has had before and is common. is there anything actionable or that i should do? i'm clearly not sending him back there, at least. thank you for your time.",2
"thank you guys for giving me the courage to tell my girlfriend.. tldr: told my girlfriend i'm on the spectrum 

earlier today i posted about if should tell my girlfriend i have autism, originally she never wanted to date someone with autism because her brother had low-functioning autism and it drove her mad, even though she loved him. she has never experienced a high-functioning person with autism until she met me, but when we started dating i was too scared to tell her and even more scared when she said she did not want to date someone on the spectrum. when she got home we had a convo and i told her i was on the spectrum, and she started to cry apologizing for what she said a few weeks back. i told her it was okay, and we hugged. she was happy i told her because then she was able to understand some traits i do and have a different look about autism. thank you guys for helping me find the courage to tell her! now i'm sure our relationship will grow stronger! keep changing peoples lives and making others happy! 

just wanna add one more thing, my girlfriend had a reason to say what she said. living with someone with autism depending on the level is very stressful. he is low-functioning, so imagine having a child/sibling who cry's, breaks things, and you have to keep an eye out for them when in public at all times! she was unaware of the different levels of autism and said she will learn more about it for me and her brother, this is why i love her :)

"i'm 30, i'm ""boring"", i'm single, and i've never been more okay with myself.. i'm just not ""cool"" anymore to my friends. i can't stand drinking copious amounts of alcohol anymore. i show up, and i just wish i was at home reading a book with the dog curled up beside me. it's not that i don't ever drink or like to go out, but it's not that fun anymore. i've done it, repeatedly, for about a decade. i look at the drink prices and think of the cab fare (and possibly even the drunk food), and that's a really nice day trip somewhere or an experience i really want to do, like some kind of cooking class or craft workshop. i don't want to have to have friends whom i have to constantly try to outdrink or be loud for hours on end. i don't want to scream over music anymore, and most cocktails taste crappy to me now. besides, i hate that feeling where i'm parched because i haven't had enough water.

i'm now considered the boring friend. i had my drink and i want to go home. just be lucky i even came out. whenever i come out, i just look around me and wish i stayed in now. i want to wake up early and wash the dishes, swiffer the floor, and make a nice avocado smoothie. i find a great sense of satisfaction when i organize that little pile of receipts and papers on my coffee table. i'm kinda now turned on by tracking my spending.

i get that in my circle i'm supposed to be raging til 4am and sleep the sunday away, but i just can't do it. i don't want to take an ibuprofen and drink excess amounts of coffee just to lay about and check my facebook feed, and really, cleaning my home and listening to a nice podcast sets the tone for the start of a new week. i get that i might have missed out on the crazy story, memory, and possibly even sexual experience, but that's fine. i don't want to awkwardly fumble about with a stranger that i have no foundation with anyway. i don't need the validation anymore or the notch on my belt. i'd rather be wearing flannel pants.

i know that this might mean that i am eternally single, and i've accepted this. if ""putting myself out there"" means getting a free drink and throwing myself at a guy , or even worse, playing ""the female who can come on the strongest""  wins, i'll accept my losses. can i please leave now? i used to get really butthurt about this stuff, but i kinda like me now. this took a whopping 30 years, and it's an absolute miracle. i still have a lot of self work to do, but eating decently and moving about and wearing flattering clothes and putting on a little makeup seems to help with my confidence. i think i'm kinda cute and, in dating terms, cast my net out for reasonable. surely, out of 7 billion people, there's some guy out there that also feels the same way i do.

i'm finding myself really interested in trying new things like hiking or even trying out online gaming. i want to forge more meaningful connections with people. now  i'm the boring, (mostly) sober friend, and that's totally okay. i'm willing to set people free. it's funny because i think i've never been so well-rounded as an individual. it saddens me that the people i know don't see how much i've learned or tried. i'm aware i need a different friends group. you don't have to tell me twice.

it's not to say i won't ever go out again, but there's a life outside of the bar.

i'm just now really happy to stay home.

i'm sure millions upon millions of people out there feel similar, so this is hardly interesting or unique. it just feels special to me because it's finally my ""aha"" moment, and mine is: being ""boring"" is cool.

&#x200b;

edit: wow, this is a really odd and cool experience. thanks for the gold. i've never gotten one before! i think i'm painfully average in this feeling, but it's just been an odd revelation. it reminds me of the blink 182 lyric ""well i guess this is growing up."" 

&#x200b;

also, i've been taking legitimate steps to be more purposeful in my social interactions and just overall basic living. i've reached out to a friend about starting dnd. i've been getting more active on meetup, browsing coursera, studying spanish on memrise and goodreads. i figured those are some avenues that some people may be unfamiliar with, and it seems like good hobbies/ ways to meaningfully connect with others. thanks again. <3",11

long story short, i had an abortion, and when she asked me about how my pregnancy was going i lied and said that i'd found out that it was ectopic and had terminated for that reason. not true at all. i had an abortion for a whole bunch of reasons that i'm perfectly capable of articulating most of the time, but to her, i lied. 

this happened years ago and is a small white lie in the scheme of things, but it still bothers me to this day. i hate that i felt the need to excuse myself, that i couldn't own my actions. i don't feel that i have anything to be ashamed of in terms of the abortion, but my lie to her suggests otherwise.

it broke my heart to see my younger sister going through the same thing. picking up what people are leaving behind. and honestly, today, it crushed my soul that she thinks in that matter. it's 3 am, but tomorrow, i am going grocery shopping, picking up chocolate milk gallons, muffins, snacks, pigging out basically. i do not ever want her to ever feel the need to pick up peoples left overs. or ever ask someone for a treat. i always begged the kids around me for snacks when it came to snack time, cause, well, my parents never packed me one. it hurts, it fucking hurts. i'm ending the cycle here and now.

(original post)

i found out last weekend that my fiance is almost definitely cheating on me (99% sure) and i have never felt like this. completely brokenhearted and disillusioned.

long story short: she told me she was going to a concert with her friend -- her friend had scored an extra ticket and asked her. i was happy for her, told her go ahead, have fun.

i got a text from a friend later on that night with a ""bro, isn't that xxx?"" message. a friend at the same concert saw my fiance and her female friend with two men. in the pictures (he sent three) the guy has his arms around my fiance in the middle of the crowd, and in one they are kissing. not a friend kiss, either. liplock, totally into it.

i almost threw up when i saw them. definitely her -- same outfit, etc. and one was a pretty clear closeup of her profile, and i also recognized her friend. i don't know the guy.

i was so broken and ill, i didn't know what to do. i left the apartment and just started walking. i then texted a friend and asked if i could come by. he said sure. as soon as he saw me he knew something was really wrong and sat me down and i spilled it. i cried, the whole works. he was the best, took care of me, got me drunk and high and we sat around all night just talking and drinking. i ended up crashing at his place.

i wake up (it's a sunday, i feel like shit, it's already after 10) and i've got a dozen texts from her -- where am i? why am i not answering? am i in the hospital? she's going nuts (she says).

i just texted her the pic of her kissing the guy, no comment. then she starts calling and texting nonstop so i just turned the phone off.

i haven't been back to our apartment, haven't talked to her. i blocked her cellphone. i can't even see her. i'm afraid of breaking down in front of her and i don't want to do that. we were supposed to get married in april, we were knee-deep in planning. she seemed so happy and excited about our future. now it's all gone.

a few friends know and are behind me. heard through them she is doing everything she can to contact me. she showed up at my work monday morning but i refused permission for her to come up. i also leave by the alley entrance because a colleague texted me yesterday she was sitting in her car outside work. i know eventually i'll have to talk to her, if only to get my shit out of the apartment and cancel the lease and all that. but fuck ... i am broken.

thanks for letting me vent here.

 *****

then i posted a separate update:

first, thank you so much to all who gave support, advice, well-wishing, all of it. (and also reddit gold.) i was and am overwhelmed not only by all the kind words but also by the number of people who have had similar experiences. i wish i could reply to all of you so i hope this is good enough. thank you!

my brother flew in yesterday and got an airbnb through tuesday so i am now staying with him. he is awesome and i am lucky to have him here. as many of you have pointed out i am lucky to have him (and my other awesome family) as well as a great circle of friends. they have been amazing. you do find out who you can count on when shit like this happens.

so, i talked to my ex last night (and yes, she is an ex) after having a long talk with my brother about it. he was there but gave me some privacy. it was awful, as you can imagine, and worse than i even expected, and i was bracing for it to be bad. as soon as she answered she started crying so of course i started crying and it sucked because i really didn't want to cry either on the phone or in front of her. when we could finally talk she just started apologizing and crying and begging me to come back ""home.""

i'll spare you all that was said because frankly it even hurts to write this down. but long story short, when i could get under some control, i asked her who the guy is, what had been happening and basically said you need to tell me all of it, right now. so she told me her friend (who she went to the concert with) and her boyfriend (who the friend was at the concert with) had introduced them when they were all out in june for drinks and dinner (i was visiting family.) she said it wasn't a setup or anything, the guy just happened to be there at the same time. she said he got her number from the friend and started texting her. she said she ignored him but then answered and they started texting. she kept saying she didn't know why she did it. i fucking hate to even write this. she met him for drinks and they went to his place and had sex. she said they've had sex maybe half a dozen times, all at his place, after i basically forced her to tell me, but not sure i believe that for reasons i don't even want to get into. she was crying this whole time and i could barely understand her but she kept apologizing and saying she loved me and was sorry. i was literally trying not to puke. i told her i had to hang up and then basically sat there feeling like someone had literally kicked me in the guts. couldn't breathe, all that. worst feeling ever.

i went and took a walk alone and just zoned out for a bit and then went back and sat with my brother for a bit and we talked and frankly he just sat there hugging me hard. i don't know what i would have done without him there.

so yeah. i sent her an email late last night. telling her i'd be there saturday with my brother and best friend to get my stuff. told her not to be there. told her i had already talked to leasing company. they are letting me out of the lease at the end of october, so told her she can stay there til then (rent is already paid and i will get deposit back too, which is awesome). told her to deal with any wedding stuff. we have a deposit in on a reception venue that we'll probably lose, i don't give a fuck. i told her i don't want a single thing of ours together, she can keep all that shit. i told her i don't want to talk to her or see her anymore. she replied this morning but i haven't read it yet, don't really plan to today.

so that's where things are. again, thank you to all of you who have been so supportive. it really means a lot to me.",11
"i thought i'd be dead from suicide before high school graduation. instead, i'm still kickin' and will be starting my final year of college next week!. i'm writing all of this out in an attempt to show myself how strong i've been and be optimistic that things will get better. i never ever talk about myself unless i have to so this is all weird to me. it's the end of the week and i'm just reflecting back on everything thus far. i hope it all works out. 

here we go: i've battled depression for 8 years, anxiety for 7 years, and had suicidal thoughts for 2-3 of them. i started self harming in 2015 until 2018, meaning i've been 1.5 years clean. i have an abusive parent and a dysfunctional family. i remember setting a deadline for myself to be gone by because things were really that bad and i didn't have anybody. 

i worked my ass off, graduating high school with honors and a year's worth of college credits under my belt (2016). throughout my entire life, i got really good at compartmentalizing to cope. it meant separating emotions from school/work. even was i was feeling suicidal and in tears, i could still be trying to solve calculus problems or do other assignments. the pressure to perform well was always there. because i did well in school and there was never a dip in my grades, none of my teachers suspected anything was wrong. 

i started seeing someone my second year of college (2018), guy #1, who told me to drop out of my major and honors program and choose something easier. he said i was trying too hard. funnily enough, he was a former frat boy who had gotten academically suspended his freshman year and retake classes, used to have an alcohol problem, and was just irresponsible overall with no self awareness (i didn't realize the red flags at the time - i was naive and inexperienced). then he sexually assaulted me. this is when i gave in and hurt myself. that was over a year ago. the next person i saw later that year, guy #2, sexually coerced me as well. they're both out of my life. some believe me, some don't.

during the rollercoaster of emotions, i threw myself into bettering my career (compartmentalizing, once again) and landed an internship. my emotions and those experiences were/are so confusing. i was only a sophomore but really wanted to narrow down what i wanted to do. i found out i really liked health management and ended up adding another bachelor's and related minor my junior year (2019), making it 2 for 2. 

so fuck you guy #1!!! 

this summer, i balanced 4 classes that went 2x as quick as normal classes and 25 hrs/week at the internship (i just got my grades back and have all a's!!!). 

i ended that internship recently due to logistical reasons with travel for the upcoming school year. everything ended on a good note though, my boss is awesome and still wants to keep in touch. but i panicked at the possible resume gap and how it'd affect my chances of landing another one. you see, i need to find a full time internship on my own and complete it to graduate for one of my degrees.

luckily, i just was offered and accepted a job in my field that pays nearly double that and is only on weekends. it's a job typically for people with more experience or a degree. i began training immediately and am picking up on things really quick. today was my 3rd day of training and both my trainer and the director have noticed i'm doing really well. 

i also start classes next week and i'm really nervous. i want to maintain my high gpa to graduate summa cum laude. i'm looking at graduate school soon and know i want a master's. i know i'll keep trying and trying, even when i have super negative thoughts. i have a hard time being proud, optimistic, and not worrying over the same thing over and over again. 


thank you!

edit: thank you! i didn't think it would blow up. i honestly just vented. i was feeling down at the time, like nothing i've done so far was enough. i also will try to respond to everybody but that'll take time. if it helped just one person though that's enough to make me better! also, i'm a girl :)",11

"for being upset that my parents gave my wedding fund to my sister to freeze her eggs?. i want to preface this by saying that i've been 100% financially independent from my parents since the day i graduated college. i know they don't owe me a dime and i'm grateful for everything they've given me in life. 

i have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. my sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and i'm happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. now it's my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. 

my sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. she didn't have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. my sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they're great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. 

i know i sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. there was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. i knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn't want to have an infant at that age. in my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. i don't blame her for being scared. i would have been terrified to. 

but i'm still upset that now i won't be able to have much of a wedding because i had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. i'm not so much upset that they gave it to her, but i am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. that they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. my sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. 

when my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. i couldn't hide my disappointment. i really tried to reassure them that i understood, but they could tell i was hurt. my sister called later and told me that it sucks i can't have a 'fancy wedding' (like hers) but basically i need to grow up. which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. she said she's sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as i'd hoped. 

i know this isn't the end of the world. this is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and i feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. i'm still getting married. my wedding won't compare to my sister's, but i'm still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. 

thanks for sticking with me through the story. i know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. so, am i overreacting? aita?

"it's double sided as fuck to say that demi lovato was courageous when she overdosed on heroin but to then criticize elon musk for smoking some weed on a podcast.. honestly, i saw all the praise being thrown towards demi lovato for surviving an overdose and how courageous and brave she was for it. no she wasn't brave or courageous just because she shot herself up with a bit too much heroin and survived. i then see people getting angry at elon musk for smoking weed on a podcast, angry to the point that tesla lost a shit ton of stock because of it. it's fucking stupid that demi gets brownie points from her fans who ignore the fact that she did heroin in the first place, while those same people were probably tweeting less than kind things towards elon musk. i don't even really like elon musk that much, i just hate the double standard bullshit of it.",6

"is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?. i have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. the moon**

>u/chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the earth, in the form of our moon. simulations (e.g. canup & asphaug 2001(https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), cuk & stewart 2012(https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. wiechert et al., 2001(https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly mars-sized) object collided with the proto-earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-mantle and proto-crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. a moon rock which is actually an earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a moon rock collected by the crew of apollo 14 was probably ejected from the earth about 4 billion years ago. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon(https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: in january of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from earth within it! this would make it an earth meteorite which struck the moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. this would have happened like a game of solar system pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the moon. radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in earth's 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the theia-earth impact event which formed the moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. you can read more on the details here(https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in earth and planetary science letters here(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0012821x19300202). 

**3. moldavite – rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. it formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite(https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. hydrogen and helium** 

>u/slowerthanlightspeed: ""jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric\_escape#jeans\_escape(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric_escape#jeans_escape)   
>  
>atmospheric escape of hydrogen on earth is due to jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\10\ the earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\10\ but a japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the earth.\11\ 

**also volcanoes apparently do not have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction(http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/knowanuknow : it's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. the most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. i thought krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of tnt. but even that isn't enough. it literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 hiroshimas (or 4 tsar bombs) and even that isn't enough. there's something called a verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verneshot(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verneshot)

"by misunderstanding the ugly duckling. the other night, i was out getting a drink with some friends from university, and for some reason or another, the conversation turned to swans.

now, as a kid, i remember reading the ugly duckling - and for some reason, i completely misunderstood it. not the lesson of the story or anything, but the reason that the duckling was ugly in the first place. the reason being that it was, of course, a swan.

but for some reason, i got a few wires crossed, and thought it was in fact a duckling like the rest. instead of thinking that the swan was a different kind of bird, i thought that swans were just male ducks. for some reason i never stopped thinking it, even though i've seen plenty of ducks, and literally had the differences between male and female ones pointed out to me before. i don't know why it never got through to me. i guess i just thought they were different kinds of duck or something.

what this means is that when one of my friends mentioned something about female swans, i scoffed and very loudly proclaimed that ""you can't have female swans"". i stuck by this, convinced they were fucking with me, until they realised i wasn't kidding.

and that's how i, at the age of 19, finally learned that female swans exist. my friends won't stop laughing at me over it, and i really have no defence other than it made sense at the time.

tl;dr i didn't think swans could be female, my friends won't let me live it down.",4
"by having the fbi pull me out of class. obligatory *""this happened a few months ago.""*

this was easily the most stressful roller-coaster of an event that i hope i ever experience. 

the scene is freshman year of college. i'm a wide-eyed innocent student having a great time away from his parents. i've made some good friends and enjoy messing with them. as such, i decide to pull a little prank on them. it starts with a simple idea: i'm going to ohio on a business trip. i was actually going to lunch with my parents, but this was a more fun story. i hadn't initially thought out this entire prank, but just like high school presentations, i decided to wing it. every so often i would go on these out-of-state ""business"" trips, but i stayed vague as to what my business was. i told them that it was somewhat illegal, but in more of a gray area.

my friends were incredibly intrigued by my illicit endeavors, and as time went on, they began to ask more questions about this business. i still had little to no plan for this ordeal, but boy did i milk it. i had them convinced that there were overseas bank accounts with millions of dollars in them and that i had several people involved in this business. at one point i told them the story of how one of my employees got caught trespassing on government property and i had to pay $10,000 to bail him out. i would ""accidentally"" send a picture of several thousand dollars, claiming it was meant to go to someone else with no other explanation.

this went on for several months up until about april. the semester was coming to a close, and i had to figure out a finale for my little project. my roommates were in on my prank and several iterations of plans were discussed. the final version of this ~~bad idea~~ plan was as follows: i will create an email address posing as the chief of police at my college. in the email, the officer (we'll call him bill myers) will inform my friends that he is currently looking to bring in shorttail359 for questioning. i was very specific to say that no one should call 911 or contact anybody outside of this email address with the excuse that there was no official investigation so bill was looking into the matter himself. i then went on to explain how shorttail359 is conducting a business out of university housing and that this is all we know but the business might be illegal/dangerous. in summation: email me if you know of shorttail359's whereabouts, don't call 911, don't contact anyone else in the police department.

i figured i covered my bases and sent the email. it was very well worded and quite convincing to a group of people who already believed i was running a secret business. sure enough, my friends bought it hook line and sinker. one of them replied, informing bill that she didn't know anything about my business, other than that i mentioned it occasionally. three friends ignored the email altogether, and one texted me saying she didn't believe it.

the next three days were interesting. i had several classes with these people and finals were upon us so skipping class was not a good idea, but i had to make them believe i was on the run. fortunately some of these classes had several hundred students and i was able to sit far away from our usual spots. the smaller classes i avoided altogether. meals were eaten at odd times, and at one point i had to hide in the shower because a friend was in my dorm. i had no contact with the prank-ees outside the occasional text.

fast forward to the thursday i decided would be the day to reveal my shenanigans. i'm walking into class when these two men in suits stop me just inside the door. they ask me if i am shorttail359 and upon confirming this they tell me they need to speak with me outside. we walk downstairs to the building's lobby where i am greeted by two more men who have guns at their sides. all four of them hold up their badges in dramatic fashion and one introduces himself as ""agent michael scarn with the fbi"" (fake name obviously). it was approximately at this point that i peed a little bit as i realized that i was in some trouble.

agent scarn: ""do you know why we're here?""

shorttail359: ""no, but i have a pretty good guess.""

agent scarn: ""well why don't you tell us what your guess is?""

i proceeded to explain the email i sent out along with a brief summary of the genesis of my prank. 50 minutes of questioning later and i had given agent scarn the password to the email account, signed an agreement saying i won't access the account or i'd face several charges, given a written statement of the events, crapped my pants twice, and completely missed my class. agent scarn gave me his business card and said they would be in touch.

i go back to my dorm and try to come to terms with the fact that i may have ruined my future career and life altogether. all my friends had a good laugh at my expense but not before i had a good laugh at their expense for believing my stupid business story. after a long sleepless weekend i get a call from a sergeant at the police station. he says that he needs to meet with me and we arrange a time. i go down to the station and for 10 minutes all he does is yell at me and tell me what a stupid idea this was. now i'm a pretty good kid. never got in trouble in school, honor roll, never so much as a speeding ticket, so having a police officer yell at me was a new experience. he finally calms down enough for me to explain that this is an anomale and that it was supposed to be an innocent prank. he believes me and tells me that regardless, they're going to charge me with criminal impersonation which is a class a misdemeanor. my court date is set for a couple weeks from now and that was the end of it.

i go to court fully prepared to leave with a no longer perfect record. as the staff is processing me and taking my mugshot, a lady asks me what my name is. i tell her shorttail359, when a guy jumps around the corner and yells ""but you can just call him chief bill myers!"" this was a much needed laugh and also informed me that word of my idiocy had gotten around town. i go into the court room and waited for this lighthearted judge to call my name. most of the charges were speeding tickets or marijuana related so the judge was moving pretty quickly. however, he calls my name and then pauses. i walk up to the podium and he's still paused, clearly reading over my file. he looks up at me, and then back down at my file again. after reading it completely through, he just starts laughing. several minutes go by before he finally asks me if i have any sort of criminal history. i tell him i don't have so much as a speeding ticket and he asks if i would like to keep it that way. i happily say yes and he give the da my paperwork. the da asks for my story and tells me that he's never seen anything like this before (something i had heard several times at this point). he informs me that this is something they could have expunged as long as i pay my court fees. i thank him and go back to waiting for the judge to call me up again.

when he does, a smile immediately dawns his face and he begins to chuckle. at this point i'm relieved enough to let out a giggle of my own since i can feel the entire court room wondering what i've done. the judge tells me that he will expunge my charge and asks me if i will ever do something like this again. i assure him that i will not and he says, with a smile on his face, ""you know son everyone in this court room is wondering who you impersonated, but i'm going to do something that you should have done and keep my mouth shut."" i thank him and sheepishly walk out of the room.

later that day i took the required documents back to the court and had the whole charge expunged in a matter of hours. it was easily the most stressful month of my life and was not worth it at all, but i am now able to walk around with an fbi agent's card in my wallet and keep a fond memory of being laughed at by a judge.

tl;dr: i play a prank on my friends that ends with me being questioned by 4 fbi agents for almost an hour and charged with criminal impersonation.

i have decided to side with my girlfriend and support her as we figure this out. i'm not going to pretend everything is fine, and i'm not promising that we'll make it through this. honestly i have a feeling we probably won't. but we've been together for 3 years and i believe her about what happened. i think she is a victim even if she didn't handle everything correctly that night. i'm going to support her and try to figure out the full story.

i've read every comment in here. i was responding to many with information in these updates, but there are far too many to reply to. most of the top comments were posted early and are quick to tell me to break up. if you read the rest, they are probably split 60/40 about whether she set it all up or if she was assaulted.

to everyone saying that she should break up with me for how i have handled this so far. please try to understand how emotional this ordeal has been for both of us. she came to me saying she made a mistake and that it was her fault. and she hid it for over a month. i only learned all of this *yesterday* and i freaked out.

\---

original post:

this has turned into a wall of text so i thank anyone who reads. it's probably too much detail, but it's been therapeutic to write it all out.

**background**

i (24/m) have been going out with my girlfriend (22/f) for just over 3 years. we do not live together. we were both living at our parents' houses while attending university but i recently graduated and now have my own place with a roommate. she still lives with her mom, but we have had a few discussions about moving in together.

i work full-time at an office job and she is in class with a part-time restaurant job on the side. she started this job at the beginning of november and was hired by one of her friends. she told me it was annoying that several of the male staff members constantly flirted with her and made inappropriate jokes despite her being in a relationship. this includes the restaurant's bartender (31/m).

in late november (only a couple weeks after she started), the staff had their annual christmas party at the restaurant. it was on a monday night since the restaurant is closed tuesday mornings.

later that week, my girlfriend was also supposed to be housesitting/dogsitting for a friend. she had to go feed the dog every day and was allowed to stay overnight if she wanted (starting tuesday). we were talking about how we both thought it was hot to have sex in someone else's house, and planned to have a few wild nights when we got the chance.

**my side of the story**

i stayed home the night of the party. i was told it was staff only (no significant others) and i had work in the morning, so i  had no problem staying in. i dropped my girlfriend off and i was texting her throughout the night. at around 11 i told her i was going to sleep and said goodnight. i was still up another hour or so, but based on her texts she was quite drunk and it was frustrating having a regular conversation, so i didn't want to text any more.

i sent her a message the next morning and didn't hear back until around 2pm, when she informed me she was extremely hungover and slept half the day. even though her mom's house was just around the corner from the restaurant, she said she instead decided to go to the dogsitting house (a day early) since it was on the way to the bar that some people headed to after the party. apparently the homeowners left earlier monday night.

we hung out later that night and she showed me photos of the party. i saw most people brought their significant others, and i was kind of insulted. i confronted her about it and she said she didn't think we were supposed to be invited and that i shouldn't have cared since i had work the next day anyways. we had a minor disagreement but nothing serious.

the next couples days were normal, we were happy, and thursday night i suggested we go over the dogsitting house together. she started acting weird and said she didn't want to do that any more, but we could hang out at my place. we did, watched some tv, and i tried to initiate sex. she refused and said i was being too pushy and went home. i didn't think i did anything wrong and i was frustrated.

the next two weeks or so were more of the same. no sex, which led to frustration and silly arguments over little things. she started exams in mid/late december and stress was through the roof. finally, after she finished exams we went out to a party, went home together and had sex. it had been probably 3 weeks, and previously we were having sex \~5 times a week.

over the christmas break we resumed having lots of sex, but things still didn't feel right. there were lots of arguments. we both returned to work/school and it seemed like every day there was some new disagreement. and now today... we were fighting about something stupid (whether or not her friend calling me ""garfield"" should be insulting), and trying to resolve it. i made an offhand comment about how these little fights shouldn't bother me so much, it's not like she cheated on me.

and then she broke down. she started sobbing and saying that she made a huge mistake at the christmas party. she said she couldn't bear to tell me and wanted to kill herself.

**her side of the story**

after the crying stopped, i made her tell me what happened. i was pretty pissed off and yelling because she basically told me she cheated on me a month and a half ago and tried to hide it. this is her side. a lot of it is pieced together from her messages and what her coworkers told her, since she has no little memory of the night.

the party was open-bar, and she and her friend were hanging out at at bar most of the night. the bartender was another employee who had volunteered to take the night off from drinking to serve everyone else. partway through the night, he started giving her drinks that she wasn't even asking for. she was having a good time and accepted them. eventually she got blackout drunk, still pretty early in the night too. she doesn't remember me texting her goodnight, which was only around 11pm.

at midnight, she texted the dogsitting people asking if she could go over that night. there was no answer of course, since they were on an international flight somewhere. everyone kept drinking until about 12:30 am. around 1 am, the bartender drove a group of people from the party to a bar. he returned to the party to drive the last carload of people to the bar. everyone else had made their way home by this point.

he dropped everyone at the bar except my girlfriend. he told the others he would drive her home, but together they then went back to the dogsitting house. i don't know the exact details of what happened next. but around 3 am, she sent a photo to their work group chat. it includes her, the bartender, and the dog in a bed. you could only see from their shoulders up but they were obviously shirtless. she included a message that said ""i hope everyone is having a good time! i know we are!""

she insists she has zero recollection of this happening. she woke up tuesday lunchtime and was surprised she wasn't in her own bed. the bartender wasn't there when she got up and there was no sign of him. she said she assumed she must have decided to go out to the bar after, which is why she asked to stay at the dogsitting house instead of her own.

apparently she didn't find out what happened until thursday when she was talking to her friend. she was shown the picture she sent, which was since buried in the group chat. she still insists she has no memory of anything, and freaked out and didn't know what to do. that's why she refused to go to that house with me and why things suddenly got so weird between us. she says she wanted to deny to herself that it happened and didn't want to tell me.

after finding out the truth today, there has been lots of yelling and crying, and i'm currently home by myself.

**my thoughts**

first of all, i do believe she was taken advantage of. she was blackout drunk and the bartender was sober (and significantly older). her coworkers all confirmed that the bartender told everyone he was dropping her at home, and also that he was feeding her free drinks all night. i also believe she didn't remember it happening at first, because there was a definite mood change on thursday, which lines up with when she said she found out.

however, i can't help but feel like she was willing even if she was drunk. i'm hurt and it feels like i was cheated on. it's not like the bartender took her home against her will and assaulted her. she figured out the logistics of finding a place to go with him and looked extremely happy in the photo.

why it still feels like cheating:

* i was told i wasn't invited to the party when everyone else brought their sos.
* she had access to the dogsitting house a day earlier than i thought.
* she had brought the key to dogsitting house to her work party, even though it was right next to her mom's house.
* the bartender is a guy who had openly flirted with her for weeks.
* she didn't tell me what happened for over a month, and had planned on hiding it forever.

in anger i told her that if this wasn't cheating then she must have been sexually assaulted. and that if we don't press charges then at the very least we need to ensure the bartender loses his job. she cried again and refused to do either. since she can't remember the night, she isn't willing to report him for anything and can't confirm she didn't want it.

what do you guys think? i'm an emotional mess right now and struggling to be logical. do i need to put emotion behind me and support her as a victim? or is she a cheater? things were great before this and i had hoped to spend my life with this girl.

&#x200b;

**update 1:**

i spoke to her again today and said that there were too many coincidences that make this seem like she planned it out. i told her i needed a bit of time to figure this out but i didn't think i would be able to move past it. i know drawing this out is probably not the best way to handle anything but all logic goes out the window when you're the one involved in a mess like this. however, there are still a few updates worth mentioning.

* we looked at the photo again, and it really looks like **the bartender took the photo!**
* there were only 2 coherent messages she sent after i said goodnight: 1 to the homeowners and 1 along with the photo in the groupchat. she had a few other messages to a non-work friend during this time that are complete nonsense.
* she showed me an earlier message where her friend said the party was staff only.
* she insisted she had never messaged the bartender except within the work group chat. she showed me unaccepted facebook and snapchat invites from him, and said she didn't even have his number. she was willing to let me use a recovery tool to prove they had never messaged but i didn't go through with it.
* she had the key on her keychain since she picked it up from the homeowners (like a week in advance). she is so adamant about this that she was checking photos she took of her odometer hitting 100k to see if her keys were visible, but no proof.
* she said she would be willing to report the bartender to work for sexual harassment, but was still uneasy about pressing charges.
* she still went through with it and hid it from me, so even if her story is completely true somehow, i'm not sure if i can move past it.

"an employers point of view of someone not getting paid.. ive spent a lot of time reading this subreddit and almost every week or so, without fail, someone posts something about how their employer is doing something shady, trying to not pay them, giving them bad checks, etc. and everyone here immediately goes to 'call department of labor on their ass! these weasels are stealing from you!'. and i am not suggesting it doesnt happen, but i am here to tell you a short version from the employers point of view. 

my wife and i run a small shop, have 3 great employees and my wife works a ton with them. we tried hiring someone else, immediately saw it was a bad fit, and let her know we werent able to continue her employment. fast forward a week, we had a problem with our payroll and instead of direct deposit, we had to cut checks for everyone. we immediately emailed her to let her know, told her she could pick it up. she opted for us to mail it to her and the next day, we did. 

since then, i've been told i am running a scam, i am a con artist, thief, threatened, 2am emails, etc. first it took the post office 5 days to get her the check. not much i can do. then it took 3 days for the bank to deposit the check. again, not much i can do. everything was our fault despite us trying to help her get her money as fast as we could.

i dont want to get too far into details and eventually the check cleared, but a lot of people here are quick to start blaming employers for payment issues. sometimes, things are out of employers hands. sometimes, people bend their perspective of things where they are a victim and quickly come looking to others to validate their point of view. in my case, there was nothing more i could do to help this person, but i was still the piece of shit who was trying to steal from someone.

"censoring ""hate speech"" makes you a coward. it shows that you're too afraid to debate your opponent and that them merely being alowed to speak intimidates you. 

no matter how wrong, offensive, violent, or amoral you think someone is, policing words is not the way to go. it creates an orwellian echo-chamber where one set of ideas or opinions is considered ""right"" by virtually everyone. morality is a social construct and therefore a highly subjective thing. if you truly believe someone is incorrect, stand your ground and attack them with words instead of crying ""pls remov dem from teh internet"" like a little baby. are people just so sensitive that seeing words on a screen will cause them to spontaneously combust?

"for becoming hysterical at a school secretary's expense?. throwaway- im just going to get in to it.

i (19m) got a call from my mother frantically telling me that she got a call from my sister's school because apparently she had ingested peanuts, she is deathly anaphylactic, i was at home for reading week, and am studying for upcoming midterms, but dropped everything and drove as legally fast as possible to get down to the school.

i ran in to the the office which was really crowded. there was only one secretary, and i knew instantly who it was- my mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

i ran in but there was a line up, i told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if i was blind ""there's a line hun"".

i waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

i got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""ready to talk to me"" i was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. i was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation i was in.

i dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. the secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

she started by telling me ""see hun, i told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, a student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, i could have handled this situation a lot better- i have a lot of students to deal with""

i looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

i yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""the school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

are you serious? how am i supposed to react in that situation? yes, i agree i was really angry, but i feel like i was justified- my sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- i would have waited if i heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. aita?

edit- 

to add context, some people are confused as to why i didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) i don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, i guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",3

"i snooped on my brother and found something horrifying. i just found something pretty disturbing, and i'm not sure what really to do next.

my brother is usually a super private person and doesn't hand out his phone to anyone. we're currently on a family vacation overseas and he is the only one with a working data plan, so we've been using is phone quite a bit. his open web tab was on a popular fiction website, and i saw his logged in username before he swapped tabs to a new one.

i frequent the site too, and when back in the airbnb, went to check his profile to see if he too ran in the same fandoms as me. i must admit that this situation is entirely my fault as i snooped. i know i shouldn't have, but i was so curious. to my surprise, he had a few published works, but when i opened one, i almost puked - his latest story was of a brother violently raping his sister in graphic detail, who had the same first name and general description as me, in a setting i recognised as my parent's house. he insulted my eldest sibling and also my parents in horrible ways too. i won't go into further detail but suffice to say it was the single most horrifying thing i've ever read. ever.

now i'm in the bathroom of this airbnb typing this and i'm not sure how i'm going to go out and face my family. should i just ignore this? is this normal and am i overreacting? i mean, everyone has their kinks and my brother has never, ever acted inappropriately towards me or anyone in my family in real life. please tell me this is so.

urgh. moral of the story, don't snoop, never ends well.

edit: i am 19f and my brother is 23m.

**update**: thank you to those who replied, i still have no idea what i'm going to do. i really do get that it is fiction, and i completely understand that part of the appeal is to push characters to extremes because it would never happen in real life. it would not have disturbed me at all if the people involved were literally any other fictional character, emphasis on the fictional. all i expected when i searched his profile was to find a list of his favorite fics and thought we could discuss any shared fandoms, and i know i shouldn't have gone looking. didn't expect him to be an author, much less this. sorry for the long para, it's late at night and i can't bring myself to sleep in the same room as my brothers, might just crash on the couch where i am at now. also i'm planning to beg off tomorrow's planned tour, will catch up on sleep then.

**next morning update**: the fam is out for the day, managed to stay back at the airbnb & the wifi. there has been a split of opinions down below and there are many who think that the writings are just writings, and private. i think i will give him the benefit of the doubt this time. i don't think i have the stomach to upset everything if so. i'll be back out of the house for college soon, so there will be distance. thanks for listening to my earlier confused post!",7

"update - we broke up i 21f got blackout drunk and told my friends 21f 22f 22f that my boyfriend's 25m jacked off to their instagram pics. long story short, i broke up with pete. but if you want the details… i'd been feeling kind of insecure about his loyalty to me for a while, the instagram thing from my last post was just the tip of the iceberg. 

&#x200b;

then, shortly after christmas, i got a text from bridget, a friend from college, we're in the same program, we have a lot of classes together and study together for our exams. we're not super close friends outside of studying, we have different interests and groups of friends, but we still spend a lot of time together doing homework and studying.

&#x200b;

she basically said that she had something that was weighing on her. she hadn't wanted to tell me before exams, because she knew i was stressed and just trying to make it through finals week… then she didn't tell me before christmas, because she didn't want to ruin my holidays, but she felt like she had to say something now. i asked her what it was, and she told me that pete had been dm-ing her and trying to hit on her, and she hadn't answered and he just escalated, getting mad at her for being online but not answering, then she blocked him. she said nothing went on, she was disgusted by how he'd hit her up when he was in a relationship with me. 

&#x200b;

she sent me screenshots so i know she's for real. anyway, i was taken aback when she first told me, but the more i think about it, the less i am surprised. i was glad she waited till after exams to tell me, this week has been messy emotionally and i know it would have hurt me academically if i was going through all this during finals week.

&#x200b;

so yeah, i'm not feeling the best right now, i feel pretty damn hurt and used, but i guess the silver lining is that i'll be going into my next semester drama free, and 190 pounds lighter.

&#x200b;

my friends, that i mentioned in my last post, have been very sweet and supportive and i feel so very lucky to have them in my life right now.

tldr - pete was trying to cheat on me. i broke up with him. i feel crappy but i'm starting to get past it. ",7

"(update) my mother said she would kill herself the day i graduate high school (wa). hey. well, some time has passed since i made the original post(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/amczek/my_mother_said_she_would_kill_herself_the_day_i/?st=jxce4177&sh=bd06a7bf) was made, and an update is here!

well, i have some good news. after i made the original post, i talked with my mother about the situation, and what was going on. once i confronted her about it, she started crying. she said that she had fulfilled her purpose in life, and it's time for me and my brother to fulfill ours. i disagreed, and told her to stop with that, and made her a promise. if she kills herself, then her purpose would not be fulfilled. she wouldn't be able to meet the expectation that i want her at my college graduation, or at my wedding, or at any other celebrations of achievements. i told her that i need her to stay alive and that it's not negotiable no matter, as her simply being somewhere gives hope for future endeavors.

last monday, i graduated from high school with my friends, and finished my first year of college at the same time! it was a good time, and i finally get some breathing room for a little bit. i went home, hung out with some people, and then went to bed. to this day, she's alive and well, doing what she would normally do on a day to day basis. i wanted to wait a week to ensure everything would be okay, and i'm glad to report that it is. 

the day that i made the original post, it was closing night of a school play for which i was a part of. with many people in that theater department being on reddit, a couple of people put the dots together and know that i posted that. to those whom i know irl, i'm doing okay, and everything will be alright. you know where and how to contact me if you need me, love you guys. to everyone, thank you guys for the kind messages, both on the thread and in pm's. i'm thankful for even in a legal subreddit, people are kind and caring. love you guys. 

finally, if you're feeling suicidal, feeling like you don't belong, or going through a hard time, there are places to go to get help. not only on reddit, or on any social media, but through phone calls and facilities that you can go to. i know it's posted everywhere always, but if you need someone immediately, at any given time, please call the lifeline below. thank you, and with love <3

"way late update: my mom stole a trust fund i didn't know i had and now the irs is coming after me for unpaid taxes.. original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/39tlzj/mom_stole_a_trust_fund_i_didnt_know_i_had_now_the)

i'm only three years late but wanted to update this post. 


i reached out to the irs who, after several phone calls and hours on hold, told me nothing could be done and to just pay up. i called one more time and a much nicer agent told me more kindly that nothing could be done unless i could get my mother to admit to withdrawing the money in writing.


i told her that if she just told the truth, admitted it to me and the irs and wrote the letter, i would forgive her and we could put it behind us. she refused. i told her to not contact me again until she was ready to stop blaming others and admit what she had done.


a few (blissfully calm) weeks later she called me and apologized. she wrote a handwritten letter stating she withdrew the money without my knowledge and none of the proceeds went towards my care. i wrote my own letter explaining that i was already an adult immigrating to another country at the time of the withdrawal, and attached a photocopy of my passport stamps, an affidavit that i had never lived at the address the cheque was sent to, and the receipt of my immigration application which was dated prior to the withdrawal. i asked that the tax liability be transferred to my mother and included her ss number which she signed off on.


the irs sent me a letter back stating that the taxes owing would be issued under my mother's name. because she was a jobless crack addict, her income was under the federal threshold and she did not need to pay anything due to how low her income was that year. disaster averted.


for those curious, no, i never got the money back and decided not to pursue it. i didn't know it existed before the irs contacted me, and didn't feel it was in anyone's best interest to force the issue knowing that i'd never get repaid anyways. mom quit crack a year or two back, but still battles her demons in the form of alcoholism. our relationship has slightly improved. also, i'm a woman (most comments assumed i was male). the end.",2
"for telling my so he'll need to limit gym time after baby?. i'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and have a 15 month old. this pregnancy is a surprise and honestly, i wasn't sure we should have another, because we had a rough go with our first. during the newborn phase, i was so exhausted. i was breastfeeding, baby had colic, i was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. i do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and i was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).

my husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. he would silently be ticked if i asked him to not go to the gym. i truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). but sometimes, that ""help"" wasn't enough. sometimes, i needed another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. example: one saturday i got up to pump. they were both awake (8:00am). he said he was going to head to the gym since i was awake, and i started crying saying ""please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and i got maybe three hours or so of sleep"" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me ""sleep in."" i told him that it must be nice to even have the energy to go to the gym. the only thing i wanted to be able to do was sleep. i got the response ""i'm sorry you hate being a mom!""

now that i'm pregnant again, i mentioned to him ""if i thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am i supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?"" i told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. well, he did not receive this kindly. he texted me the next day ""just to be clear, i feel like i do a lot. i will not be able to help out with daycare, as i drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. i will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and i need to go to relieve stress. the reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while i think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored. you need to think about if you want this baby.

i fucking lost it.

he seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why i did not want to have a dick and i basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like i don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. hard pass. he got weirdly offended by this and said i was being sexist??? i told him that i observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if i had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. he got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me ""think about"" why what i said was so upsetting.

"*update* textbook scam. good news! i posted a week or so ago about a company that sent me a different textbook then the one in the photo, and claimed the international version was  specified in the description. then was demanding me send it to malaysia for return, which would have cost as much as the book (the book was over $100). i sent many emails, then they did not respond for a couple days, conveniently those couple days were the last couple days in the 'refund time', meaning the book was no longer eligible for a refund. to say the least i was not happy. my bank said they could not do anything (i was given that advice on here), so i researched the canadian government on consumer laws. shortly after this i had reported this company to the consumer laws in my district. they replied with 'thank you for bringing this to our attention', and within 5 hours i recieved an email from the company with a full refund, and with the book still sitting on my table.

in conclusion, there are always two sides of every story. i am not a monster or a gold digger. we go on very cheap dates  every few weeks ($10-$30) and i've thanked him every time he would offer to pay. i have paid for some. i just wanted to give my say in this. we are no longer together as of tonight. i sincerely appreciate everyone who took the time to give an opinion stating that there may be more to the story than he is willing to share. i hope i have a partner who loves me enough to give me the benefit of the doubt, and talk to me in a more positive light.

edit: people have been saying i hate kids. this isnt the case. i just take issue when some kid mentions their age on the internet as if it furthers an argument or statement they are making. if your point is solid, it can stand up without mentioning ur age. no one asked for your age. there are a few times when one would talk about age on the internet, but kids simply do talk about age at appropriate areas/threads/whatever. like ive seen 12 year olds on r/relationshipadvice. let your actions define you. ifind kids who mention age are either super serious like they are superior or super cringey. just let your actions define you. unless u try to act like an adult, people will still tell u are r/iamverysmart or a complete immature loser.

all of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. the man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. when the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. only then does the man realize how hungry he is. a guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

the beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""that one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. all the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. i've heard the food is better there.""

so the man gets his food. it's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. the guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. it's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. all the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. and to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""what are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. the beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. when the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. on a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. a cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. the beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""that's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" the man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

while he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""the best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. you can never get tired of it!""

sadly, this proved not to be true. after only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. but he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. this time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. after ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. he went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

and wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. the man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""come,"" the beggar told him, ""i'll take you to the evening meal."" so the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. and sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. one of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""that's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals four times a year!""

the man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. four changes a year was enough for him. but one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""what is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what i have here?"" that question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. he was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. when he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. the architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. to his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

the beggar laughed jovially. ""i got here only three years ago myself, but somehow i knew you would be right here behind me. i've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. the room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. an angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""that's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""what is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

the beggar replied, ""there appears to be no punchline.""

"update: art cartel. i posted a while ago about a business in town claiming i was running a cartel.
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7a3xi4/apparently_im_running_an_art_cartel/


i figure i owe a follow up to all the crazy that has happened, even though most of it is social small town drama and not ""legal"".  still, it's been an insane month.  for ease, i'm just going to refer to both people and places as gallery a, gallery b and gallery c.  (also i got a lot of guesses as to my shop and town. also i got a lot of guesses as to where i live. at least one was correct but i'm not going to verify because i don't want john harassed.)

coming off of the first post i made, john was continuing to make weird statements online.  i had a few people who are friends with him agreeing to take screenshots.  in one, he was petitioning for funds to bring a lawsuit against the three banditos.  someone asked what his proof was that we were hurting his business, and he posted a weird combination of google pictures of our storefronts, an ad for one of our events, and a listing in an old ad for downtown businesses that was printed a year before he went into business.  he also linked to a several year old interview from gallery a about supporting high school artists.

i had my meeting scheduled with my lawyer on tuesday nov 7th, but he called on monday.  when i answered the phone he joked ""i'm really disappointed in what a terrible art cartel you're running.""  it turns out my lawyer's secretary had been at the coffee shop when john was trying to get money and kept a copy of the list of grievances.  when i arrived for the meeting on tuesday, my lawyer had a downright sassy letter ready to go for john which told him that any future threats would be taken seriously and then helpfully referred him to the definitions of a cartel.

for a few days, nothing.  then my lawyer, i and the other galleries all get a copy of john's list of grievances in the mail.  this was the first i read it, but essentially pinpoints me as the head of the art cartel based on the fact that i was the one to sign the contract for the advertising page we took out in the local tourist book.  he also points out we have similar hours of operation we established without consulting him.  (a note about this.  we don't have the exact hours.  we just all are open similar times to the other businesses and restaurants around us because of traffic flow).

he also claims gallery a is committing fraud as they show original pieces but also sell framed prints of the same work at more reasonable prices.  a new addition was the commentary that i (me, personally) had conspired with an ice cream place near him and told them to reduce their hours for the winter in order to hurt his traffic.  (the fact that they always reduce hours because ice cream doesn't sell in winter apparently wasn't it). there were a few other points, but those were the most bizarre.

my lawyer cc'd me on a letter that can be summed up ""seriously, knock it off,"" and told him he was banned from my shop.

on veteran's day, i got a call from the high school art teacher.  she told me that john had called her and told her not to work with local galleries anymore.  he said that if she ceased working with us that he would give her brochures for ""legitimate"" art schools for her students.  when she said she planned to continue working with us, john said that she was leading her students to poor practices.  she contacted me afraid that there would be issue with her students.  i said i didn't foresee any issue, but thanked her for her information.  i said if it escalated, i'd ask her to speak to my lawyer.

a few days later, i get a screenshot of john's facebook page that has listed ""the three banditos are at it again"".  it links to two upcoming events we were advertising for the holiday crowd.  it also included a fantastic photoshop collage of myself, the other gallery owners and a local jeweler, each wearing a black cowboy hat and bandana.  later that day the jeweler called to jokingly ask me if there was an initiation process to join the banditos.  we have no idea why he is included, he wasn't part of the promotion john linked.

i found out at this point that john previously attacked a paint and sip that's run by a local business on the local tourist facebook page.  he posted a pic of one of their previous group photos with ""this is not art"" written across it. he pulled it after several people pointed out his high end gallery shouldn't feel threatened by a paint and sip.  but before he did gallery c responded by posting magritte's treachery of images, which is so funny in so many levels.

then things escalated again.  on nov 13th, john posted a pic on facebook of gallery b, which is located on a corner, with sidewalks only on one side.  he pointed out that if someone were to take the corner too quickly, they would crash into the building.  then asked people to do the ""right thing"" and drink and drive around the block a few times.  it turns out gallery b and john are in the same professional organization, and they look poorly on threats.  gallery b sent screenshots as well as a copy of john's list of grievances and john was put on probation with the organization pending review.

the next morning, john is outside my shop screaming that he knows what i did and that i have spies.  he didn't enter the premises and left when i threatened to call police, but i did get video of him on my phone.  the same day he removed anyone local from his facebook.  that afternoon, john apparently went to a local restaurant and hassled the owner for details about what we are doing to ruin his business.  the restaurant eventually threw him out, but up until then the owner hadn't heard any of this, so he called me to ask what the heck this was about.

nov 16th, i was opening shop when a friend sends me a picture of john in handcuffs.  we rent advertising space at a historic site where local information is kept.  john was found vandalizing our poster, its frame, and the acrylic cover.  he did this during the day when employees were around, no clue how he thought he would get away with it.  he got a fine for his troubles, but it got more gossip out there.  turns out i wasn't the first threatened with lawsuits in the community.  i passed this onto my lawyer.

the weekend before thanksgiving, there was a meeting of the group that handles the downtown events, projects etc.  most shops are fairly active with the group and the meetings are open to the public.  as far as i know john has never attended a meeting until this one.  they were discussing the finalization of christmas tree lighting and christmas events when a john asked for time to speak.  he handed out this paper to everyone present which had a summary of his financials at his old, city gallery and a summary of his financials at his new gallery.  then he apparently said ""i think we all know whose fault it is that theres a difference.  i'm not naming names.""  then he glared at everyone until they got him to leave the podium.

i was given a copy of this by someone who attended the meeting.  john isn't doing well financially. i turned it over to my lawyer.

the day before thanksgiving there was a notice posted on the community bulletin board.  it stated that there is a conspiracy in town to put new businesses down.  it then refers to ""certain individuals"" and ""certain unnamed shops"", and has several of the same bullet points as john's list of grievances.  it also says those certain individuals have paid off all local lawyers from representing the person who put up the poster.  this notice was removed from the bulletin board as everything posted there needs prior approval.  gallery c happened to hear about it and fished it out of the trash.  we turned it over to my lawyer.

i had hoped things would de escalate now that i was downgraded from bandito to the nameless one, but no such luck.  that saturday, the 25th, we hosted an event with refreshments.  the way this works is that we sell admission and you get a wristband and go from participating shops and galleries for food.  john did not participate, as usual.

at some point during the afternoon, two of the participants went into john's shop.  when he saw the wristbands, he went into the back and came out with a scissors.  he told them to be in his gallery, they had to cut the wristbands off.  when they refused, he grabbed at the woman's hand still holding the scissors, and was yelling.  the two left the gallery and reported it to a police officer.  their next stop was gallery b, where they told this story.  my lawyer has been unable to get verification for this incident from police.  (this is also, as far as i know, the last time the gallery was open.)

the next day, sunday, i got a visitor in my shop who was acting weird.  he was asking my employee detailed questions about the business:  where did we get our artwork, what did we pay, how much was rent.  when i overheard this i came over and realized the guy bore a striking resemblance to john, only younger.  let's call him john jr.  i introduced myself and he asked me if i had any upcoming promotions.  in response, i handed him a copy of the monthly booklet the town puts out, which has basically everything happening in the area, including our events.  john jr looked surprised, and asked me where else he could get this booklet.  i gave him a list of places offhand.  he then asked me if everywhere got the same copy.  i said they did and it was also available online.  i was really hestitant that i was giving john information , but figured by only giving easily found public info, i was ok.

john jr left, but i found out he went to a coffee shop and asked if they had a copy of the booklet and asked a ton of questions about it and my shop.

gallery c contacted me last monday to let me know that john had gotten into a heated argument with a man matching john jr's description on the sidewalk near gallery c.  john jr had left and driven away.

by last wednesday, john had a sign on the door of his gallery stating it would be closed any day there is a planned downtown event listed online.  as there's something happening nearly every day for the holidays, this would mean he will be closed essentially all of december.

the next day, gallery c got a letter from john.  it told him to stop walking by the front of john's store, and claims to have ""hours of footage"" of him passing by.  he then threatened to sue gallery c for using the public sidewalk. (gallery c and john are on the same street and gallery c needs to use the parking lot past john's store, so he does pass by twice a day.). at this point, gallery c decided to retain my lawyer.  he was told to cross the street instead of passing directly in front of john's gallery for the time being, but our lawyer also sent a response letter.  gallery c informed me of this after their meeting.

at this point, i also found out through the grape vine that john had attempted to hire my lawyer some weeks prior in order to sue me, only to be told it would be a conflict of interest.

john responded by sending our lawyer a rambling, multi page letter that had some elements of his list of grievances and other additions.  while it probably was in response to gallery c, most of it was directed at me, so my lawyer showed it to me.  it was mostly insulting my business and saying i purposefully am putting him out of business.  it also includes that john attempted to get this put in the local newspaper some weeks prior, but they turned him down.  we are trying to get verification of this.  my lawyer basically says if john does anything else, he is bringing the hammer down on him, and sent a letter to this effect.

at dinner, i heard a rumor john is behind on his rent and the landlord is planning evictions after the holidays.  because his gallery has been closed, i haven't seen john since thanksgiving weekend.

gallery b sent a christmas card with a cropped pic of himself in a black hat and bandana from john's facebook, framed in a wreath.  he wants us to take a group photo in black cowboy hats and bandanas for next year's local business review.  i'm debating it.",2

"my bf (20m) lied to me about wearing a condom. what do i do now??. i originally posted this on r/sex but was advised to post it here as well to get additional feedback. 

so my bf and i just got a new apartment together a few weeks ago and are kinda new to the living together thing. since we are still sorting out our financial situation and i'm not on the pill, i asked him to buy condoms bc i didn't want an accident to happen and i either have to buy an emergency contraceptive or end up pregnant. he initially said no but after about 2 days he agreed (although rather grumpily). tonight during sexy time, he wore a condom and then afterwards took it off and threw it away. a little while later, he asked if i wanted to go for round two and i agreed. i felt him reach for another condom and heard the crinkling of the wrapper and even him opening the wrapper so naturally i assumed he put a new one on. midway through, he asked if he could take off the condom and i told him no. he  then told me that he actually hadn't been wearing one the whole time during round two. i immediately got out from under him and got upset. i felt like he broke my trust. he then actually put the condom on and said for me to calm down and that he was just playing around and wanted to continue since he now had a condom on. i was still very upset and told him no bc that's not cool. he got angry and took the condom off and threw it at the wall. i then got dressed and went to the spare bedroom. i heard him get out of bed and close the door after me. after cooling down for a few hours, i was going to go back and talk to him but i found the door locked. he locked me out of the room. i then texted him that i was sorry but that he shouldn't have done that. i little bit later and i heard snoring in the room and the door is still locked so i'm staying in the guest bedroom tonight. i am still kinda upset and can't shake the feeling of betrayal. i personally don't think that i'm in the wrong but maybe i'm just too close to the situation. am i the bad guy?? am i overreacting?? does he have a right to be mad at me?? please give any advice you may have. i would really appreciate it.

update: first of all, i just wanted to say that i didn't expect to get so much interaction let alone well wishes and support. i am so thankful for everyone and although i can't reply to every comment, i'm at least trying to look at them all. also, i am back on birth control. now on to what happened yesterday. 

when i woke up friday morning, bf was already up and getting ready for work. as soon as he left, i went into his room and started gathering my belongings to move into the guest bedroom. i guess he forgot something bc he came back inside and found me in his room collecting my things. he told me that he loved me and that he was sorry for what he did and he shouldn't have been the one to get mad. he also said that although he didn't want me to, he wouldn't stop me from moving my things into the guest bedroom if that's what i wanted. i should have said something to him then but i knew that what i had to say was a lot more than the 10 minutes he had before he had to leave for work so i stayed quiet and looked at the floor. he hugged me and called me his baby and then left for work fr this time. we didn't speak anymore until later that evening when i asked him if he could pick me up from work (i currently don't have a car). he agreed. during the ride home, he acted casually as if nothing had happened less than 24 hours before. when we got home, bf started cooking dinner. i didn't know how to start the conversation so i sat and thought on it. later that night, i went into his room and he already knew why i was in there. i told him that what he did the night before was not okay and that since we got the apartment he had been meaner and way more aggressive toward me which lead me to think that he didn't actually want to get the apartment. i reminded him of the condom incident and a few others before that and told him if he wanted to break the lease, we could and that i would find another place to stay in the meantime. he started crying and apologized and said that he didn't even realize what he was doing and that he didn't want to be like his dad (who was very abusive). he said that it wasn't his intention and that he was very sorry. he also said that he loved getting the apartment and wanted to stay. he also said that if i wanted to keep my stuff in the guest bedroom, he would respect and support my decision and that i was welcome to the master with him whenever i felt like it. he said that he appreciates me telling him about his fuck ups so he can learn from them and that he'd do his best to be better. then we said good night and i went back to my room.

"youtubers are no longer regular people just recording themselves having fun, but paid marketing agents for various companies.. so my son watches youtube rather than tv obviously because that's just the way things are now. the thing is, i've noticed a disturbing trend amongst these videos especially the ones that are about games, specifically roblox. 

it seems that these kids always  play the same games amongst multiple different supposedly unrelated channels almost like it's coordinated to make a video according to some schedule. not only that they always seem to have unlimited robux and always show how much more fun the game is when you use robux to play. this seems like a coordinated campaign to me and seems especially odd when grown ass adults are playing roblox, which i can't even comprehend.

"by asking about my parenta divorce and found out i contributed to the divorce.. update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/co5hbl/tifu_update_asking_about_my_parents_divorce_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

okay, first off, my parents have been divorced for 12+ years. i am 21 now and was 7 or 8 when they split. i found out a few years ago it was because my mom was cheating on my dad with my nurse from the nicu from 1997 (oof).

casually talking to my mom (who has since remarried for the third time) i asked about their divorce out of curiosity. she went into a few details and brought up a car ride with my dad. she wouldnt elaborate so i called my dad (big mistake)

mind you, dad took me and my sister in when my mom left and raised us. it kind of went like this:

me: ""so i was talking to mom about your divorce and she brought up a ride in the car with you that initiated the divorce""

dad: *hesitantly* "" yeah, you, me and your sister were in the car when i came back from overseas and we were talking about what you guys wanted to be when you grew up. your sister said something and you said ""i want to be a nurse like, insert his name here"". i pulled over to the side of the road and you spilled the beans""

apparently, at 7 or 8, i informed my dad about a guy staying in our house in his room sleeping in their bed while he was gone for months for military stuff. i told him everything. how mom told us he was an ""old friend"" who needed ""help"" and who would be staying with us ""to protect us while daddy is gone"". how he watched us for a week while mom disappeared, took us to movies, dinner, etc. there was a point of him asking if i would move to california with him and my mom (they got married 2 weeks after my parents divorce was finalized and moved to california)

i never remembered this occurence. he said he went home, pulled phone records, emails and even the chat messenger history (this is like 2004 or 2005 idk).

i'm not blaming myself, but, damn. little me saved my dad's ass from being used any longer by her.

note to self: dont ask too many questions.
insert big ""what the fuck"" here

tl;dr. by asking too many questions about my parents divorce and found out i'm the one who dimed my mom out for infidelity.

edit: this is a fuck up because i was apparently never supposed to know - hence my mom not wanting to talk about it and my dad being hesitant on telling me.

edit 2: super fuck up. i'm learning more and more about their marriage i never needed to know from other family. i was the ""save the marriage"" baby

edit 3: wow. i didnt realise how many other people have gone through finding out this kind of stuff later in life. kudos to all of you for learning from the example!

edit 4: holy shit! i've learned a lot from all of you! this blew up and i've made a few decisions:
-i am never getting married
-i think it's time to cut off my mom
-dont ask questions about your parents failed marriage - 

edit 5: apparently, after the divorce, she wrote my grandmother a letter stating she didnt want to take care of children and wanted to ""live her life""

also, i didnt remember this occurence because i guess it didnt really stick out to me. my dad said he acted calm and acknowledged everything, like a normal convo. the events after i remember oh so vividly.

moral of this story: dont think your kids wont talk if you're cheating and do not bring them around your kids. actually, just dont cheat 🤦‍♀️ easier said than done but damn!

also, please note, i didnt have to throw any paper for my mom to be a ho!

final edit: thanks to everyone for sharing their stories similar to mine and acknowledging that, for the children, the divorce was never their fault! these conversations have really got me thinking about how toxic for me it is to talk to my mom. i'll update in a bit. thanks guys and keep your head up if you fuck up!",4
"ontario i discovered that the door code ""0000"" lets people into my house. landlord doesn't want to change it.. i've lived in my current house for 6 months now, and both the front and back doors have electronic locks like this one(https://images.homedepot-static.com/productimages/6d9dae78-5757-4577-b105-60d54f773e09/svn/schlage-electronic-deadbolts-be365-cam-619-64_1000.jpg). i set it to a random combination at the start of my tenancy, but today i discovered the code ""0000"" has worked this entire time. i am obviously disgruntled, but sent him a polite email explaining my concern. i got this text back:

    the door lock code that you somehow stumbled into is 1 or 3 codes in that door i change it every year and a half and use that one. so don't worry nobody else put it in

    if you ever run into something like that again where you randomly find a code which you shouldn't. just tell me politely and don't announce it to everybody else. why are you even pressing the number zero? i intentionally chose numbers that were not part of your code so something like this wouldn't happen. next time just press schlage simbol button on to if you restart.

"by reading a reddit post and learning that i am not normal.. so today i woke up at 5 a.m. (about an hour ago). i open reddit before i start getting ready for work. i notice a post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) it has a lot of upvotes, so i figure it must be a good one.  

as i'm reading through the post and comments, i realize that have never been able to visualize something or someone. i only see black.  i did not realize that this is not normal. apparently it's called aphantasia and it's relatively rare. most people see clear images and colors when they're visualizing something. i'm 22 and did not know this was a thing until i read that post.  i've been trying to test myself for the last hour to see if i can ""picture"" anything. turns out i can't. so now i'm sitting here having an existential crisis about all the things i'll never be able to ""see"" again.  

tl;dr i read a reddit post and discovered i have aphantasia.


edit: a lot of people are asking if i can dream or not.  the answer is sort of.  i do have dreams occasionally and supplements (melatonin/other sleep pills) sometimes make them more vivid, but i don't recall them at all. the only time i know i have dreamt is when it's a shocking/scary/exciting dream. i feel something after i wake up, i just can't recall a damn thing that happened. sometimes i can remember the premise of the dream, like if it was me working or traveling somewhere, just can't ""see"" what i saw when i dreamt.  i think i dream maybe once or twice a month.

edit 2:  i understand the difference between visualizing and actually seeing something. *seeing* is just the best word i have to describe what i can't do in my head.  from memory, i can tell you what something looks like. i just can't *see* it in my minds eye.   

while reading a book, the descriptions do nothing for me.  i read for the plot.",4
"by having sex with an upset stomach nsfw. this happened today. my husband will probably find this and laugh, so if so, hey babe! 

earlier today my husband and i began to fool around; i've had a somewhat upset stomach for the past few days but i thought i'd gotten past the worst of it. evidently, i had not. 

as my husband and i got closer to finishing i felt a pressure in my bowels but decided to keep going because what was the worst that could happen? once we finished i felt a sort of ""pressure"" by my butthole and went to feel only to stick my finger in poo. i had literally orgasmed so hard that i shit, and on my husbands balls too. all i could utter was a simple ""oh no""

my husband immediately figured out what had happened and started laughing; i was a mixture of laughter and tears of embarrassment, but he just comforted me and was gleeful in that now he could claim he ""actually fucked the shit out of me."" i'm lucky to have someone who gives that little a shit (no pun intended). 

tl;dr: had sex and pooped on my husband

*update: i avoided this for 3 days to see if my husband found it. though there are people claiming in the comments they're him, they are not lmao. also, no, we're not getting divorced! he's still making jokes about it so i think we're good.*",4
"daily use of the art of upod (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. tell your s.o. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.. under-promise, over-deliver (upod).  not new advice, i know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    these are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an m.d. ph.d. in neuroscience/neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, i under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).  

1.) realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). people often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them. 

2.) upod only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  you shouldn't tell your so that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.

3.)  **don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  if you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to ""offer"" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  this is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody's fault but your own.  first of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over upod with them again.  many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually opud (over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  you might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).  

4.) when starting out, **buffer upod with ""i wish"" statements**.  i have 4 kids, and with my m.d. ph.d. training, i literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  at the beginning of each school year, i remind my kids that although i wish i could make it to every event, i will not be able to attend everything. every time i show up, my kids are totally stoked.  i sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know i can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, i have found quite the opposite.  i have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that i say i will be at. 

5.) when employing upod, **focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  for instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with ""i really wish i could go, but i probably can't.  could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?""   when a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know ""i will check with the chef to see if i can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  however, i can bring you some free extra breadsticks that i can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.""   

6.)  **you can maintain an optimistic attitude while still upod-ing to yourself**.  i just realized that upod-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  i used to always tell myself that i would get more work/homework done over christmas vacation.  turns out, i was always disappointed at how much i actually got done.  now, before the break, i tell myself i will be happy to get 10 or so hours' worth of work done each vacation period. if i get more done, i am pretty proud of myself.   for instance, even though i spent about an hour putting this post together, i am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  this is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success i have, it is worth it (also, i plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).   

7.) **under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  teach them, in gentle ways, how to upod. 

8.) **in some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are upod-ing**.  example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a friday evening).  i say ""some instances"" because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  for example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  for instance, you don't need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.  

i apologize if this felt like a lecture, i just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before i had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, i am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of upod.

tl;dr:  under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.

edit:  the driving example was  probably a terrible one, just the first one that came to my mind.  my wife is a very patient person, this was just the first example that came to my mind (my wife usually just wants to know when i am home and if they should start dinner with me wait a bit).  she is my rock.  i have also supported her in her career goals and am supporting her through school right now as well!  i am very thankful when she upod to me as well.

"for not taking pictures of my wife at our wedding?. so we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'i do', 'sarah' and i would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. it was her idea and i thought it would be fun. 

fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. we look through them together for the first time- to summarise:

her photos: me in my suit, me with our god daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. more of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

my photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

as soon as sarah saw the pictures i had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. i asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that i hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. i basically told her that i didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. she replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. this conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. i feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, i need to know if i'm in the wrong.

so, am i the asshole here? i... feel like she's overreacting a little. i thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. i didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.

**edit: info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. the cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. i remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. she prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**

**edit 2** i'm the asshole. and a clueless idiot. from now on i'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. thank you to all who have judged me, i accept my judgement",3
"my aunt and older brother fell in a river 36 hours ago. the numbness brought on by the entire ordeal is indescribable. my household is in turmoil, and in the midst of it i don't know where my new course of life leads.


over the weekend my aunt and older brother decided to travel together to medellin. they had both talked about the planned trip for a long time, and were both super psyched. our last communications were a number of photos my brother sent to my mom of them at a forested park area. the last photo was received at 1pm approximately.  we wouldn't hear anything of them for the next 24 hours.


the sunday i returned from picking up groceries to find her in hysterics with the phone clutched to her chest. she was muttering that they fell in a river. now, knowing my mother i just assumed she was being a bit fatalistic, she gets like that at times. to this day, despite working at my job for a year she never fails to tell me to ""stay safe and don't do anything dangerous"". this time though, there was more, the tears, the shaking, this time was different. after pressing her for more details she gave me the full story as recounted by the third person traveling with them.


the trio had just gotten done *exploring a river after a hike* outside a little town called cocorna. my aunt, brother and a co-worker of my aunts had gone for a swim with about 3 others. *close to the end of the swim it seemed sudden weather had set in causing the river to begin to swell. the three other bathers managed to exit the water before the surge came bursting down, but my aunt, brother and the third individual were caught in the swell. all three were washed downstream. my aunt's coworker was found 2 or so hours later downstream clinging to an outcropping in the surging river for dear life.* 


my aunt's body was found downriver the next morning. my brother still can't be found. no one knows how to feel right now. thank you for reading.",11
"by making my gf watch walruses die.. yeah, (last night) royally.  i was watching the making of  ""our planet"" last night and got about 50 mins into it and paused to let my gf in my apartment.  if you haven't seen it, i highly recommend it!  incredible behind the scene documentation of how the videographers set up shots, traveled to exotic locations, survived in insane climates...ending with an unannounced scene of walruses falling to their deaths from a fucking **80 meter cliff**.

my girlfriend comes in, we start cuddling on the couch, resume the doc, and then really sad music starts playing out of nowhere...  i have never seen this documentary before and everything else leading up to it was wholesome af, so this was a little alarming.  before you know it, these god damn walruses are tumbling down giant cliffs because who the fuck knows.  even the camera crew was like ""why are they climbing so high?!""  for god's sake, the footage was in super slow motion and we can clearly see these poor animals' skulls and tusks cracking with every tumble with their bodies curling over one another into a dead walrus stock pile.  it was truly awful and heartbreaking to watch.

my gf immediately separates herself from me, tears silently streaming down her face and says ""i'm going to bed""; it all happened so fast.  she was upstairs crying and i'm staring at a screen filled with dead fucking walruses while camermen and biologists continue crying on screen.  guilt welled up in me because it was my idea to continue watching when she arrived.  it didn't help that she made it clear she is extremely sensitive to any sort of animal death early on in our relationship.

i went upstairs and cuddled up next to her while apologizing.  she understood and wasn't mad at me, although i still felt like a jerk.  before you know it, we were back to laughing and making jokes after a few minutes, so all was well.  we made a deal to never watch any wild life documentaries together ever again (bless you, sir david attenborough).  funny enough, we made plans to go to the zoo on saturday earlier in the week.  avoiding the walrus exhibit at all costs.

edit:  reminder that we were watching the making of the documentary.  a bunch of y'all missed that part in the beginning.

edit part 2: apparently some believe all zoos are evil and are comparable to animals getting their heads bashed in by a rock.  interesting.

edit part 3: i appreciate all of the love and hilarious comments!  and then there is some of y'all that take this internet thing waaaay too seriously.  yikes!

***tl;dr***  i accidentally made my girlfriend cry by watching walruses fall from an 80 meter cliff.  we are going to a zoo on saturday and are avoiding the walrus exhibit.  sir david attenborough is a universal treasure.

"for expecting my daughter to help her brother?. me (50sm)

my daughter (32/f)

my son (27/m)

i love my kids equally.  

my daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  we don't charge her rent and so she's built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

my son is a bit more aimless.  he has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  he supports them (gf doesn't work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  they have lived in airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  there's no way he'll be able to pay that off on his current job.  he has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it's going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  the debt will inevitably grow with interest.  my wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

i don't want my son to file for bankruptcy.  it would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  i believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  when i pass all my children will have is each other.  they should learn how to rely on each other more.  

i told my daughter i think she should loan son the money.  she got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.

"by climbing 999 steps with empty pockets.. quick disclaimer: this was a year ago.

i'm a huge history nerd and i absolutely love exploring ancient sites. my mother and i took a trip to greece and were on a tourbus.

one of our many stops were nafplio (which was absolutely beautiful) and our tour guide said ""if you climb 999 steps, you'll find the beautiful fortress of paladimi. the entire bus chuckled (mainly middle aged, few elders.) but being the teenage self i am, i was determined to climb those steps.

there's a slight problem however, i was really out of shape.

i am at the beginning of the staircase up the mountain and my mom (bless her heart) offered to take my wallet and the hotel keys so it wouldn't weigh me down. left me with just my phone. she decided she didn't want to join me on my hike up the mountain because (understandably) she was worn out.

i begin my ascent, around 15-30 excruciatingly painful minutes later, i make it to the top. i had a sense of pride as i stepped to the entrance of the gate. i would be able to see a part of greece that the rest of my tour bus wasn't able to see. i would have stories to tell at the dinner table. i would have amazing pictures.

suddenly, right at the door i see a sign.

""8 euros for admission"" 

and with that, i took my walk of defeat back down the 999 steps.

"opening a joint account with my s.o. was the best financial decision i've ever made. about two years ago, my significant other and i were serious enough to open a joint savings account together. i am not great with money, and i tend to spend anything i get. often, i spend any extra money on paying off student loans, but that doesn't negate the fact that my personal accounts frequently hover close to zero. 

with one joint account, we each deposit a set amount every pay cycle. that money cannot be touched for anything besides the already budgeted necessities like rent, groceries and the electric bill. 

because we deposit slightly more than we actually need, in a relatively short time we built up the account and now both have easy access to roughly $2000 in case of emergency. 

i would never have been able to do this alone, but knowing it's our money as opposed to my money means i leave it where it is. i would only use it in a real emergency.

"t-mobile made a mistake and billed me for a month after i cancelled. they agreed it was a mistake and said they'd fix it. i just got a mail from a collections agency saying i can settle that t-mobile bill. i saw my credit score was hit hard by this as well.. so last year i cancelled my t-mobile plan. i went into the store and paid everything i owed up to the end of the billing cycle. i had no phones to be paid off, just the service bill. i paid it off and cancelled my service and they agreed i wouldn't get any more bills since i paid off my current cycle.

well the following month i got a full bill as if my subscription was never cancelled. i called into customer service and after a while of arguing with different reps they finally agreed that yes they did make a mistake and it was taken care of.

throwaway account as i am an avid redditor. i have been contemplating writing this out because i feel like that action alone could offer me some much needed introspection. i will try not to drag on but i apologize if i do.

i (41m) have always considered myself comfortable with who i have grown to be, i have worked hard in life, have a 4 year degree, a great career, financial stability, loving friends, wonderful family. in many ways i have done well for myself, however, in terms of love, i am missing my mark. i have been single for about 7 years, prior to that i have dated my fair share, never was engaged or married, but i've had long term relationships, weekend flings and everything in between. following my last relationship i decided to take a break from the dating scene and work on my career goals. so far, it's paid off, jumping 2 promotions in 7 years. i have felt unfulfilled in that department, but i was surprised how easily i could go 7 years without missing dating or companionship. i just simply don't miss it much.

a friend invited me out for beers and darts a few weeks ago. we usually go to the same little pub, where we know most of the normal faces. it's not uncommon for us to mix with the people playing at the board next to us. this night was no different, 2 guys set up on the board next to ours, we made small talk with them here and there, one of the men said his goodbyes and left, the other guy stayed behind and shot darts by himself, we offered him (lets call him james) a place on our board and shot some games of cut throat. things got fun, we drank quite a bit and we were having a lot of fun. my friend said he was ready to take off but james and i were having a good time so we decided to stay a bit longer.

my friend took off, james and i had a couple more rounds, we had quite a bit in common and it felt like i was hanging out with an old friend. he told me he had a rec room with a pool table and dart boards at his house with a built in bar. he showed me a few pictures of the room and i was thoroughly impressed. he suggested we go hangout there and i was on board. since neither of us drove to the bar, we caught an uber to his house which was only a few minutes away. we shot a few games of pool and chatted about more personal stuff, our past relationships, careers, college, upbringing, etc. james is a lot like me, never married and a career-minded guy. things sort of took a turn in conversation when james asked me about my sexuality. he asked if i ever had a phase or experimented. i sort of laughed a bit and said no no, that wasn't something i'd ever done. he made one or two small remarks about it in jest and that was it. about another hour past and i told him i was taking off, we exchanged numbers and agreed to hangout again the following weekend, foregoing the bar and hanging out at his place to cook out on the grill.

i get home, off to bed, i get a text from him asking if i made it home safe, i didn't think too much into it but i did tell him i got home safe. the next day, sunday. i got up and did my normal sunday shuffle-off-the-saturday-night-booze of going  on a jog, hitting my favorite lunch spot and recovering the rest of the day on the couch. about 3p i get a text from james asking if i was interested in coming over around 6p, he was going to grill some fish up and have a couple friends over. i thought that would be fun, so i went. we had another good time, this time i only stayed a couple hours and when i got there he told me his two friends cancelled so it would just be us. it wasn't a huge deal, he was good company. i took off around 9p. he sent me a text about 10 minutes after leaving saying he had fun and is looking forward to the weekend plans we made. i texted him back that i was looking forward to it as well.

the following day james sent me a text telling me about something funny that happened to him at work that morning, i don't keep my phone on me during work so i didn't see it until lunch time. i feel like it's important to note, i don't text people throughout the day, i guess i'm sort of old school but i don't chit chat with people via text often, so to me, james is reaching out more than i'm used to friends doing, but i didn't mind. i looked forward to talking to him. after work i went to the gym per usual and home. i saw someone who kinda looked like him, it made me think of him. on one of the tvs in front of the treadmills they were showing a tv show we talked about, it made me think of him. at the grocery store picking up dinner stuff, i walked past the seafood section and it made me think of him.

we texted throughout the week, i even started keeping my phone at my desk so i could text him. this isn't like me at all. finally saturday comes around and plans go off like normal, i actually got to his place a couple hours early. he suggested i invite my friend i was with when we met (well call him mark), i did and mark came along with me. we all had a terrific time, james cooked for us, we had plenty to eat and drink, spent time in the pool, shot darts, it was a blast. the end of the night comes around, mark said he wanted to take off and again, i felt the urge to stay and hangout longer. which is exactly what i did. this time we sat on his pool deck until 2 am talking about everything you could imagine. i realized the time and had to take off, he understood and instead of shaking hands he hugged me, this is not usual for me whatsoever, but it felt so naturally acceptable, like i wanted him to do it. i left and this time i texted him from my uber telling him that i'll let him know when i arrive safely.

that was a week ago, we didn't hangout this past weekend but we've texted daily and made plans to go hiking this coming saturday. i thought about the way i feel about him and i've concluded it's the same way you feel when you meet someone who you fall in love with. coupling that with his questioning me if i've ever fooled around with guys or had an 'experimental phase' kind of makes me think he feels the way i do and he may be gay or at least bi-sexual. i'm torn as far as what to do, because i love this feeling and i think i'm falling in love with this guy. it feels so strange to type that out but i think it's true. he is definitely flirting with me and i have decided i am definitely flirting back with him. should i have a talk with him directly about this? should i make a move on him? what if i do and it feels wrong? i have so many questions and i don't even know where to begin. has anybody had this sort of thing happen? is the reason i had no qualms with being single for so long because i lost interest in women subconsciously?  i have never outwardly been attracted to guys, but this isn't an attraction to a person physicality, this is deeper than that, which is why it's really screwing with me. sorry i rambled a lot, but just typing this has been therapeutic. thank you for reading.

"i'm a guy and i had to fake an orgasm for the first time in my life last night. i've been talking to this girl i met from bumble. first date went well and we ended up having sex and i slept over her place. we had been talking for this last week and i've been getting the feeling she's too into this for how short this time span has been so i tried to give her a chance by meeting up for lunch a couple times and sleeping over again last night.

so last night happens and it's going alright. we talk, watch a movie, it gets late, and i'm tired. she doesn't seem like she wants to have sex as she plainly states ""it's so late and i'm too tired to do it"", so i say ""fine with me"" and lay down to just sleep. she won't stop bothering me about how she doesn't want to go to sleep and keeps asking what i expected to happen tonight and won't take my suggestion we just watch another movie until we both fall asleep. it was crazy annoying and it put into perspective what type of person she is and that we're not on the same wavelength. 

i don't really thirst for sex so just spending time with her was fine but i did bring condoms which she asked why i brought. she keeps bothering me after i tell her i'm just trying to get sleep since she doesn't want to watch a movie until we fall asleep or have sex. she says that she wanted sex the whole time and she was just speaking her mind earlier. i told her she should have just been straight up and told me that's what she wanted. so we get down to business, and i'm thinking to myself ""i'm not into this at all"" but she was enjoying it. there was no way i was going to cum so i just did that final long thrust, twitched my dick a couple of times, and made some satisfied sounds. i thought i was going to get some good sleep, i was wrong though. 

it only gets worse from there but that part of this story is still unfolding this morning and i feel like i've said enough already.

because his car accident required xrays, the hospital shared my (the wrong persons) information with this third party radiology group.

the hospital has fixed the mistake and is no longer coming after me for payments, but the radiology group is refusing to fix it saying that the information they have is correct and i am on the hook for it. they sent me his medical information, what he had done, etc. they refuse to call the hospital to find out and the hospital is refusing to call them to tell them.

is there some sort of easy-button i can press here? i'm not ducking out on debt, i am literally saying ""wrong person, fix your stuff"" and getting nowhere. pretty sure they are going to send this to collections if i don't do something soon. i refuse to pay for someone elses accident and i do not want my records mingled with this other ""dan harris"" - to put it bluntly it would be very bad if our records were mixed.

"if i buy my girlfriend a cheap engagement ring?. i guess it goes without saying that i am proposing, but i should mention my girlfriend doesn't know i will be. i picked out a ring i think she'll like. she never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. so i found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. she loves green and gold jewellery, and i spent a long time finding this one. it's a created emerald which i think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

the ring is cheap. it was £300 and has actually gone down to £180. i mentioned this to my sister who said i was a dick, essentially. apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. she says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. i'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

i could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. i certainly wouldn't know why i'm paying more, i don't think she would either. however, i am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new tv for £250. i kind of realised i'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and i started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. so wibta?

"sallie mae has raised my interest rate to a ludicrous rate and are not informing me why and are straight up ignoring my questions. i need advice on how to battle this or some good loan consolidation options.. i'll keep this short and sweet (or bitter rather).

as the title states, sallie mae recently raised my interest rate to 10.75%, my loan amount is 28k. i have called them multiple times and have tried to get it lowered to no avail.

what are my options? currently i'm paying $250 in interest alone every month and my total monthly payment is around $360. i've been paying around $500 each month to try and chip away at it faster but i realize that it would be a lot faster if i also reconsolidated this loan and also paid 500 every month.

what are some good loan reconsolidating options? i've tried my bank but they don't offer student loan reconsolidating options anymore. i've gone to my parents since they have excellent credit and asked them if they could reconsolidate it for me by taking a personal loan (they could probably get a rate of 3-4% with their credit) and i would just pay them every month instead of sallie mae but they shut that idea down and are not willing to help.

what can i do? any help/criticism would be greatly appreciated and i can provide some additional info if needed.

edit: to further clarify, i know i signed up for variable rate but was told as long as i make the monthly payments on time they wouldn't raise the rate on me (if that's wrong i understand, that's just what i had been told)

for the past 1.5 years i have been making the minimum plus an extra 150-200 dollars, but my interest rate has increased by 3.5 points.

edit 2 from what i've learned  before i go to sleep:

1. always choose fixed rate over variable
2. shop around for rates instead of sticking to one financial institution
3. interest rates can fluctuate for various external reasons (hence always choosing fixed rate)
4. the people of reddit are very helpful! 

thanks everyone!",10
damn girl are you a newspaper?. because there's a new issue with you every fucking day,0
"i 21 f hid my daughter from her father 21 m, my ex, with help from his mom. 4 years ago, i dated a guy for 2 years. we were really in love, best friends, all of that. we broke up after a nasty fight my sophomore year of college that was fueled from our frustrations of being long distance. his mother detested me because her husband had died a few years back and he was her only son, and i guess she thought i wasn't good enough. she always made this very clear, and one of the issues my ex and i had was him not noticing or defending me.

a couple of years ago, my ex came to our hometown and all my old friends met up. we were mutually surprised to see each other, and it was very clearly an odd and tense situation. everyone got drunk, ex started talking to me, then we were laughing, then we started making out and had sex in our friend's guest room. super drunk, no condom. i barely remembered when i woke up and just dipped out of there.

a month later i'm still pretty messed up because i still loved him and that encounter made it worse, and i realize i'm late on my period but hadn't noticed because i had been so distraught. took a test, so surprised when it was positive i fainted. i knew we wouldn't work out as a couple, no matter how much i still loved him. i wanted the best for him- i wanted him to find a girl to be happy himself with and finish school and be successful (he was really going places) and not have to move back home to be with his kid. i loved him so much i just wanted the best. couldn't bring myself to get an abortion. so after three months when it really hit me that i probably wasn't going to lose it, i did what i thought was the best thing to do. i went to his mom.

his mom was very wary opening the door. faked a smile all that, tried to politely ask what i was doing there. i told her i was pregnant with her son's kid, and that we wanted the same thing for him. i told her i wouldn't get an abortion, but ex didn't have to know. she was real quiet, asked why i was willing to do this. i said i couldn't tell him because i didn't want to get back in a relationship knowing he wasn't happy with his life, and i didn't want to fuck it up. so i told her i wanted to move away to detroit, where some of my extended family was, and cut everyone except immediate family from back home off. that i wanted to basically drop off the grid, delete everything, disappear and raise my kid. so we made a deal. she would pay child support and rent (she is very wealthy and was very willing to keep this secret) and i would continue to go to school. i remember the last thing she told me was ""thank you for doing what's best for my son. i never knew you loved him this much."" really fucks to think about now.

i went home and cried, then eventually broke the news to my parents and my plan. they were absolutely against it, so i promised to stay long enough for the birth, but i had to leave after, this was my life. i think part of the reason my dad allowed it was because i would be living off campus and they wouldn't have to pay rent, and it would be a lot less money for them. my mom only allowed because she visited her family in detroit often and she always thought my ex didn't treat me right (that wasn't quite true, though)

flash forward and i have left school, i'm at home, social media accounts deleted, number changed. my mom keeps getting calls from my friends and tells them i have decided to start life over (the worst part was hearing some of my close friends cry, even the guys) and i couldn't ever answer the door because sometimes my friends would try to see me. my parents always said i wasn't at home/moved away. 

after the birth of my daughter i stayed for a month then moved to detroit. started working part time, took classes online, raised my kid alone. shit sucked but i made friends who didn't know me before and life was okay.

that leads to yesterday. at around 3pm i got a knock on my door, and see 6 of my old friends including my ex. i was supposed to have company over so i had actual clothes on and the apartment clean, thank god. i tried shutting the door but boy 1 stopped it and they forced themselves in. said girl 1 had been going to my parents mailbox for weeks to try and find where i was (mailing address). they found a letter i had sent my parents with pictures i had developed of my daughter (but they didn't open it, just used the address) and came. thought i was part of a cult or sick or something. boy 2 mentions a rumor that i had a kid. standing there and seeing my old best friends and the shock and knowing i was fucked just killed me and i started tearing up. cue my daughter waddling into view behind me.

i wouldn't tell them who the father was, but my ex had the strangest look like he knew. they all sat down and i brought them beers and then played with my daughter. they all seem so young now, or maybe i feel old. my daughter went up to my ex at one point, and held her hands up to be held. she hugged his neck tightly and wouldn't let go, then sat down facing him and fell asleep against his chest. my ex looked at me and i had to turn around. thought i would lose it.

later we all caught up. ex became exactly what he wanted, so maybe this was worth it. i explained i had wanted a new life for me and her, and i missed them all so much. it was late so i had ex carry her to her crib to sleep. while it was him and i in there he finally asked if she was his. i burst into tears and he knew. he was so angry, and i tried my best to explain but obviously it wasn't enough. i told him i thought it was best for him, and his mom agreed, and he started crying. i think from his yells the others knew too.

they all slept over and are still here. my ex wants to work something out. i still love him but i won't get back with him just so he can see his daughter. i told him he can visit whenever he wants, but he wants me to move to his school's area. i don't know what to do. and i'm sorry. i thought i was making the right choice and it was selfless, but now i don't know. any advice would help. 

edit: my ex and i had a scare early in our relationship and he acted poorly. kept asking me to abort it etc. he was immature then and part of the reason we broke up was because it always felt like he wasn't growing up. i didn't stay in a relationship with him/get back into one with him after finding out because it would just be him angry at me all the time for something i didn't do and bitterness towards me for ruining his life. that being said, he seems really different now. i think he might still be in love with me, and i am still in love with him, especially after seeing him with my daughter, however i won't get back into a relationship with him if our daughter is the only reason we are together and i know he doesn't truly want to be with me for me. i know it's still fucked up, but i don't think he would have been able to become successful or grow up if he had known. not saying what i did was right, just that that was my reasoning. thank you.

edit: wow, thank you so much for the gold. i don't deserve it but i appreciate it and all the support and advice and honesty, even if it was hard to read. thank you everyone

update: well, it's been about two and a half weeks since i wrote this post. my ex and my friends all left the day after but my ex went back to his moms place and had a talk with her. he apologized to me for not being the most supportive before and was still upset with me, however understood because he has seen how much he has grown. he was livid with his mom  and if she didn't have a stake on where my daughter and i currently live he said he would cut her off immediately. i am done with cutting people off so i wouldn't have let that happen regardless. i got to go home last week, and met up with a bunch of people. a lot of tears, didn't expect that, and my friends threw me a surprise coming home party. it was very overwhelming but mostly because i never knew i was so loved. my daughter seems so happy with her father and i'm in love with their relationship. my ex and i went out to dinner a few days ago just us two and although we didn't call it a date, it kinda felt like the ones we would go on as kids. that same connection is there, my goodness it's crazy. like i breathe differently with him or something. he's so much more mature now it's insane, and i feel different too. it's all been so refreshing. he even walked me to my parents door at the end of the night and kissed me on my forehead for a moment before going to his car, which is exactly what he did on our first date as teenagers. sent my stomach into flutters and everything. i'm not saying we will end up together as a couple, but it feels like that's a possibility. even if we don't he has been a fantastic father so far and definitely will be kept in my daughters life no matter what. we've met up with his mom and my parents and talked everything through. i finished out my fall semester at school and now i'm going to be spending a few months in my ex's city and weekends at home while i apply to other places closer to him. this was agreed upon because i feel it's only right for me to move closer to him after depriving him of the beginning of our daughter's life. me, my ex, my parents, and his mother are splitting financials until i finish school. everything is kinda unstable and feels weird right now, but at the same time everything feels very right. maybe it feels unsettled because i'm not used to being this content and happy? like i'm afraid something will go wrong? i don't know. maybe i did make a mistake back then, but i cant bring myself to regret anything, especially when my ex is so understanding which tells me he knows he wouldn't have been a positive person in my daughter's life before. i don't know, i think everything will be okay. money is fine, school is continuing, my kid and her father are spending so much time together, i get to see old friends again, and my ex and i are reconnecting. i can't ask for anything else and i'm so grateful. god is so good. i never deserved any of this but i'll take it gladly. finally, thank you for all your comments. i promise i read them all but it was very hard to respond in a decent amount of time with everything going on. the advice helped more than you all know, and all the comments were taken into consideration. god bless you all, and merry christmas/ happy holidays :)",12

"for mentioning that i had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor?. i'm posting this from my wife's account and both perspectives are included. i, the husband, am asking if i'm the asshole. 

this is a topic we've been debating for the past almost two years now. it'd be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

my perspective (husband):

my wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. over the prior couple months i had started developing an intermittent toothache. about two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, i probably ate something delicious. 

after eating something delicious, i can't quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. i'm talking sharp, eye-watering pain. her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  i didn't want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

once they arrived, to my surprise i was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. that with a couple excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife's contractions started to pick up. 

am i the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

wife's perspective:

my husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. it kept getting worse, and every time he'd complain i'd say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

so as he mentioned, as i was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. granted i wasn't in terrible pain, but for a few hours while i was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

i did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but i had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment i felt i should be focusing on. 

i'd like to also mention it wasn't just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. 

he is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?",3
"f23 found out that my m29 boyfriend only settled for me and is not really attracted to me.. saw his text messages open and i did pry and when i catched a glimpse of ""break up with her"" (his friend wrote that), i couldn't help but read the entire conversation.

my boyfriend, who is 29, and has been with me for a year, is my first relationship and i'm his first as well. the difference between us, he's been looking for a girlfriend all through his 20s, while i wasn't too bothered/didn't care for guys much. (busy with college, not much interest, not much need). 

he literally wrote to his friend that he trapped in the relationship. that he wishes he could just hook up and flirt with other girls but he also wrote he always gets rejected and has no chance.

then he wrote how he would like to be with ""hot girls"" or even just date a hot girl and how he feels like he settled for an average girl.

i am insanely mad.

honestly, being realistic, i'm a bit above average (my face is about 70th percentile realistically speaking and my body is quite fit/skinny), whereas, as sexy as i find him, is a bit unconventional looking/overweight. probably average guy by us standards, but he is, (not in my eyes!), not someone who should complain.

although, i do believe everyone has the right to be with who they are attracted to. i like chunky guys, others do not. so i don't get why he is with me when i'm not attractive to him and i'm just straight up disappointed.

besides, his need for hook ups - i don't get it. i'm more enthusiastic about sex than he is, i initiate it, and i would have it more often if he were willing to. 

what made me lose my sh*t is that he thinks he only ""settled"" for me.

i get the impression he's only with me so he won't die alone.

what should i do?",7

"by letting my boyfriend pull out. this is a throwaway for obvious reasons, even though this story takes place almost 15 years ago. 

i was new to having sexual relations with boys, as previously it was only ever my girlfriends who i explored with sexually before boys. so i didn't have a whole lot to go on as i didn't have regular internet access to view porn or search sexual questions. 

so anyway, my boyfriend and i are getting busy in his basement bedroom. i'm smart enough to be on the pill, and also we had both just gotten tested for stds before starting to go further in our relationship. because of these clean tests we decide to bareback the sexy times and he opt to pull out as well, just in case.

he aims and blows his load on my stomach. except we can't find it to clean it up.  we looked everywhere and could not find his little splat of spunk. then we hear the front door unlock and open and the sound of his younger siblings and parents. we quickly get dressed, i spray myself with body spray (good old calgon) and head upstairs to pretend like we didn't just bang. 

i've only met his parents a couple times, and they are pretty easy going, especially as they let us sleep over in the same room. i have an uncommon female name and i'm often misnamed. so she reaches in for a hug and doesn't bother with my name, and then points out that i have a wet spot on my t-shirt. 

i have always had large enough breasts that i cannot see my tummy by just looking down. i have to lift my shirt. well stupid me forgets the fiasco moments ago and i lift my shirt slightly to investigate this wet spot. shining in the afternoon sun, is a long snot like string of jizz attached to my shirt from within my belly button.  his mum gives me this look and says i must have dropped my hair product or something and leaves it at that. i think i've gotten away with it. 

after dinner sometime as we are putting away dishes, she takes me aside and hands me a wad of condoms. not a word is said, just a handful of condoms. 

now i occasionally see her walking in the mall and make awkward eye contact with her and she gives a weird smile. i know the only thing she thinks when she sees me is ""bellybutton full of cum""


tldr: boyfriend pulled out and lost his load somewhere, but don't worry, his mum found it for me. 

edit: front page and rip inbox. i just woke up so i'll find a ruler for the belly button picture.

"my fiancee of 10 years left me at the altar. she packed her bags and ghosted me. i just want to die.. i can't do it. i just can't. i have no idea what i did wrong but, i clearly i did do something. i've been dating her for 10 years and known her since i was a kid. we had moved in together, we were soulmates.  i waited so long to get married because, i made a promise i would be in a stable position at my job so we could start a family. i did everything i could for her. 

we were to be married 2 weeks ago. i was at the altar waiting for her. she never came. she disappeared. her family knew and didn't say a thing. they all watched as i waited for her to come. when they found her gone, everyone looked at me. can you imagine the shame, the humiliation i felt at that moment? i cried, i fucking broke down and cried like a baby in my dads arms.

i went home and she had already gone. she had clearly planned this in advance. everything was gone. no note, no nothing. her family weren't talking to us either. they cut us out. they were in on it. they always hated me. they always said i wasn't good enough for her...

i can't get over it. i can't. i was supposed to be on my honeymoon this week. i was supposed to be having the time of my life with my wife. now i'm sleeping alone in the dark. i've been drinkin all day, everyday. i just want the pain to stop. i can't go on like this.

i loved her, i loved her for more then anything. she was my life, my best friend. i don't know what to do but,i just cant go on it hurts too bad.",11
"by buying a house that wasn't attached to the sewer and discovering this fact while crawling through my own plops nsfw. obligatory this was a while ago.

so it's a known fact amongst friends and family that i always have a poop or fart joke waiting to go. it's just who i am. you can have your turgid penis and voluptuous vagina jokes, i'll take a heaving helping of poop jokes with a squelching mound of fart stories any day of the week. if you've shat your pants in public i want to know, the more public and embarrassing the better, it's not a sex thing i swear; i've just always been like that since i was a young child. there is something inherently humorous to a subject so personal and private and that will never change. 

that knowledge combined with the events i am about to relay to you make me wonder if perhaps we do live in a world where unseen forces act to maximize the comedic value of my life.

some don't believe me when i tell them this tale but there's a link at the end with video evidence so suspend your disbelief and prepare to be grateful for your moderate home repair issues, it could be far worse.
here we go.

my wife and i bought the house with a few minor problems that were handled during closing like all deals are, we knew there would be a few surprises from what friends and family said so we stashed some money aside and opened a home depot card for the promotional no interest purchases. 

sure enough the floor wasn't insulted in the downstairs and since the crawlspace was hard to get around in to the inspector never caught it. i went ahead and purchased a load of insulation to re-insulate, whatever. it was summer and after getting married a few months earlier then moving we were exhausted so we worked on the interior of the house and the yard for the remainder of the good weather.

during this time we'd get the occasional whiff of something stanky but didn't think much of it. i'd buy some draino and the smell would go away. ok, the house has some plumbing issues, no biggie, $7 a week until we got the rest of the home under control and we'd get a plumber in to take look.
it's the week before thanksgiving and i finally get under the house to work on that insulation. it's cooler and everything is drying out for the winter. 

i've been in some crawl spaces that would gross the average human out before but this place, jesus fucking christ this place took the cake, blew a load all over it, force-fed it to a drugged out former child actor then bottled the shit they produced for resale at the local farmer's market as a skin care product it was so evil. i knew right then we were in for a ride, the house had been flipped and if it wasn't visible during a tour it had not been fixed.

that week i found 2 dead cats, an old stereo system from the 80s that had been hulk smashed, a car wheel, a broken window for a bar from new hampshire (we're in new york) and so much insulation it took fifteen extra large trash bags to remove among other random debris. even with a respirator my nose still get clogged and i spend the remainder of the day with no sense of smell.

anyone who knows anything about homes will tell you when someone flips a house they tend to buy shitholes and plug them with some spackel to keep the streams of festering shit at bay before selling them to unsuspecting dupes like us. 

if you're buying a home that's been flipped negotiate like you're fucking the shit out of a fresh coconut that will be thrown away immediately like any normal person would because i guarantee you that those sellers have been hiding cum filled coconuts in the walls just waiting for you to find as you settle in and attempt to make changes to the home. they don't give a fuck if the place falls apart next year because the reality of real estate law is it's buyer beware. they deserve to make as little as fucking possible for their ""trouble"" so go in fucking if you want to come out satisfied. then again i'm biased as you will come to find out.

so i'm under the house two days before thanksgiving and hauling bags of old insulation out through a tiny hole i can barely fit through. my wife tells me she's going to take a shower and won't be able to help if i need anything. i crawl back under and figure i'll grab another bag or two and call it quits.

then i hear the water. if you're a homeowner the worst sound you can hear is water running where it shouldn't be. that's better than never hearing the water but it still means there's a lot of water where it shouldn't be any and if you don't find it things get messy fast.i didn't know much but i knew that.

i hear a splattering that is roughly equivalent of a shower running but it sounds like water is pouring into a pool. i've owned a home for less than 4 months at this point so everything makes me nervous but this struck fear in my heart. it's even coming from the corner of the crawlspace the inspector couldn't get to because of ductwork making this urgent andsuper inconvenient.

i'm about 100 pounds lighter than the inspector so i squirm my way over the main sewer line and over the field of nasty old insulation that would still take another ten bags to remove. clouds of fiberglass cat piss dust are billowing and making it hard to see through my respirator. i wriggle under the main return air duct just barely making, something shifts and the fucker slides about 3 inches closer to the ground making a return from this side of the crawlsapce impossible. i sigh and keep going. my nose is always clogged from the moment i get down there, something about that dust just immediately makes it impossible for me to smell anything for a good couple of hours even though i make sure the respirator fits snugly against my face.

the light of my headlamp illuminates the problem, there's a stream of water pouring from somewhere between the joists. i think to myself ""great! the pipe broke?!"" and crawl forward to the sparkling stream. i climb over a mound and down the other side onto what i thought was dirt but the moment i touched it the layer of dirt on the water rippled with the water beneath it. i see the brown ripples spreading but it's too late and the cool water floods into my gloves, moments later i realize my entire torso is wet as the water soaks through my jumpsuit. ""what the fuck!?"" this is more than a single shower. this is, like a month of showers in a dusty lake under our house. the water stops running and i decide it's time to just get out of the crawlspace and call the plumber. we put away money specifically for stuff like this, it won't be fun but whatever.

i'm moister than an oyster at this point and take a soggy second to look over the tangle of pipes and mountains of dirt - weird the floor should be flat but whatever - searching for a path to where there's a space behind the furnace i'll be able to slide through. i see it and start slogging through the sludgy mud trying to figure out what it's going to cost to drain this water so the plumber can work. 

the i hear it. a toilet flush. it didn't hit me until it hit me, the better part of a flush splattered across my back unleashing a sub-human scream of disgust and outrage. i turned back to try to see where it's coming from and respirator caught on a random old pipe sticking out of the ground sliding to the side. 

a whiff of unadulterated corruption made it to my clogged crawlspace dust filled sinuses. jesus, buddha, sagan, anyone with temporal admin rights wind this horror story back and get me out of here. send me back to the womb, let me start over, i want to start over; we have to go back, kate!
i'm sure you're thinking ""why the fuck would my wife shit after showering?"" i thought same thing, to be honest i don't know, she married me; i livestream jars of meat for my own personal entertainment, i guess she's going to be a little off, too.

the realization of how far up shit's creek i am soaked into my brain at the same speed of that which soaked into my back. the upstairs bathroom wasn't on the tax documents prior to the seller's ownership, it was part of the renovation. someone fucked up bigly and since the house wasn't occupied after the renovation this is only now coming to light. holy shit i'm crawling through three months of shit, my shit, my wife's shit, my father in law's shit! 

memories of every shit i'd taken since moving in coursed through a mind imploding with revulsion like some nightmarish montage complete with the disembodied image of some arch nemesis cackling in the corner of the vision. we had numerous taco nights, i had discovered a sale on discount hot dogs a month earlier and had an entirely unrelated case of food poisoning a week after that was so bad i was showering instead of wiping. all of that was down here, with me, on me, soaking into me.

the panic set in and i scrambled up and over the mound that when it broke under my frantic grasping revealed yet-to-decompose toilet paper and slimy fecal matter complete with a visible kernel of corn, the metaphorical cherry on top of this unholy shit-cake that i was scrambling through.

five minutes later my wife comes downstairs and finds me in the downstairs shower, which was also not attached to the sewer, crying hysterically, the stress of finding one thing after another leading up to me crawling through my own waste had been too much. i could only hope that in time the stains burned into my memory would fade.

today we joke about it because what the fuck else can you do? we had it fixed, we moved on. we still can't believe we never smelled it bad enough to think more than a backed up drain. we started taking classes on how to repair your own home and are learning as much about basic home repair as we can. we are wiser and more capable today, this kind of disaster won't happen again.

to answer your questions yes we had an inspector and no new york state does not hold inspectors liable for anything but after several other far more expensive issues and discovery of discrepancies in the sale documents an attorney has taken the case.

tl;dr i bought a house where the sellers had not attached the pipes to the sewer and the crawlspace prevented the inspector from catching it. i learned about this 3 months after the sale while crawling through the puddle of poops. ",4
"i (24f) met my new flatmate (26m) yesterday and we had sex within an hour of meeting. don't know what to do. hi. please don't judge me!

i'm not the kind of girl that usually does this. i've only slept with 5 people, all relationships. i've never even had a one night stand.

(edit: fuck what i said above, judge me all you like, and yes i am that kind of girl now watcha gone do) 

i live in a 4 bed house, and we had a room spare. yesterday the new flatmate moved in. i wasn't in when he arrived but when i got back from work, he was in the kitchen making food. the second that i walked in, i don't know how or why or what happened but the sexual tension was just ridiculous. even just from seeing the back of his head i felt something weird.

we spoke for a few minutes, introduced ourselves etc. but it felt like we were really comfortable with each other already and we were getting along so well. there's no point me going into all the details i am literally just blown away by what happened and i guess typing it is helping me come to terms with it. there's so much sexual tension between us that i want to brag about it haha.

so we started talking about a new tv series and i invited him to watch it in my room, as i'd just put on the next episode. he accepted, and soon were stoned in bed watching tv and then we just made eye contact at like an awkward sex scene and then suddenly we're kissing.

it was crazy, i wasn't even thinking, i wasn't making sense of anything around me, i just wanted to have sex with him. he's sooo ridiculously like my type but extra somehow. i wish i could explain it. literally if anyone can tell me what sexual tension is scientifically, eli5, pleaseeee.

anyway, we had sex for maybe half an hour and then we heard another flatmate come home and my mum called me, so he just went to his room. i saw him a couple hours later going to the bathroom and he just winked at me and said 'can't believe we just did that' and i just said 'yeah crazy...' 

wtf do i do now

i fancy him so much

the sex was great

but he's my flatmate and it's all awkward and weird 

and i stalked his instagram and he doesn't upload regularly but it looks like he had a girlfriend pretty recently. i can only assume (well pray) that they are in fact broken up.

lord how do i survive in this house, is it safe to keep having sex with him? because i want to... can i just knock on his door and ask if he wants to do it again?


edit: some of these comments are insane haha. i don't feel bad about it. do i normally do that kind of thing? no. am i that kind of girl now? yeah i guess i am, who cares. you can judge me if you want to :)

edit 2: i used protection. i'm aware that he may not want to do it again and that we may not be soulmates. that is a-okay, there's no pressure on him. he can do what he wants and so can i. maybe he does have a girlfriend; i'm not responsible for that, i didn't cheat on anyone, and if i find out he does have a girlfriend, i'll tell her. this event does not define me as a person or make me less of a person. grow up it's 2019 and people be shaggin",7
"by quoting a kid's movie at the end of sex.. this happened around 5 years ago when i was still in university. 

i was not the most forthcoming 5 years ago, i didn't know how to 'be' around women, let alone, god forbid, have sex with said women. 

as surprising as it may seem then, i was going through quite the 'dry spell' that year, and had resigned myself to studying instead and little else. 

however, as with all things in life, the moment you stop you looking is the moment you find it. 

i found myself back at this girl's house who was studying in the uk for that year. she was from slovenia (somewhat unimportant detail other than those brits who voted 'leave' and now see me as part of the eu problem somehow) and absolutely gorgeous. i was punching way, way above my weight and thought i should relish every one of the seconds i knew i was going to enjoy with this girl. 

again, unsurprisingly, i did not quite go the distance. i was however, in a state of absolute delirium - that post-orgasm 'fuzz' where everything in the world seems grand, and nothing could take that away.

apart from me, of course. 

she, rightly so, tried to, y'know, get me going again, for my first attempt was so poor. 

however, in my state of delirium, and ultimately recovery, i was in no fit state to do so just yet. 

as she goes to sit atop of me, my brain goes into a strange autopilot. 

i gently push her to the side to stop her sitting down on me. ok, that's bad enough, but it didn't stop there.

i, for entirely unknown reasons say the words 'that'll do pig, that'll do'. in exactly the same way as that immortal final line from the kid's movie called 'babe' (about a pig, funnily enough). 

as it transpires, this movie was not a hit in slovenia, and no amount of me pleading 'it's a kid's movie' at her seemed to help as she slowly got dressed and opened the door for me. 

tldr: ended a dry spell with a knockout girl, refused round two by calling her a farmyard animal.

edit 1 - thanks for the gold. you've taken my gold virginity, in fact. that'll do, pig, that'll do. 

edit 2 - to all those all knowing sex gods on reddit telling me that sex doesn't end at the male orgasm. yeah, thanks guys, i know. i was in a state of bewilderment. i just needed a moment. i had plans. but then i fucked up. hence why it's here on tifu. who woulda thought it or thunk it?",4

"my wife has cancer and i miss sex with her so much. i feel bad that i miss physical intimacy. remorse
my wife has stage 3 breast cancer and is a year out from chemo ending. by all indications chemo and radiation was a success and she is working her way back to having a normal life.  she is 49 and we have two gorgeous children and a wonderful family.i love her so much. i am very blessed to have her in my life and have her love. unfortunately the side affects of of the drugs she is on is that it is inducing menopause . she has absolutely no libido anymore and is struggling with body image problems (scars on her breasts), weight gain and tiredness. 

adding to all of this is that before she came down with cancer i cheated on her and we actually separated before trying to come back together and work it out. i have worked on my issues and  trying to regain her trust as much as possible. it has been three years since everything blew up. i screwed up and made a lot of mistakes and vow never to let myself go that route again but with all that is happening i find my mind wandering to porn and this other woman.   i know she worries about me leaving again and i have tried to show her in every possible way that i am committed to being there.  i have been in counseling for years working and we have just started marriage counseling again. i never imagined i would cheat on my wife and am completely blown away that i did. i screwed up. i own it. 

i miss having sex. i miss going to bed after sex. i miss falling asleep with her on me. our kids are older now and i was so looking forward to having an empty house and waking up on sundays to have sex without worrying about the kids. note that sex has always been difficult for us to talk about and communicate our needs around. it has gotten so much worse now. anyways  i feel like i am going sideways and feel ourselves drifting apart like we did when i cheated. i am trying to right the ship and pull together but i am so tired of trying to fix what i feel is broken. 

it has been almost six months since we had sex. i have taken up smoking pot and working out like a mad man to induce the same relaxation and physical exertion. better than the alternative but my wife doesn't approve of my smoking pot and worries that i am getting in too good of shape :)  i love when she holds my hand and she falls asleep on me and i love holding her hands. sometimes that is enough for me but i miss my wife. 

cancer sucks..


thanks for listening


edit - so thank you everyone for all your comments. righteous indignation and empathy mixed with bewilderment and sadness. this is life. it is messy sometimes and no one is perfect  - including myself - and including all of you - internet strangers. as i mentioned in another post this is the trifecta isn't it.. cancer - sex and infidelity. let me say this. my wife has been out of chemo for a year. my relationship with this other woman ended 3 years ago. i moved back in and after a year she came down with cancer. i have not spoken to this other women since i moved back in. she has contacted me and i asked her to leave me alone which she has but i have seen her creeping on me a bit online and it has played games with my head and caused me to think about her more often that i want.  do i think about this other woman ? sure. i felt i loved her at the time.  this was the confession. do i think about what my wife is going through. every single day. 

regarding the sex  -i have not had sex due to the cancer with my wife for 6 months. prior to that it had been about a year due to the chemo. prior to the cheating we rarely had sex and had grown very distant after raising our kids. we rarely went to bed together and i felt lonely and went out looking for something.  it was always very difficult for us. more to the point though it isn't about nutting to me. it was perhaps when i had the affair but i have realized very resoundingly that what i was searching for before wasn't sex - but rather intimacy. i have found myself happy when i can hold my wife, or have her head fall asleep on me. i want more though. i want her to reach for me and to seek me out. i don't think that is selfish - but rather human nature. i need that and want that with my wife. 

so at the moment am i happy? most definitely yes. is our marriage better now than it was before? resounding yes. it is a work in progress. i have been seeing a counselor working on my shit for the past 3 years and i have been requesting/pleading and begging my wife to go. she doesn't like counseling and it is hard for her to open up but i am happy that she has agreed to go and i intend to try to get things better in the intimacy area. i am happy and blessed with my family and every day am thankful that i have her to wake up to. she is the most amazing strong woman that i have ever seen. she handled the affair with such grace that i cannot express how amazing she is. my mother died of breast cancer and died alone (with me and my sister there) after my father cheated on her. so this hits home for me that i would/could do the same to my wife. 

am i happy that i am married? yes. it is the most amazing and difficult thing but when a couple can work past some shit instead of throwing it out -  it is pretty amazing. that internet strangers - is what life is about . i cherish that.

"i stopped and picked up a man and his pregnant wife on a rainy night in seattle in 1977. i just figured out that i may be able to find out how this story ended after all these years. i was southbound on i5 on a week night in the early autumn of 1977. rain was pouring down and the interstate was awash. i was driving an orange, 1973 bmw tii when i saw a crazy man in the middle of i5 jumping up and down and waving his arms. i slowed down and stopped about 300 yards away from his stalled car. he ran up to my window and shouted ""my wife and i were going to the hospital, she is in labor and i ran out of gas can you take us the rest of the way!!!?"" he jumped in the back seat and i backed up along i5 in the dark, in the rain about 300 yards. i got out and helped his wife into the car. boy was she pissed! she was so pregnant that she could no longer bend at the waist. she put down her pillow and slowly got in. the guy sat in the back and fucking yammered the whole way to the hospital. we got to the hospital and the women of the family closed around her and, in the arms and the care of other women, she vanished into the sliding doors of the hospital.
i was left alone and forgotten under the porte-cochère with the rain still falling in sheets.
so if you were born on a rainy week night in the early fall of 1977 in seattle and your idiot father ran out of gas on i5 taking your mom to the hospital i am the dashing stranger who got you the last few miles into the care of your family. you are 38 now and i am nearly 70. i have wondered about you a lot over the years. i almost feel like you are, in a small way, one of my own. i would love to know how this story ended.",11

"i think my 12yo daughter is being groomed online (wa state). my 12yo daughter got introduced to discord (a chat app) by a friend. she has since been involved in some pretty explicit sexual role play with what i can only assume are grown men. we have blocked all her access to the internet at home. she's given out our home number in the past, the town we live in, and her full name. she has recently been given a cell phone so that she can reach me during the day while i'm at work, and recently she's given  (at least) of these men her cell number and i've discovered some pretty gnarly messages. 

i've done a reverse phone look up and this particular guy seems to be in ontario. 

he has told her that he is 18. i'm willing to bet he's older.

 she needs to be scared straight and this guy needs to know he's talking to a child. 

my husband says we need to call the police. 

i don't even know where to start. 

can someone point me in the right direction. i'll be bringing it up to her therapist in the morning. 

edit

she has a therapist, thank you.  she is well supported at home, encouraged, etc.  thank you, also, for all the parenting advice in a legal advice sub.  that was unexpected but not surprising.  this kid is well supported at home, cared for, encouraged, and supported in any way imaginable.  she's never been spanked, rarely yelled at, etc.  we are not permissive but neither are we oppressive.  she went down the anime path, which turned into the furry path, which escalated to the bdsm/role play sex chat that she's currently engaged in and i'm not even sure she knows what some of these things are she's talking about with these men.  i'm thinking she should watch the cyntoia brown documentary.  i've gone through her discord chat history and it looks like she's telling people we abuse her, her dad is horrible, and that she's alone all the time (which, for the record, is by choice because i literally try to include her in everything), all kinds of drama.  

her phone is a basic flip-phone with no data plan. no apps.  i'm going to contact her school this morning and get her chromebook access revoked. 
 
the family computer is in my bedroom now and is under lock and key when i'm out.  

the wifi is locked down so most devices attached are ""asleep"" except for specific circumstances.

second update

i spoke with our county sheriff.  unless she told them her age explicitly, they won't do anything.  i connected with a guy using her discord account and he eventually told me he thought she was 16.  he's clearly done this before, as 16 is a threshhold age.  

i also found evidence that she has been camming with him and sending him very explicit video which she has, of course, deleted.  ",2

if you admit to raping someone, you need to be held accountable for it, even if you're a girl.

"my sister asked my to plan her gender reveal.. my sister (technically step sister but whatever) found out that she's pregnant about a week ago and is like 11 weeks along, i was the only person who is actually excited because our parents already have four grandchildren. anyways. yesterday i was hanging out with my sister and her boyfriend when they told me that they decided that they want me to do the gender reveal for them. they said that i'm the one person that they trust enough to not tell anyone and to actually make it cool. 

them telling me this almost made me emotional because none of my other sisters have ever involved me at all with their babies or pregnancies, and i've been told so many times that i'm untrust worthy and can't keep my mouth shut. 

in short i'm just so happy that they trust me and chose me to do this for them.",11
"we're calling off the wedding. last night my fiance and i sat down and had a frank conversation. 
things have been going really poorly for our relationship lately. we've spent lots of nights fighting over catering and budgets, who to invite and leave off the guest list. at one point we were screaming over the color of tablecloths. our couples therapist is making bank right now over the increase of our visits. 

finally last night we both had enough. we sat across the table from one another and decided to call the whole thing off. fuck the deposit and the linens, and my future mother-in-law's wishes. fuck it all. what a crock of shit. 

last night we called it off. last night we also spontaneously bought tickets to scotland. we're going to secretly elope to the isle of skye. i feel like a huge burden has been lifted from both of our shoulders.   ",11
"single dad w/ 4 kids, live with family for help with kids. my kids mother never contributed, but passed a few weeks ago, we now qualify for about $1k a month in social security.. i've posted numerous times and have always received great advice, so i want to say thank you in advance. so 2 years ago i separated with my wife and moved back to my home town with my mother/sister/grandparents because i needed help with my kids. i was unemployed and incredibly depressed, i took a job making $13 an hour, and i received a couple of raises and promotions for working hard and what not. last may after a bunch of great advice from this sub i'm now making close to $50k a year (with over time).  because we live with family we don't have many living expenses, and over the last 2 years i've paid off over 25k of debt, my credit score went from 590 to 720, and my only remaining debt are my federal student loans. my emergency fund is at about 3 months, and i have over 10k in credit cards if ever needed. to be honest i've been spending money kinda frivolously because i was going through a divorce and now because she passed away (retail therapy i guess). 

because of her passing we'll now receive about 1k a month in survivor benefits, and i don't know how to plan for that. i could very quickly save up to buy a house right now, but i don't know if that should be a priority because to be honest i still need help with my children, and there are so many other living expenses i'd absorb. also we currently live in a suburb and i don't know if i could afford to live in the area and keep my kids in the same school. part of me feel like i should just leave that money separate and start college funds for all my kids. also i'm 33 and don't have much saved for retirement. my 401k isn't even a year old and i'm only contributing 5% a month.

sorry for another update so soon, not good news. i'm an idiot. 

last night i called one of the numbers provided to me and spoke to one of the employee assistance people, who assured me that they'd get back to me.

i had a short shift this morning, and he came in right at the start, which he often does. i bought a mini spiral notebook at the dollar store and recorded the time and exactly what he said/did as someone told me to do a few minutes after he left when there was a lull in people coming in, and my manager came and saw and asked me what i was doing. he didn't press me or anything but i was dumb and told him what was happening and that i was just recording it ""just in case"" (again i've already told him about that customer and he basically ignored the problem and told me to do that too). he didn't comment on it at the time beyond saying ""oh"".

i woke up from a nap less than an hour ago and just checked my texts and he sent me a text telling me not to come into work tomorrow and that my services wouldn't be needed anymore. i'm freaking the hell out. i won't be able to find another part-time job that fits my schedule, i won't be able to move out of this fucking town. i feel like i'm going to puke. i'm so pissed at that dude and my manager and myself for not doing the notebook later. 

i was told to edit this to formally add a question or i wouldn't receive advice? i mean, just what's the best thing to do from here. thought it was obvious i meant that, sorry. thanks.

"if i stopped inviting my triggered friend to movie night?. tdlr at the bottom

every couple of weeks me (f24) and my friends get together for a ""classic movie night"" at my house. we drink, joke around, and watch old movies deemed to be ""important to film"". good times.

the problem: one friend (23f) has been through an awful trauma recently which has affected her profoundly. our group has really huddled around her to make sure she is okay and lend our support any way we can... but... in the last few times we got together she got triggered by the graphic scenes in the films we were watching and politely asks that we stop. (the first time was rosemary's baby and the second was taxi driver, if that matters.)

of course we all wanted to be sensitive so both times we immedietly turned it off and the group quickly dispersed after (kind of a bummer). independantly, friends from the group have asked that i not invite her the next time, because we want to watch clockwork orange which will definetly be triggering to her. since i'm hosting, it is up to me, but since i usually invite everyone via a group chat that she is in, it would require some maneuvering to exclude her.

god i feel like such a dick but my friends and i really want to be free to watch what we want without worrying about making her uncomfortable. if i went out of my way to not invite her?

tldr: my friends and i want to watch movies that our traumatized friend may find triggering - to just not invite her anymore?

edit: wow. so it took just 45min for me to realize im an asshole! some smart commenter posted an obvious solution: i will be using https://www.unconsentingmedia.org/ from now on to vet our films before movie night.

"my wife's mother tickles our son inappropriately and my wife defends her - help?. hi everyone. i am a 35m married to a 27f. 

we have a 2 year old son. ever since i can remember, my wife's mother has tickled him. usually in normal places but also in places where it shouldn't be okay to tickle someone. 

i recently read something that women can actually be child molesters too but it's often overlooked because people give them more leeway and ignore all the signs.

and when i thought about it, i realized that exactly described this scenario. if this were her father or my own father then this would definitely not be tolerated ever!

but the fact that it's my mother in law... who is mother to... my wife... makes it complicated.

i recently called me wife out on it for the nth time and she came back with ""you have a sick mind to think that my mom would ever molest a child - in fact youre the deranged one because you're sexualizing it!""

i actually felt guilty because i felt like maybe i was the one viewing it that way and maybe it is my fault for seeing something that's not there and overreacting.

while my son doesn't seem to have a problem with it, i wonder what example that it's setting for him about boundaries and touching. what if he starts tickling other boys or even girls down there because he learned it from her?

what happens if it progresses into more?

idk what to do and i'm honestly hurt that my wife is trying to gaslight me about my concerns.",7
"for dancing well at a wedding?. background: my sister and i have never gotten along. i don't know why, i wish i did so i could fix it but so it goes. i had invited her to come country dancing with me every time i was home, but she never wanted to go.

my date for the wedding was my swing dance partner. we tore up the floor all night long. any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. we were having a blast which was great because i really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom). my dance partner asked my sister if she wanted to dance at least three times, she declined, and danced quite a few times with the maid of honor who doesn't swing dance, but can sure follow a lead and killed it!

a few members of my family have told me that my dancing at the wedding was inappropriate and i should have toned it down. they have even gone so far as to tell me that i hired a professional dancer to be my date (he isn't... i met him jr year of college when we started dancing weekly together at a bar)

so my question is, am i the asshole for dancing like i know how to dance or should i have dialed it back a but for the wedding?

edit: just so it's not hidden in the comments because it's been the center of why most think i'm the asshole, we were doing aerials, not every song, but they were there. 

i've seen some follow up with thank yous and such on the posts, but since this is my first timing posting i'm not sure when to do that. thanks everyone, you all are right, i didn't think that i had done anything wrong coming into this, but wanted to get the crowd opinion. it seems like popular vote is i made an ass of myself. i just wanted to say thanks for the perspective check. you all gave me some stuff to think about. i had never heard the etiquette rules about aerials either, so that's good to know now too. i always thought that was just a bar rule.",3
"i scared and confused a man at whole foods by fabricating a bizarre lie for no reason.. light

i've never confessed here before so if this sort of submission is frowned upon, please expunge this post with impunity.

**tldr**: i (seemed to) make a man doubt his own sanity and leave whole foods in a panic because of a little off-the-cuff storytelling. i feel bad about it.

this happened last night. conversation is paraphrased but largely word-by-word accurate, as i've been replaying it in my mind frequently since.

**brief backstory**: i'm a 20-something guy who does a little improv and a lot of dm-ing for a couple of d&d groups. i'm also blind in one eye and have amblyopia (said eye wanders occasionally). i try to live a good life guided by kindness and conscience, to various levels of success.

**the situation**: walking home from work, i get a call from my girlfriend. she is running late to a book club and frantically asks if i can pick her up some snacks from whole foods. she intends to do a drive-by in a lyft and pick up those snacks. she's very appreciative, and i happy to do it.

i grab a cart, do the rounds, buy her snacks, and get in line to checkout. directly behind me is an older man, maybe mid-fifties. we exchange pleasantries about the snow. i get a text from the girlfriend and hustle the snacks out to her. the lyft parks her a full block away, and with the snow, running them to her takes a few minutes.

here, i think to myself ""well i may as well not waste a trip"" and go back to the store to shop for my weekly groceries. i retrieve a second cart, and then i see him. the older man coming out of the adjacent (but separate) liquor store. he spots me in the stores' shared lobbies. i catch his gaze, and to my surprise, he approaches me.

**the incident**: with a curious smile on his face, the man asks, ""this will sound strange, but didn't i just see you checking out? can i ask why you're going back in with an empty cart?""

my initial instincts are an amused appreciation for his curiosity and an aching nuisance about explaining the situation in all its longwinded mundanity (as i've subjected you all to now). i'm tempted for a minute to simply explain, but something takes hold of me. like he who answers the call of the void, i begin to speak, only half in control of my actions.

i smile reassuringly and respond ""sir, your watch appears to be out of synch.""

he is still smiling his good-natured midwestern old guy smile, ""what?"" he puzzles.

""your watch."" i reiterate, still smiling myself. i lean in a bit. ""it appears to be out of synch."" i lean on those last words a bit coyly.

the man puzzles at me, and looks down at his watch, then back at me. ""what? didn't i just see you?""

i breathe a single-burst chuckle, ""of course sir. we've seen each other lots of times."" i leave my cart and walk a step toward him, lowering my voice. ""your watch. it *appears to be out of synch*.""

the man now is just staring with a furrowed brow. i want to stop. i think part of me thought he would just write me off as a loon and walk away. but something in his expression urged me to continue.

i continued in a light hush, ""sir, you ought not worry about this. we've had this conversation before. i suppose that we'll have it again. the airport? the dental clinic? maybe you remember these too--sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. i urge you to adjust your watch.""

the man, to his credit, scrunches into a frown here and parries. ""what in the hell are you talking about, my watch?""

i stare at him intently. ""think a moment sir. the time on the boats, perhaps. i'm the man with the bad eye. i know you noticed. you're the man with the old watch. haven't you seen me before, now that you think of it?""

his mouth opens a little bit, and he does seem to think a moment. against my expectation he begins to look genuinely scared. again, i want to stop but don't.

""we need to meet like this, from time to time. but it needn't be so distressing for you. your watch is fast, sir. set it back a few minutes. and don't dawdle. i'm already later than i ought to be.""

then i check my own watch. flinch into a frown, and press past him. i abandon my cart and head for the exit. ""see you next time,"" i call back, almost drowsily.

the man follows me out onto the sidewalk and calls out ""hey now, wait!"" there is obvious terror in his voice. but i keep walking with speed. my heart is racing and as i cross the street, the man disappears behind snow-swirl and bus traffic.

**my conscience**: i hope he has a story about a crazy person he met at whole foods. i fear he has a slow-building psychosis founded upon conspiracy.

"for excluding my blind friend from my wedding?. i have a friend, bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. he's quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he's a solid guy and he's good to spend time with. we met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. first year we lived together, and have stayed friends since i moved out. after the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. he's not completely without his sight so it's not like we didn't notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it's just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he's not allowed to drive or get his license. he's completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can't drive. he's always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he'd travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.


now my fiance and i have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. as is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and bobby received both. because i'm not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. we had a few people who missed the rsvp date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. the rsvp date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. 


background backgrounded. now for the potential assholery.


bobby also missed the rsvp date. he wasn't the only one i had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he's messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. the reason for his plus one is his eyesight. because he doesn't drive and he's not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. i flat out told him no, he's not inviting his mum as a plus one because we've already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she's welcome at the rest of the day. 
the hotel in reality doesn't need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there's no easy space to slot her in, and i don't want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. i now doubt whether he'll come, because i don't know if she's happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.


am i the asshole?




*edit:* a few things to update here. i've been chatting to the friend more. despite what you all think, i do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can't be put across in a post. the mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. and by the tone of bobbys message, it wasn't bobby asking for his mum to be there, but bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. ceremony and evening do is fine, and i told bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. i've since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that's on site.

additionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. it's either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can't/won't drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. the bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. it's only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and bobby has been invited to use them from the start.

to those saying he needs eyes for the evening. i'm not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if i am still an asshole. i'm saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn't need his mother there. there are plenty of college friends there, who he's seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. it's a group of friends and we've all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as i said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).

i can live with being judged an asshole, but felt there was more information available that was affecting my decision, that wasn't available to the jury.",3

"tifupdate by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital. hey everyone. this happened a few weeks ago but i haven't had time and just wanted to make sure everything had settled down before updating.

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvg72z/tifu_by_thinking_my_daughter_was_being_raped_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

in the original post i left out some details that caused a lot of confusion so i will clear those up now. when i went into the room i grabbed his shoulders and started screaming at him. he stood up and i pushed him down. i went over to my daughter to make sure she was okay and she was screaming that it was a fetish. her bf was unconscious and we sat there trying to wake him up. he woke up and was conscious but was shocked/confused. he was wearing his jeans with his wiener out while they were having sex and was also shirtless, so i wrapped a blanket around him to cover his genitals and upper body and helped him into the car. in the car he zipped himself up and i gave him my sweater to wear. i realize now how my original post might sound like i was driving him around unconscious but i would have called the ambulance and not tried driving him myself as this would've been life or death so i'm sorry this was misleading. hell, i probably wouldn't have been able to carry him to the car (i'm just a strong but average sized lady :p) anyways, since he was conscious at the hospital they just had a nurse check up on him but he had to wait to see a doctor so he was in the er for a while. 

the doctor did some scans and found that her bf (thankfully) didn't have any injuries. he said that most likely her bf fainted since he didn't hit anything on the way down and woke up shortly after. her bf has also fainted before (long story) so thankfully he was unconscious due to the fainting and not the actual knockout. 

after the doctor determined he didn't have any injuries i called his parents to tell them, and they decided they didn't need to make the long trip. my daughter's bf begged me not to tell them the specifics of what had happened so we kept it at that.

for my daughter, we had a conversation about her kink. she says she has a safe word and has never had to use it and her bf always takes care of her after sex to make sure she is okay and loved. i told her that i didn't want her to be afraid to have sex at home because it's a safe place and i don't want her to feel bad over this. i installed a lock on her door as a little ""i'm sorry"" gift. i think this is something i should have done a while ago to give her some privacy, and i'm glad i've got that covered now. i also vowed to never have any surprise visits again. 

for her bf i got him a card, some chocolate, and i paid for him to have a night at an airbnb with her so they could have a private night together.

customer b: had 15 credit cards, most had at least 2-5 over 30 days past due, a prior bankruptcy, a prior auto loss, a couple installment loans paid slow and they were currently 6 months past due on their mortgage. 

customer a: 389 fico

customer b: 708 fico 

both were trying to get a similar style car around 30k, it was affordable for both. one got approved the other did not. the 389 fico was approved, 708 rejected. 

customer a's fico was so low because in their specific circumstance their student loan counted 24 times. as a lender and someone with student loans myself i understand that most likely they just missed 1 total payment. 

i bring this up to make a point to stop worrying about what your fico number is, and instead worry about what makes up your credit. pay your major credit first: autos/mortgages. if you're going to be late on something, do it on something not detrimental to your finances (like a low interest student loan). have individual credit, don't rely on parents/partners credit cards to boost your score, we see it and know you do it, and don't try to cheat the system. there are tons of people like me who look at credit all day every day, we know what to look for and generally can play the game better than most. 

i say all this with the caveat that some banks have not gone away from using the fico as an end all be all. it's still important for determining rate tiers. however most are starting to learn the tricks. i would not be surprised if in the coming years a fico score becomes irrelevant. so instead of trying to inflate your score, just work on paying the important things on time every time.

"overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller. my girlfriend and i have been dating for almost 3 years. last night she had some friends over after she finished work. i work from home so i only left my office to be formal and say hello and continued working. it was easy to hear the conversations they were having eventhough my office is down the hall. i then heard my girlfriend mention that she would leave me for a taller man.her friends made a comment on how i was a lot shorter than her ex boyfriend. my gf responded:

""if only he was as tall as ex he'd be 10 times better, if i could find someone taller than him, i would.""

i guess i should mention my gf is barely 4'11 in shoes. i'm 5'9. the issue isn't the height, but the fact that she would leave me for something so trivial. i talked to her about it since and said she didn't mean anything by it, just that she always dated taller men. she has since apologized multiple times.

is this a red flag of any kind of things to come or is it just me over thinking?

update: i didn't feel the need to make an entire different post for the update so here it is:

i left early in the morning to make sure i wasn't making irrational choices. when i came back she was immideatly apolegetic, but i didn't want any more apologies. i talked to her about how little respect she had for me that she felt the need to make jokes at my expense. she started crying and begging not to break up and feeding me the standard bs people say when they don't want to break up.

to not bore you with the details, i broke it off. i lose nothing at this point. 

i should clarify something from my initial post. i get that people can joke around and it doesn't mean anything, but when i confronted her about she denied it and got very defensive. that's the part that got to me. the fact that she tried to cover it up before apologizing.

i read all the comments and thank you.",7
"dentist is suing me for $15,000 over a 1 star google review... update. original post 7 months ago : just got served with a lawsuit seeking $15,000 in damages for leaving a 1 star review(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8fbvya/just_got_served_with_a_lawsuit_seeking_15000_in/)

&#x200b;

i messed up and didn't take the biggest piece of advice given to me repeatedly on my previous post: ""get a lawyer"". i thought i could just respond to the lawsuit citing anti-slapp laws in ct, fax over the form and wait for the dismissal letter in the mail...

weeks ago, i discovered that they had not received my response and if it wasn't mailed on time it would be too late. i paid for overnight mail and it was received on time according to the person on the phone. weeks later i receive a letter with a date for my court ""hearing"".

i went to this hearing and thankfully the judge stopped my former boss and his lawyer (who also brought a new employee to testify??!?) mid testimony and asked me if i understood what was happening because ""normally the defendant doesn't show up for this.""

the judge kindly explained to me that i had already lost by default for not responding, and they were here to determine how much money i owe in damages. i pulled out a copy of my response, and the case was continued. today i filed the proper motion and paid a fine of $130 to re-open the case against me in the clerks office at the court house. i was told to wait for a response in the mail. i am also getting a lawyer if i can afford it.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i didn't get a lawyer and filed the paperwork myself. it wasn't received by the court in time and i lost by default. the judge stopped the hearing because it was obvious i came ready to defend myself even though i had already lost.  if you give a 1 star google review, run it by your attorney first.

"i pretended to be a girl online for years and not even irl friends knew.. after my mom died in 2005, i was desperately looking for a distraction, which i found in an oldschool mmo.

when creating a character, i figured i might aswell make it a chick since i have to look at it all day. people being very social and nice was very unexpected. a few weeks later fake facebook and instagram accounts followed.

i played that game for close to 7 years and made a dozen ""friends"" who i still have contact with to this day, who don't know i'm a guy and for some reason today i finally feel like it's been a shitty thing to do, but i just can't let them know.

"after his father died, bf(30m) revealed a devastating secret to me (25).. my boyfriend (30m) and i (25f) have been dating for 4 years, we met in school (i was in college; he was in grad school). we had a very loving and affectionate relationship, and there were no secrets between us...or so i thought. 

&#x200b;

when bf's father unexpectedly passed away from a heart attack a few weeks ago, i was there for bf as he and his mother coped (cooking, cleaning, etc, all the stuff they couldn't do as they grieved), i held bf as he cried, and attended the wake and service.

&#x200b;

when everything was over, bf told me he wanted to get married but he had to tell me the secret he was keeping, since he did not want to go into marriage with any secrets. the secret may seem small to some, but it was huge and devastating to me. 

&#x200b;

for the entire course of our four year relationship, my bf was meeting up with his ex-girlfriend once a month (or more--i have no way of knowing). he claims it was completely platonic, and they only met as friends, and he sees her a sister. 

but even if that is true (it might be or it might not be, i have no way to contact her and find out), he still hid this from me our entire relationship, so i feel like it is cheating, even if it wasn't physical cheating. 

&#x200b;

he admits that he was wrong, and tearfully apologized. i told him i could not forgive him and this was an extreme betrayal regardless if he cheated physically or just emotionally, and that it wasn't just being friends with his ex but hiding it. he promised not to do it again, and to make it up to me somehow, but i honestly have no idea how that is possible since nothing can erase the four years of lying. 

&#x200b;

as of that conversation, we haven't met up in person yet. but i do have stuff at his house and he has stuff at mine, so whether we breakup or stay together, i do have to face him again. 

&#x200b;

so what should i do? i know the easy answer is breakup. but this is the person i love more than anyone, the one i planned to spend my entire life with, and a grieving human being who just lost his father suddenly, at an early age.

&#x200b;

i truly love him and see that he is sorry, but i don't think i can ever forgive him. still, he is already really messed up due to his father dying and completely cutting him off might destroy him. even if i don't want to be with him anymore, i still want to be there for him after the loss of his father. but i am so heartbroken that i can barely get through the day without crying and having panic attacks.

"for asking my coworker why he's married?. (throwaway with names changed because i know a few of my coworkers use reddit.)

so there's this guy at my work, james, who makes derogatory jokes about his wife. any time his spouse comes up in conversation, he'll make one of those 'oh, my wife is such a nag, the old ball-and-chain, *women*, eh?' jokes.  he'll always say it with a big grin and then laugh, but he does it *constantly*.
  
and when i say constantly, i mean constantly.  in the three years i've worked with james, i've only heard him mention his wife without making a joke along those lines maybe three or four times.  it really gets on my nerves to hear him trash talk her all the time.  

today another coworker of ours said that he was making plans for his anniversary with his wife, and james butted in and said ""oh, yeah, mine's coming up soon, too.  i guess i need to do something or i'll never hear the end of it.""

and i kind of lost my temper and asked him ""if that's the way you feel why are you still married to her?!"" 

james kind of sputtered a bit that he was joking, and i told him that he always talks about being married like it's a burden, and that there comes a point when even the funniest jokes get old, and that his jokes about his wife haven't ever been funny.

it kind of went to an awkward silence until james left for the day.  some of my coworkers are glad i called him out on it, some of them think what i said went too far.

so here?  should i apologize to james tomorrow?",3

"for making my sil cry at her baby shower by suggesting we should stop exchanging gifts in the future?. i come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and i do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). we've always been very generous to his side of the family. gifts are very much both my husband and my ""love language"" and in my culture (chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. it also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. one concern of mine originally was to treat my husband's family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

last christmas, we had some weirdness over christmas day present opening. i had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for sil (husband's brother's wife). she googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later i overheard her make some joke about how she could pay ""half a mortgage payment.""  several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she's tired of us ""throwing our money"" in her and her husband's face, and christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. husband and i apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

this past saturday, i attended a baby shower for the same sil. it's the first gift giving occasion since christmas and i really wanted to do it carefully. i asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so i decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. near the end of the event, mil pulled me aside and said that sil felt like i was being spiteful to her for  christmas. i again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and i had written a check for the little one's college fund as well but didn't feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. then i scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. when i found sil by herself for a second i handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. she looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, ""we don't need your money.""

i kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that i was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. she started crying and i immediately left. i've been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how i ruined the baby shower ever since.

(eta for additional  context - my husband and his family are american and we live in the us. we are in our early/mid 30s, my bil is 28 and sil is 24 or 25.)

(eta2 - i realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. the throw was 320 pounds, which isn't quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. i purchased it for her during an business trip to scotland last year. it is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious "" designer"" brand, just an old scottish maker. it was intended to be good quality and last many years. if she hadn't looked it up i don't think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",3
"by accidentally emailing everybody in my dept a chapter of my pornographic harry potter fanfiction.. this happened 2 hours ago.

i was emailing a .txt containing the latest installment of my fanfiction to myself because i'd written it on my laptop and i wanted to edit it on my desktop.

but i typed in my work email by accident. it's extremely similar to my personal email, but my work email automatically forwards every incoming message to everyone in my department. didn't even think about it.

i've never actually gotten physically sick because of a mistake before. the panic has died down a little. i've begun to accept that this is my life now.

it's not even tame porn you guys.

i'm going to resign tomorrow, early in the morning, by means of a letter; leave my keys to the building in the envelope; and go back to get a different degree. i've been thinking about doing it for a while. guess i don't really have a choice now.

**tl;dr:** sent a chapter of my harry potter porn to my coworkers earlier today. going to resign in disgrace tomorrow.

**edit:** thank you guys for all the advice and reassurance you've offered. you have no idea how much i needed it. i feel a little more human now, but this thread has gotten away from me. 

i still plan on resigning. i liked my job, but my boss will hear about this one way or another and as much as i appreciate all of the lies you've suggested, i honestly can't lie to her. i'm a shitty shitty liar and she's a very sharp woman. i won't get fired, she'd never pay unemployment as long as she lived, but i can't hope to move up in this particular company after something like this, and my life could get very difficult where i'm at.

i intend to go back to school. it's what i've been wanting to do for a long time, but i never had the courage to move forward with it. fortunately the nearby college has a good nursing program and i'm taking steps to register for fall.

now if you'll excuse me i'm going to go lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.

**last edit:** i know there might be at most 3 people who see this but i felt the need to update. it's very anticlimactic.

i calmed down before going into work monday and decided not to resign right off the bat. i just walked in like everything was normal and tried not to look at anyone. i sent out an email stating that my personal account had been compromised, and to please delete any messages from my personal account, as they may contain viruses. i felt like a dumbass trying to lie, but nobody approached me or acted strangely all day. my boss didn't even speak to me.

these last few days have been the same. maybe they read it, maybe they didn't, i have no clue. my guess is ""no"" but that might just be wishful thinking. either way, my life is going on somehow - but i'm definitely never going to email myself porn again.

and for those of you who were curious, it was a hg x lm fic set 5 years after the last book, so no, there was no cp or any other kind of nonsense going on, just regular ol sex between adults, although one is much older than the other. so don't worry. the children are safe.",4
"people who write 'r*pe' instead of 'rape', or do something similar, aren't helping anyone.. i understand the intention here. people are trying to be considerate of others who have suffered trauma, and they want to avoid bringing up horrible memories for those individuals. nothing wrong with that. in fact, i applaud the sentiment.

however, the way they're going about it is entirely misguided. does anyone honestly think that not putting an 'a' in rape is going to shield someone who has experienced being sexually assaulted from dredging up their experiences? we all know what you're spelling. this goes for any word people do this with.

i think this is one of those cases where a good idea was taken hostage by people who care more about virtue signaling than actually helping the people in question. instead of typing r*pe, how about just being a considerate person in general, and if someone tells you they want to avoid a topic, be a decent human being and honor that request. don't do this silly harry potter 'word that must not be named' shit.

"for telling an infertile woman that ""fur babies don't count""?. alt account. ya boy done gone made a massive whoopsie. 

basically i 20m recently started a job where i have mostly female coworkers. amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. they go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. there is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. she refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so i assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. however, friday i asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which i get bc i love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. when she later complained again about not being invited to something i kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, i don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. obviously i feel *awful* now, i didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. still i'm saved a little by the fact that i didn't know, right?

"by finding out i've been accidentally dating and fucking my half-sister, after taking a 23andme dna test. (edit 2)proof:(https://i.imgur.com/z0zm9xi.png)

throwaway, obviously. i also made the same post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/af5eex/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) over at r/23andme.

i just found out a few hours ago and my girlfriend and i are currently a mental wreck. 

quick background

my girlfriend (i'll refer to her as sarah) and i have been dating for a little over than a year and our relationship has been going very well. we both happen to come from the same town and met each other in college after being introduced by a mutual friend of ours.

here's where the fu begins to unravel

last year for christmas, sarah decided to come over and stay with me at my apartment for the holidays. i also had decided not to go home for the holidays either. plus, all my other roommates were back home visiting family, so we had the whole place to ourselves. it was perfect. 

christmas day rolls around, and sarah had bought the both of us 23andme dna kits. the thing is, is that we were both conceived by in-vitro fertilization via sperm donors. both of our fathers were infertile so our parents had no choice. deep down, the both of us were hoping to find our biological fathers through the service.

fast forward less than a month later to today, and both of our results are in. sarah comes over to spend the weekend and we go through our results together on our laptops. we compare our ancestry and health reports and nothing seems off. i even found out i'm 2% native american. all was well until we arrived at the ""dna relatives"" section...

sarah tightly holds my hand and says ""i hope we both find our fathers"". then i open mine up....

at the top of my screen, i see sarah's name.... ""27% dna shared...half-sister..........""

sarah starts hysterically laughing and tells me to stop joking. 

i don't react to anything she says, and just stare at my screen in disbelief. 

i then abruptly grab her laptop and open up her ""dna relatives"" section. we see the same thing. my name at the top... ""27% dna shared...half-brother"" 

at this moment my brain just completely short-circuits.....

i've been having sex with my half-sister. holy fucking shit. wtf

my mind starts going a 100mph and i began hyperventilating, going into a state of shock. i can't even remember what sarah was doing at this time.

it's pretty self-explanatory by now, but for those of you who don't understand how we could be related, it turns out our moms were probably both fertilized by the same sperm sample. what are the fucking odds, right? the fact that we're from the same town certainly increased the odds but still. 
 
6 hours later, just typing this entire post makes my body shiver. there are no words i have to express what my mental state is now. to put it in simple words: i feel traumatized. part of me still won't stop thinking about how much i love sarah and then i realize our entire relationship was incest. i honestly feel disgusted standing in my own skin. i've even been contemplating suicide.

sarah and i haven't talked at all since going into shock. 

right as i'm finishing up this post, sarah has grabbed her stuff and left my apartment a few moments ago.

i'm probably not going to respond to any of your comments/questions for now and i honestly want to be left alone in the corner of my room. i really just needed a place to vent all this.

tl;dr: former gf and i are both sperm donor babies and come from the same town. we take a 23andme dna test and find out we're each other's half-sibling. meaning i've been having sex with my sister for over a year. turns out we both were conceived from the same sperm sample, go figure.

edit 2: rip inbox. thank you all so much for the support. i just logged back in and didn't really expect this post to blow up. last night was rough. sarah's friend/roommate called letting me know sarah was home. as of now, sarah and i still haven't talked. but after an night of thinking, i believe i've come to terms with what we've discovered. for those of you who still think this is fake (i honestly wish it was), here's a screenshot showing our shared dna (https://i.imgur.com/z0zm9xi.png).
i think the best way for sarah and i to heal is to go back home (our town) and see how this all began with our families. only then will we be able to accept the reality. i'll post more updates as things develop.  ",4

"update mother in law suing for grandparents rights. op post below

&#x200b;

so we have court 4/10 which is actually best case scenario as our house is now sold and we close early may. we passed this by our realtor whom we had supporting documentation of us moving back when we talked to her in may of 2018 stating we were going to move south. she is so awesome she wrote a letter stating we were moving prior to all this happening and got it notarized by the state.

this should be a slam dunk and the judge will likely ask why are you wasting my time? her reason for the requested visitation is ""she loves her grand kids very much and deserves to be apart of their life"" per the law she has no leg to stand on and this is not a valid reason she would be able to get visitation even if she does we are moving and i don't believe ny state can stop that. one last thing about this is the petition she filled out my sons birthday isn't even correct its off by 4 days.

court date is 4/10 will update once court is completed.

"my son used this account to write his last words before he took his own life.. i was advised to post this here, as it was removed from another page. i apologize if this is also the wrong place for this.

my son, who would have been 21 this month, hanged himself on december 24 2016. christmas eve. my baby boy. gone. there are no words to describe what it did to me, and what it did to the family. i went into his room midday expecting to find him still in bed. i found him hanging in the closet. two lives were destroyed that day. the neighbors called the police when they heard my screams. i could not leave my house for months and lost my job. my older children had to move back in to support me because i refused to go out or clean the house or even eat food. my life had lost all purpose and for a while it was over. with time and extensive therapy i am just barely functional again, but life has never felt so empty. not a moment goes by that i don't think of him. i spend countless hours every day thinking of how i could have changed it. i know i could have. 

my son was enrolled in a general health studies program at the local university. he didn't have an interest in health and didn't know what career he wanted to pursue, but i pushed him into it thinking it had the most potential for a successful career path and that he could develop an interest over time. he didn't do very well in his first year but he made it through with a few failed courses. in april 2016 he had finished the winter term of his second year. i asked him about his final grades. he kept telling me that he hadn't received them yet. i knew he had but i didn't push. the summer term was starting and we had agreed that he would take summer courses for the courses he had failed in first year. he told me that he had applied to them, and he also told me he had finally received his second term grades and that he had passed them all. i didn't know at the time that neither of those were true. it was all online so i never checked. if i did, i would have known that he had failed all five of his winter courses because he had stopped showing up to classes due to depression and he never applied to any summer courses. i found this out later in august when he broke down and admitted it all. i did not take it well. i was so upset that he had failed his program, that he lied to me so many times, and that he spent the entire summer pretending to go to class while doing other things. i called the school immediately and arranged an appointment with the faculty. i explained the situation to them and they agreed to let him reapply in the fall as a special student, and that if he did well in his remedial classes he would have a chance to continue his program where he left off. he didn't want to do it. he wanted to take a break from school and apply to a different program later. i refused. i forced him to go back. i knew he hated it and i made him do it anyway. i didn't do anything to treat his depression despite knowing about it. instead i used it as an excuse to get him back in the program he never wanted to be in. i made him feel trapped enough to take his own life and i can never forgive myself for that. 

going back into his room was the hardest thing i've ever had to do. one step inside and i had a breakdown. months passed. i tried again. breakdown. we had to keep it locked until we hired a cleaner to pack his things because i could not bare to look at anything that belonged to him. i was only able to enter once the room was completely empty with just a few boxes stacked in the corner. months later when i was home alone, i mustered the strength to open one of the boxes. sitting on top was his laptop. i opened it and found it unlocked. i told myself i shouldn't look through it. it would only ruin me again. but i had to. i had to know. maybe he saw something that made him want to do it. maybe he had messaged one of his friends, and maybe they said something to him. i just wanted to understand why. why he would feel so hopeless that he had to take his own life. i found mostly things that would be normal to find in a young person's browsing history. people's facebook profiles, assorted youtube videos, a whole world i never knew. there was a file folder compiling images from what i could tell was shows/comics/games that he liked. i've never seen any of it before. i never cared. another folder with images of my son with his friends from his high school. i didn't recognize any of them. i never bothered to ask. i found a video in his youtube history showcasing how to tie a noose. i had to stop there and weep until i had a migraine. then i went back. i found entries on kijiji. he was trying to sell his game consoles and games, which i later found out he spent his tuition to buy. i found a site called liveleak, where there were a lot of entries on videos of people dying on camera. i believe he was trying to prepare himself for what he was going to do to himself. then i found this site, reddit, and i noticed his account still logged in. this one. nothing could have prepared me for what i was about to find. months of grief counseling undone in an instant. i had the worst breakdown of my life. reading through everything he wrote in his last days tore my already scarred heart into a million shreds. he had reached out for help so many times. he felt so alone. he wrote that if he died i would only care about the money i wasted raising him. i thought i had felt the worst pain a person could feel until i read that. it was my fault. he felt so alone and hopeless in his last days. and i made him feel that way. i knew he wasn't happy but i made him go back. i killed him.

if only i could tell him now that it doesn't matter to me. that no school or degree was worth his life. that no matter what he did, i would love him no matter what. oh how i miss my sweet boy. my baby is gone and i will never be okay again.",11

"i became attractive and i'm a little bit in shock. puberty turned me into an attractive man and it's so fucking weird. through out my childhood, from primary school to high school and late teens, i was bullied quite frequently. i was laughed at, ignored and etc. had close to 0 attention from females, never had a gf, basically was a virgin till the age of 21.

in the past years i've became increasingly attractive, lost fat, gained muscle, went through puberty, my facial skin got better.
only in the past months i've started to realize how good looking i became, and holy shit it's so weird.

people treat me with more respect, women hit on me constantly, some people are even intimated by me. it's just so fucking sad to see reality as it is.

i am in shock on how looks plays such a huge fucking roll in our lives, i've noticed it especially when people let loose of their conscious and go drunk/high. and now, even i notice how i do it myself, i try to not do it but it's fucking wired into our brains. we're a bunch of animals with sex in mind all the fucking time.

i'm afraid that i'll become a douche due to my looks. i'm so fucking confused and weirded out. it also bums me out, cause now i'm not sure if women like me for my personality or for my looks.

"(wa) neighbor who took cringe pictures with my car ia threatening me for ""ruining his reputation"". y'all, the saga continues. i'm on mobile and don't know how to link my previous post but here's a summary: an idiotic neighbor kept taking pictures of and with my vehicle in our underground garage and posted them on social media claiming the car is his. 

i thought this dumbass needs a dose of online shaming so here's what i did. his social media accounts have a pretty high followership (10-12k) and as others suggested, he is indeed some kind of ""guru"" scammers. i don't really wanna say what type of scammer for privacy reasons (not that he deserves any). well, i only have twitter so i took it there. during his last photoshoot with my car, i took a few photos for evidence. i chose one of those pictures, tagged him in the tweet and wrote: ""i see his handle loves my car. that's cool but would be nice if he didn't try to brag about a car he doesn't own. this is him during one of the photoshoots in our shared garage."" 

of course, it didn't take long until 1) dude deleted all the pictures of my car and 2) contacted me to threaten a lawsuit for libel (?) if i don't apologize to him publicly for embarrassing him in front of his ""fans"" and delete said tweet. my ass was laughing so hard. i didn't reply which seemed to only piss him off even more because he was sending me angry emojis and curse words. i should also that my tweet gained traction and has around 120 replies and 300 rts (i'm getting famous too!). mostly, people are bashing him and saying what a retard he is. others started making fun of his other posts (eg ""i'm starting to doubt he actually ate at that restaurant. probably just took a picture and left""). moreover, this scammer apparently claimed on social media that he lives on a mansion on lake washington and some of the commenters put two and two together and realized that he is actually my neighbor and there is no mansion. 

this dude basically says that it is my fault that all these people are making fun of him and that i am destroying his business (?). i'm not particularly afraid of his lawsuit and my lease ends next month after which i will be moving out so i don't really care. my question is, did i do something legally wrong? can that be considered libel?

"50k in debt - accepted an offer at a higher paying job but failed background test due to bad credit - now unemployed and scared of the future.. please help me, this subreddit has always given me hope that it is possible to rebuild but i don't know what to do anymore. i ask that you please provide sound advice to get through this and not scold me for my mistakes; i've had a couple nervous breakdowns this week.

&#x200b;

i left a job that offered me a promotion (to avoid burning bridges) because the company i interviewed with extended me an offer. the difference in pay between the two companies was roughly 30k and the role was a step in the right direction for me career-wise.

&#x200b;

i never thought my bad credit would get in the way of getting me a job and grossly assumed that because i don't have a criminal record that i would move forward.

&#x200b;

long story short i hit a rough patch early in 2018 and wasnt able to pay my credit cards (they went to collections). i'm 30k in the hole in cc debt and 20k in student loans. even though i knew this was ruining my credit i figured if i worked hard, pay for the essentials to live (rent,food, car insurance,utilities, medical bills) and land high paying job that i would be able to get back on track.

&#x200b;

i finally landed that job, accepted the offer only to be told a few weeks later that because of my credit history they would not move forward with me. this broke me.

&#x200b;

not only did i leave a job that offered me a promotion but now i no longer have an income. i've already asked for my job back but have been told their isnt a spot for me there anymore.

&#x200b;

i've been aggressively applying to other jobs in hopes of finding something fast but also terrified that i will run into the same issue again.

&#x200b;

i have 4k left for me to survive. i started consulting again with a company i used to work with in the past (25 hourly) to earn some kind of income; the problem is that its only a few hours a week.

some relevant details: 

1. the state school would cost me ~20k a year after the merit-based scholarship i will receive from the school itself and financial aid. this price includes housing, tuition, books, and food. i would need to find somewhere to live during summer, though.

2. it will only take me 6 semesters to achieve my degree because i have taken prerequisite college courses online.

3. as of right now, i am about to finish my junior year and have a part-time job where i average about 20 hours a week, however, there are no extra hours available. 

4. senior year i will be getting out of school early (about noon), so i could get a second job and work full time.

5. the way my state/university is laid out i will more or less need to buy a car, so i intend to buy a used car at the end of summer (i have about 2,000 saved right now).

6. my grades (top 5% of class) and test scores are good (99.5 percentile) however i am not eligible for need-based scholarships.

which leads to my questions: 

what actions should i be taking now in order to prepare for what's to come? 

is it possible for a teenager to get a job paying more than minimum wage, if so how and where?

what can i do to lessen the costs of college (i've taken all 100 & 200 level courses at community college already so it is not possible for me to go to community college first)? 

what are some costs i should be prepared for?

and finally any other general advice?

my husband finishes his snack a little while later and heads back to the couch while i remain at the table. he pulls his computer towards him and goes, ""omg honey look!  ducks!"" as he stands up holding his laptop and tries to come to me, he trips and falls over the glass end table we have, shattering it. if that wasn't bad enough, he fell onto his macbook, smashing it completely open and crushing it.  if that also wasn't bad enough, he also broke his wrist because of how he fell on it since he was holding the laptop.

hey everyone, first of all, i'd like to thank everyone for the messages and comments on my last post, it truly helped me get off the bed and face the day.

i showed my bf the last post bc i just didn't know how i could say it. he was very sad and disappointed but being asexual he has had his fair number of assholes, but he mostly felt angry for me and agreed with the majority of advices that i should confront her. we decided a letter would be the best choice since i actually write a lot of letters and it's not direct confrontation.

i like writing letters for moments(like, letters for when the person is sad, happy, angry, scared, ect) so i do have some techinique but this was, with no doubt, the hardest things i ever wrote. i decided to go for the simple and blunt. told her i heard what they said about me and while i was willing to work on our relationship, i needed distance from her and this whole situation.

i talked with my landlord(lady?) and she was super sweet and had no problem breaking the lease, i offered to find someone to take up my place but apparently she has someone that could use the room so that's cool

i intended to pack and leave the letter on her bed but she came home early and caught me. i basically said fuck it to myself and told her i heard them saying i wasn't good enough and calling me names.

first she tried to deny, which i wasn't having it, then she tried to justify and say i was overreacting but i just stared at her. then she finally started to apologize and cry. at that moment i actually thought we might be able to save the relationship but then she started making herself the victim. the main points were

1- i just can't understand how hard it is to be pretty(not even kidding)

2- i don't understand how she feels bc i'm used at not being the best

3-it's not fair i get a gorgeous bf, who is completely out of my league while she's single

4-she feels embarassed when we go out together and she has to tell people that my bf is actually mine, not hers

5-she knows asexuality doesn't exist and we're doing this just for attention.

i just kinda froze, i wish i had said something but i couldn't open my mouth. she then said she was going out to ""recover from our traumatic conversation"" and left. 

i just packed the rest of my things and left the letters on her bed. 

i'm currently at my bf's place but i'm looking for a free room that is not super far from my job.

i also wrote and sent letters to my ""friends"" a and then blocked their social media/contacts. i'm certain they'll find a way to approach me as we work close but i can't give a fuck.

besides all of that, last friday i had dinner with my parents, i gave them an edited version of what happened(bc i don't wanna talk about my sex life) and that i broke the lease/blocked my friends. they said i shouldn't be angry bc it was true and that the first time they met my bf they thought i was playing a prank. my dad then started saying i was veing selfish by breaking the lease and, i shit you not, betraying my sister trust and that you don't do this with family.

so yeah, i've been ignoring them since this happened, as well as my sister.

overall, i'm fine, i actually feel more tired than angry or sad


tl;dr: talked with my bf, it went well. talked with my sister, didn't go well. moved out. talked with my parents, they said i'm selfish

"why do i keep getting downvoted every time i encourage someone to work on their marriage before deciding to get a divorce?. i know that most people on reddit are under 30 and i'm probably old school but come on!! all i see is people saying ""get a divorce"" as if it's some mundane task to do. divorce has the psychological equivalent of having a death in the family especially when children are involved. do we as a society not see the value anymore in working hard for something that will benefit all the people around us? when did we start expecting to be happy every single day with our partner? that's not real life, real life has ups and downs. you might succeed in reviving your marriage or you might not but don't you think that it's worth trying your best before jumping to divorce?",11
"i worked at mcdonalds during the very first monopoly contest. i stole so many pieces it was unreal.. i've sorta always been conflicted about this. i didn't really feel bad but i didn't feel the best about it. i was in charge of putting the large inventory ordered away. which was boring, very boring. one day, one of the monopoly stickers was coming off a drink cup and my manager said ""just pull it off"" see if you win. i didn't win anything but that kinda gave me permission to do it later. i got hooked. i started stealing huge sleeves of the hand brown containers. i think there was around a 100 in a box. i would take them home and pull everyone. i won so much food and the set of mcdonald's glass cups. i would place the sleeves in the trash and take out trash. after work i'd go to trash bin and dig the sleeve out. anyway! i think the monopoly game is rigged. that is all.

i've got a couple requests for an update, and to be honest i could have given an update the night after it happened but i didn't want to post too much if something changed. i'm sorry for ducking out of the thread early too. i read the first 400 or so comments and wanted to respond and give information to some of the folks asking, but i didn't really have time since she found the thread. i tried to obfuscate enough details that this wouldn't happen, but it's a unique situation and it got pretty popular and i think one of her friends clued her in.  i hope no other new pet parents had to explain this thread to their sos.

&#x200b;

some of you were asking for specific instances of abuse, and to be honest i didn't really think she was abusing him. i just thought that the way she was interacting with him might be more suitable for another cat. molly did wonderfully with our previous cat, but she was a different cat.

&#x200b;

my original plan was to sit down with her and try to have one more honest conversation about our cat's comfort level in this house. something needed to be done before he turned into a nervous wreck. none of this happened sadly. she came home and had it out with me about everything from the cat to some issues with her family and circled back around to our previous cat, who she kind of accused me of killing (she had end-stage cancer and stopped eating and was having daily seizures. the vet encouraged us to put her to sleep). i'd rather not go into too much detail here, but you guys were right. our relationship had a lot of problems and adopting our cat just made them undeniable. i know some people accused my post of validation-seeking, but honestly it's difficult to tell things are bad when you're looking at the situation from the inside. even if it was my fault, it's obviously time for things to end.

&#x200b;

she moved back in with her parents, and the silver lining is that she agreed to let me keep the kitty. she's been gone about two weeks and he's spending a lot more time out and about with me. hopefully this continues.",3

"i heard my neighbors puppy get hit by a car last night. so my neighbors got a new black lab puppy a few months back, he's super cute and looks about 6 months old. i typically mind my own business and don't talk to my neighbors much but they are really nice people. 

last night i was outside putting up some christmas decorations and saw the puppy in their yard across the street. i didn't think much of it because he's outside sometimes so i figured they had an electric fence or something.

while i'm turned around i hear this big thud then hear this poor dog let out the most awful scream. i freaked out and ran across the street and he was sitting on the side of the road and looked up at me and he looked so scared. i ran up to their door and let them know because i was the only one who heard it happen. 

i'm 6 months pregnant and this literally freaked me out so bad i can't stop crying about it, i keep hearing that puppy scream in my head and everyone is acting like it's no big deal. 

update: i just saw my neighbors come home and they were carrying the puppy into the house so he survived it luckily!!

"for excluding one of my girlfriends from girls' night out after he came out as transgender?.   first off it's not my intent to misgender but this is new to me so excuse me. one of my friends recently came out as trans and said she always felt like a guy trapped inside a woman's body.



  she has started transitioning & wearing male clothing and wants us to start referring to her using male pronouns instead of female. i have no problem with him being transgender however my other girlfriends and i don't feel comfortable including him in our night outs once he's done transitioning.



   we don't feel it's appropriate anymore because it's, well, girls' night out. i mentioned this to my bf and he says it's transphobic to exclude him but we don't feel comfortable with him anymore and i think our feelings overtake his. plus in my defense if excluding him is transphobic then girls' night outs are sexist because they exclude men. i don't think we're doing anything wrong because my safety overtakes his feelings. aita?",3
"my friend f19 invited me m19 to play golf and had her boyfriend control a vibrator inside of her. this happened yesterday. to give a bit of background, i work at a golf course and a girl i had known for years but never been friends with started working at the course. we ended up becoming really good friends and we both looked forwards to shifts together.

the other day she invited me out to play golf with her and another girl from work. i thought it sounded fun so i said yes. the day of, the plan changed and she was now bringing her boyfriend and the other girl was bringing a friend. the course only allows groups of four to go out so she told me to come with her and her boyfriend. i thought that would be fine, but going into it i was hoping this wouldn't be a third wheel situation.

  


we got to the first tee box after stocking up on drinks and immediately i noticed her boyfriend had a sleek black remote in his hand. when she got up to use her driver, she was clutching her groin and telling her boyfriend to stop while she was driving as her boyfriend was laughing. i think i caught on almost immediately as i knew she is a very sexual person, and i know remote control vibrators exist. i was in disbelief and kept playing. this continued to happen for about 8 holes of golf until by the 9th she claimed to have turned it off. it was almost constant throughout the whole round, with them discussing different levels and stuff on the remote. the whole thing was done right in front of me and very obviously, i pretended i didn't know what was going on as it was incredibly uncomfortable. luckily by the 9th hole we had ran out of balls and had to call it. they drove me home and i left the car thinking that was one of the weirdest, most inconsiderate things someone has done to/around me.

  


flashforward to today when i'm at work till 3 and she started at 1. it was at work that i realized how fucked up the whole situation was, and how she thought that it would okay to do that around me. when she showed up to work i was pretty cold, only really saying the bare minimum, whereas normally we would be talking a whole lot. after a bit, she asked me if something was wrong. she was was asking if something happened this morning or today, as if she thought i hadn't picked up on what had happened. i told her that golfing with her and her boyfriend was really weird. she asked what happened, and i told her ""i'm pretty sure you know what happened"". she still didn't fill in the blanks, until i mentioned the remote. at which point she said something along the lines of ""i'm sorry if that made you uncomfortable, i don't i don't know why i agreed to that, i don't know what else to say"". i asked her why she would tell me to golf with her boyfriend and her if she planned on doing that, and she didn't have an answer for me. after a few minutes of that i had enough and left to do a different task away from her.

  


i really don't know if there's going to be any recovering from this as honestly i'm kinda shocked by the lack of respect and her choice to do that in front of me. i really enjoyed being friends with her prior to this and nothing similar ever happened, but i'm truly shocked and kind of disgusted by her actions.

  


i'm curious to hear if people think i'm overreacting, or i'm in the right. thanks for hearing me out.

**edit:** i appreciate all the responses, there have been some really worthwhile ones. i also see a lot of assumptions being made that aren't accurate as these things often go. lastly i got a text from the girl saying she would better explain herself when she gets off work (about 2 hours from the time of this edit). i'll keep you guys updated.

**edit 2:** i hadn't talked to her since the confrontation at work, and i left it at that to see if she would attempt to make amends over text as i really saw no reason trying to maintain a friendship if she didn't reach out. i'll copy paste the message i was sent by her:


hey (my name), 
i just wanted to apologize again. you are right to feel the way you do. what we did was completely inappropriate and unfair. we thought it would be harmless fun but it definitely wasn't. i never meant to make you feel uncomfortable like that and put u in that position. i really value you as a friend and i would never do anything intentionally to jeopardize our friendship. i'm embarrassed and ashamed of our actions and i hope in your own time u can forgive me. u have my word nothing like that will ever happen again. i'm so sorry again (my name)!
 
i responded by saying i appreciated her apology and it might be possible to get past this. but i told her i couldn't understand her motive in all of this, either way it seemed like a total lack of respect and consideration for me in the whole affair.

we'll see where this goes.

**edit 3:** i just woke up. she's currently at work, and i never got a response to what i had sent her about my concerns. tomorrow we are closing the golf course alone just the two of us, so i'm feeling like there will a resolution for the better or worst. right now i'm not sure what that will be. i'll probably get a response later today, as it's really not like her to ignore one of my messages. reading a lot of these comments, i'm realizing i didn't give enough context about our friendship. we became quite good friends after beggining to work together this summer, we both looked forward to shifts together as conversations flowed very easily and we could make each other laugh. we started hanging out quite often after work. through our conversations, some very sexual things came up, but it was mostly either of us just recollecting experiences in the past. when i first met her i thought i met pursue her as we got along well, but i quickly found out she had a boyfriend and i left it at that. i never had any intentions of getting with the girl, or interfering with her relationship in any way, she seemed happy with her boyfriend and i respected that. i valued our friendship, and enjoyed working with her. if there were no motives behind this, then perhaps we can go back to being friends, as it really did make time pass when we were working together.",7

""there's no charge,"" he says.
""no, really, i must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit!"" she says.

"update i (27m) left my gf (25f) because she tried to have an affair. so we had our talk last night. 

i got back and she tried to crack a couple of jokes like things were normal. 

i started it off and told her that i loved her. and i had for the nearly 8 years we were together. but this is something i can't forget or forgive. 

i told her i knew everything said between them. it disgusted me. that it hurt. deeply. and that she did that. 

now, i told her i didn't believe i'd be okay because of this for a long time. that's half true. this will of course take plenty of healing but i know i'll be okay. 

now for her side: 

she told me that none of this had to do with me. none of it was my fault. it was all her. her mistake her fuck up. she had been feeling unhappy just about life for a while. she felt stuck in life and aimless. 

then this guy (an ex-friend) came along and gave her attention and it distracted her from how unhappy she was with how her life was. but then it started to progress to a point she didn't know what to do. 

none of what she said she meant to him. she said it because she knew he wanted to hear it. that it almost didn't seem real to her. it almost felt like a game. 

i told her it was real to me. that she still said those things. that she can't take that back or undo it.  

she told me she never intended to hurt me. that that's been the hardest thing for her. because she knew i treated her better than anyone else will. that i'm the only person who had and will put up with her bullshit. she told me i really did treat her better than she deserved. 

this relationship is officially over though. 

i know there's probably more i wish i could've said but my real takeaway is that i can let go of it. move on and start to live a new chapter of my life. 

i haven't told her this yet (i'm going to monday) but i have an opportunity on a new place with a coworker. their roommate leaves in a few months. so that gives me time to save and get some of my life back in order. 

i have a lot of work ahead of me. a lot of things to figure out. as plenty of people have pointed out, this will be the first time in a long time that i'll be financially and personally independent. i'll only have me to worry about. that's something that'll take some work. but i'm going to welcome the challenge and spend as much time as i can trying to be who i am more than ever. 

i also want to say from the bottom of my heart, sincerely, thank you to everyone that took the time to read and respond in the last post. this has been and will continue to be one of the hardest things i've gone through. but you guys have been so amazingly gracious with your advice. i will always remember this and the kindness of random strangers on this silly little website.

our lease clearly says no pets are allowed except service dogs.  however, one of my tenants, who happens to be a sheriff's deputy, obtained two small dogs (i believe they are chihuahuas) last month.  my in-laws, who live next to them, started complaining about barking.  so i sent them a notice saying they have 30 days to either rehome the dogs, or they can end their lease if they desire.  

he texted me and said can we meet to discuss this situation.  so i said sure, come over to my apartment.  i thought he was going to claim they are service dogs or something.  but when he came over, he was in normal non-uniform clothes, but wearing his gun.  he walked into my apartment and said something like this: look, i don't really care what the lease says, my wife got these dogs and i'm not going to make her remove them.  i said i'm sorry it doesn't work that way, you have to follow the lease.  then he put his hand on his gun, and said if you want to make an issue of this, there will be serious consequences.  i was kind of shocked and didn't say anything, and he left.

"heads up: fannie mae will now be buying and accepting loans made with one credit report frozen. if you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn't freeze all three agencies, do that now.. **why this is important:**
with the recent equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). but if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info. 


**what changed:**
until recently, fannie mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. the change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen. 

**why this matters:**
your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to fannie mae. many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. fannie mae is one of the largest investors here. the loan must be originated and underwritten to fannie mae's standards for them to purchase it. this means that fannie mae's guidelines impact your local banks' guidelines if they sell to them. this change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. so if you're worried about your credit but didn't freeze it with all three agencies, do that now. 


edit: source—i'm a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as i type this. 

edit 2: i'm not suggesting fannie mae originates loans. the thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. fannie mae says they'll take loans that are riskier? banks that sell to fannie mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. this is about fannie mae (being a large investor) saying they'll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen. all i was saying was, if you were concerned but thought freezing one or two was good enough, that's not necessarily the case.

"ex husband is sending his family and friends to my house and my work, does this violate the protective order? and is this considered stalking?. oklahoma here. so for some reference, my ex husband is a horribly abusive narcissist, during our marriage he tortured me physically, mentally, and emotionally. he kidnapped me in 2017 and i managed to get away and run to the police, where i got my protective order. i have ptsd and cut every tie to him completely out of my life, and i've managed to make a much happier life for myself and i'm even making progress with my ptsd. well i was, until all this has been happening. okay now on to where i need help! 

about 2 weeks ago i ran into my ex's best friend at the casino. he sat and watched me and texted someone on his phone for 10-15 minutes. then a few days later, my coworker texts me telling me that they ran into my ex and he was asking if they knew me (we were old acquaintances anyway) and they said no. next, about a week ago my ex's brother shows up at my house and rings the doorbell, and i didnt answer. then, he has his stepbrother send me a friend request on facebook. and 3 days ago, i was at work (retail) and one of his friends comes in high as a kite and watches me for a few minutes. and the final event, he had one of his best friends come out to my house this morning and ring my doorbell. i have no contact with any of these people, and i havent in over a year and a half. i've been a stone cold bitch with strict no contact with anyone who could even be friends of friends of his. 

so my question, 1) is he violating the protective order by doing this? i have no idea if they were trying to relay a message from him or not. 2) does this qualify as stalking? 3) what are my options?

when i came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50f) said we need to take a moment silence for him. after the silence was done, i just said out loud ''i don't care that jake died. he was a bully''. people looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, i could hear some people muttering swear words.

but then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated jake too. honestly i'm fucking glad he's dead. i feel so much better about my life now. some classmates called me ah, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, ah was one of them. i just said to her ''you need to calm down and relax'' and walked away.

"gf walked in on me soaking my willy in a glass of milk. i'm in the navy, and about 4 years ago i was stationed in cuba. i had a new girlfriend that i was trying to impress by cooking her dinner (even though i was a horrible cook).

i decided i was going to make some jalapeño poppers as a side dish, and foolishly decided to use my finger to scoop out the seeds before stuffing them with sour cream.

once everything was prepared i popped them into the oven and decided to take a shower while i waited.

naturally, being a guy i decided to have a wank in the shower. no harm no foul right? 

wrong.

i felt the burn with every stroke, but i was so close to finishing i just...decided to bust a nut... and then i would figure out what to do next. (yes, i know this is my own fault, i'm not proud of it okay?)

unfortunately that 10 minutes of wanking only further cemented the juices from the jalapeños deeper into the skin of my penis. (shocking i know).

the pain soon became unbearable, i was rushing around my barracks room butt naked desperately trying anything i could think of to alleviate the pain: washing my member off with a clean towel, putting ice cubes between my penis and my ballsack, standing in front of the fan, nothing was working. 

then it dawned on me. i recalled hearing that milk can help alleviate the burn in someone's mouth after eating spicy food.. and i knew this was my only hope.

i filled up a glass with ice cold milk, set it on the floor, and squatted down on top of it, dunking my bits into the heavenly, cooling liquid.

instant relief. thank god, i said to myself. there was only one problem, the moment i took my penis back out of the milk, the pain rushed back to my lions.

so i sat there, in a squatting position, my dick afloat in a glass of milk, and realized my blinds were wide open, on a sunny afternoon. anyone could look in and see what was happening. but the pain was so bad that i couldn't keep my dick out of the milk for more than a second or two.

i decided that the only solution was to lay on the ground, face down ass up, so that if i was to flash someone at least they would only see my ass cheeks and not my burning schlong.

i laid there for about 2 hours until my girlfriend came back from work, and found me in my miserable state. 

after a lot of laughter and about 10 minutes of explaining the situation, she asked me ""why didn't you just press the glass of milk into your body with one hand, so you could walk around and put some clothes on and stuff?

needless to say, if i didn't feel like an idiot before, i did then. 

eventually a few hours later i went to the emergency room, where i was given a cream that barely worked, and i was excused from work the next day.

tl;dr

made jalapeño poppers, wanked in the shower, willy burned with the fury of a thousand sons, dipped it into a glass of milk while lying naked on the floor, girlfriend walked in. 
we are no longer dating, but i hope her thinking back on my embarrassing story puts a smile on her face now and then.

"update about the situation with my fiance(m40) and his friend's(f27) bachelor party-trip.. 
original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bb5tqy/my_f30_fianc%c3%a9_m40_is_going_on_a_trip_with_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

after talking some more with my fiance, we actually decided to postpone our wedding. 
we talked a lot about boundaries and i told him that some things are not ok. he has been single and free his whole life until we met and i imagine it's hard for him to readjust his thoughts about some things. 
we also agreed that we both had issues we should work on before getting married. my issues mainly being my insecurities. 

at first i was really sad, but i actually think this is a very good thing. i had so many negative feelings about the wedding, and now we have the opportunity to fix whats wrong. maby the next time we try will feel so much more right, and we'll have mostly happy feelings. :) 

thank you to everyone who commented on the last post! you made me actually take the difficult step to talk about boundaries!

edit: after a series of very uncomfortable comments and private messages, i will not respond to this post any more. i just hope it can be an example of a relationship in trouble that solves it's issues through communication (and also therapy, in wich we agree to go to)",7
"for telling off a nude woman that my kid saw on the way home from school?. i was walking my kid home from school. we are in a pretty nice area so the windows tend to be huge and on ground level. 

my child is 6. suddenly she laughed and pointed at one of the houses. inside there was a completely naked woman leaning down to pick something up right in front of the window. we could see everything clear as day. 

i know the woman, she is one of my wives friends. i laughed along with my kid as she clearly wasn't bothered but inside i was a little wtf. 

i saw her at a coffee and cake morning  at school a few weeks later and she and my wife and i happened to sit on the same table. i tried to be as tactful as possible towards the end and say hey, sophia and i kinda saw you naked a couple weeks back, maybe since you're near the school it'll be less awkward to just draw a curtain? 

she was very offended and told me i was being inappropriate and i was floored. i was even more floored when my wife agreed with her. i told my wife later that if it was a naked dude all hell would have already broken loose. she wants me to apologise to her friend. 

aita? am i going nuts?",3

"update: they're taking my child. so i figured it would be appropriate to do a follow-up post, since my original message had so much support and love. 

original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7er15w/theyre_taking_my_child/). 

i haven't heard from my kid since the service for my wife. 

i spoke with my family attorney, and he said that the state of kentucky passed laws a few years ago that essentially reinforce the concept that the step-parent has no laws, rules, policies, or anything at all in the family dynamic. so, i'm fucked. 

we've tried to be amicable to the father. i've called, texted, no answer and no response. he came by the day after the service to get her school bag, a pair of shoes, and a doll her mother got her. and since that point, no contact. i'm going to keep trying, reaching out to the various family members on his side trying to get him to even pick up the phone, let alone talk to me. 

as for the legacy of my wife, i'm taking what remains of the life insurance policy after the payout for the service, and putting it into my kid's college account. anything left in my wife's checking account is going to a custodial account for my kid, so that when she turns 16/17 and starts looking at a car, she has a down-payment for something that's safe. 

and then we just endure. 

thanks to everyone that gave me a sense of hope, your well wishes, and any attempts at trying to help me through this horrible time. ",2
"i was drunk and pretended to be asleep so i wouldn't have to talk to my boyfriend but it turned dark.. i (21f) was on a work night out two nights ago and drank a bit but wasn't too drunk just tipsy. my boyfriend also went out for drinks and met me afterwards and we went home together.
he was acting rude towards me and was pissed off that i walked out of the nightclub with a male colleague that he knows i'm friends with.

fast forward to when we're in bed, turned off the lights and start to cuddle. he asks if i'm alright and i didn't answer i wasn't in the mood to talk and he just presumed i was asleep.

this is where it turns weird on both our parts, i'm slightly embarrassed to say i let it go this far but at the same time i wanted to see what he was going to do i did not let it go on because i liked what was happening because i genuinely felt sick. 

he put his hand down my pants and started rubbing and when i didn't react he spit on his fingers and put them in me. he then went to the other hole which is something i would never let him do and something we have never done before. i held back every urge to stop him because i needed to see what he was capable of.

he started to wank off and then started going under the covers with the torch on his phone. this is where i couldn't let it go on any further and i started to 'wake up' i asked what was he doing and he said nothing and asked was i okay and started to tickle my back till i 'fell asleep' again.

he tried the flash light thing 2 more times and then ran into the bathroom. after he was in the bathroom awhile i asked was he okay and he said he was taking a shit. 

now i've asked him to move out and he's making it difficult saying he'll convince me to stay with him. he doesn't know i know what he did, as far as he's aware i was blackout drunk.

edit/update: i packed up his stuff and had it ready when he finished work. my mom was home too so at least i had someone nearby.

he sat down and told me he thinks i'm making a rash decision since he thinks this is all over choking and a bite mark he left on me. he went on and on about how he won't do it again and said he'll get help and he wants this to work.

i caught him off guard and asked what was he doing with a flashlight under the covers and his whole face went white he was shaking and blamed it on his heart beating. he said he fingered me for 10 seconds because i was talking back to him which made him think i was awake which i know wasn't true and that he went down with a flashlight because he thought i was bleeding and had to check it wasn't on the sheets.

he ended up saying he felt sick and i said it's because he's caught out and feels guilt. i also told him i might go to the police over the bite. he played victim and stuck to his story even tho i know what really happened.",7

"if you threaten to kill yourself/others, or harm yourself/others to keep someone in a relationship with you, you're a piece of shit.. the title says it all.

i absolutely cannot stand people who threaten to kill themselves or harm themselves or others to keep people in a relationship with them. it stresses the person out as they don't wanna be with you but are scared because they don't wanna be responsible for your death. fuck you.

also i can't stand emotionally draining friendships. i get it. it's okay to be sad or angry or depressed. hell yeah im gonna help you out but for fuck sake don't make every conversation about how you're depressed or upset or angry. let's have a lighter conversation about something we like. shit doesn't even have to be something **i** like but let's have a happy conversation once in awhile. it gets to the point where people don't wanna continue to talk to you when all you are is depressed.

i'm not trying to be mean or insensitive here. i know depression isn't something you can just get rid of. i know that. but one way to help work through it is to try and think more of the happy little things around you. 

i'm sorry if this is all jumbled, i'm just really needing this off my chest right now.

**edit:** holy shit this blew up. thank you so much reddit for showing me i'm not the only one who's been through this.

also to clarify, i'd never cut contact with someone because they were truly depressed and self harming. i would stay and help them out unless it did turn into an abusive move on their part. i have no problem helping people out and making them happy. just don't abuse that part of me.

**edit** **2:** for those of you truly going through depression, get help. there are plenty of online therapists and hotlines to call to help you out. just please please please never let it turn you into a monster where you hurt others and bring them down with you. please get help. it will get better.

**edit** **3:** thank you guys for all the support and all the stories of your guys' experiences with this. for those of you going through this type of relationship, get out as soon as possible. don't stick around with these abusive fucksticks who threaten you and manipulate you. also please know the difference between ""my depressions really getting to me, i'm having suicidal thoughts"" and ""if you leave me i'm going to kill myself and it's your fault""",11
"if i don't attend my sister's $2800 per ticket destination wedding? *i do have enough money.. my sister is having a destination wedding in the dominican republic (all-inclusive).  it'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).
my sister would be very upset if i don't attend.  my parents say i should go, and that i'm being selfish for saying i'm not going.  

my sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   i don't make a ton of money, but i have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  while i really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. and less importantly, i have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as i don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

  in my defence, i've worked hard for my money and i sacrificed quite a lot to be where i am financially.  and while i have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because i earn a big salary. but, because i work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  the cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  it would also require me using a full week of what little time i get off work.

 i really don't know if i'm being selfish, cheap, and callous or if i'm being reasonable.   last night i almost booked the ticket out of guilt, but, i couldn't do it and have since resolved not to go.  so what do you guys think?  not wanting to attend?",3
"for skipping my own wedding to see my dying grandma?. this actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and i honestly don't think i'm in the wrong, i figured i'd ask for an outside opinion.

my girlfriend (then fiancee) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that i've never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. she left me with my grandma and i was raised by her since birth. i have always and will always consider my grandma my real ""mother""  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

about a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. this was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn't have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer's help. she had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma's condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. my uncles and i immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

she doesn't pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. i called my fiancee multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. not only was i not in the best state of mind (again, she's my mother to me) but i needed to be by her side when she passed. i felt sick at the idea of not being there when i could.

my fiancee was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted i get ready as soon as possible. she obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and i understand that it definitely sucks. she also said there was no point in me being there since she won't even know i'm there due to her dementia. i understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn't matter if she realised i was there or not. i just felt i had to be there with my uncles. 

she ended up passing the night of my wedding. my fiancee didn't talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. she said i was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. she thinks that as my fiancee she should take top priority no matter what. my opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

so yeah that's the back story. we have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my gf.",3
"by accusing my son of having an eating disorder.. so, i like to think i'm an o.k mom. i don't smother my son or let him get too crazy. he's fifteen so i always knock on the door, not just to be respectful, but because there's some things a mom shouldn't see.

well, yesterday he left to go to the mcdonald's across the street with some friends. i assumed he'd be a couple hours so as far as i knew i was alone. i decided to take advantage by putting on some headphones that wouldn't be inevitably tugged on with a ""mom, can-"" question following.

i'm doing the dishes, sweeping, trash, etc while metallica is blasting in my ears. i start gathering laundry/putting it away, and unbeknownst to me my son got home earlier than expected.

i decided to toss his gym clothes i just finished washing on his bed while i was putting away my own clothes as our rooms are right next to each other. i did not know he was home. i walk straight in without knocking and i'm horrified.

my 15 y/o son is...shoving a spoon down his throat and gagging over a cereal bowl. what the fuck.

he instantly jumps, slowly turns over to me, and the spoon almost comically drops from his mouth. i set the clothes down and in my confusion/horror sit down next to him.

i asked ""what were you doing?"" and he's extremely nervous and keeps repeating ""it's nothing i wasn't doing anything.""

he's on the wrestling team and it clicked in my head *oh shit he was making himself throw up he must be body conscious how did i not notice he was doing this to himself*. 

i start giving a mom speech about how body dysphoria is extremely common in teens and he shouldn't be afraid to ask for help from a trusted adult, that i'm here for him, he's perfect just the way he is. 

he looks like a deer caught in the headlights and remains adamant he wasn't doing anything. i asked ""is this something you'd rather talk about with (uncle) or (coach)?"" he's exasperated and tense saying there's nothing to talk about.

finally i just have to say ""it's pretty obvious what you were doing and i need you to be honest with me or someone else so we can figure this out.""

him: ""i wasn't trying to throw up!""

me: ""then what were you doing?""

him: ""i needed to know if i have a gag reflex!""

i'm extremely confused at this point and ask why. he blurts, ""i'm gay!"" i'm completely shocked and he has tears in his eyes.

it clicks.

i immediately wish i hadn't done laundry that day and give a quick ""i'm sorry, it's okay, i support you completely, i'll just...leave you to that"" and continue doing chores.

dinner rolls around and he's refusing to make eye contact but eventually we ease into a conversation about how he's been hiding it for awhile, has a lot of homophobic friends and was ashamed to tell me because ""i'm your only son so you wouldn't have grandkids"". he planned to come out in college. i had no idea he thought i'd react that way and assured him i'd love him no matter what.

apparently he's also not planning on...doing anything he'd need to practice with a spoon for in the near future...but was just curious and wanted to be ready. i'm relieved but mostly want to forget i ever saw that. at least it brought us closer.

"it is perfectly acceptable for a sole breadwinner in a family to expect not to need to do any house work.. if you commute two hours a day round trip to your job, work 9-5 at a job you probably hate, all to put a roof over your family's head, put meat on the table, and pay for your kid's school, it should be perfectly acceptable to not expect to need to ""do your fair share"" around the house.

"unpopular opinions are not a confession. please stop posting them here.. hey everyone,

this has always been a rule we've had trouble with, but i just removed an influx of unpopular opinion posts and wanted to restate that we do not consider unpopular opinions a confession here at /r/confession. i don't care if you believe abortion should be outlawed, hate black people, hate new genders people come up with, don't get along with women, or think that trump/theresa may/kim jong un is a good leader. there are other subreddits you can post that sort of content to (try /r/unpopularopinions, for example), but this is not the place. our official rule is, ""we don't believe in thoughtcrime, here. your thoughts, feelings, preferences, misunderstandings, or opinions are not a confession. everyone is allowed to like or dislike different things.""


*so, what exactly is your definition of a confession, then?*

a confession is defined here as: (1) an acknowledgement or admission of wrongdoing on your part; or (2) a statement admitting that you are personally guilty of a wrongdoing.

the word wrongdoing implies that there is an element of action to your confession -- you cheated on your husband, you stand outside abortion clinics and protest, you secretly call your friend the wrong pronouns behind their back, you know you're not supposed to say the n-word but you do it anyways, you had sex with your cousin, etc. part of what makes this subreddit so exciting is hearing about the actual *things* that people have done, not listening to someone rant about whatever topic they don't feel comfortable talking about in real life. if something didn't happen, then it is not a confession. 

please refrain from posting them here and report these types of posts so that they can be removed more quickly. i am happy to answer any questions or address any concerns pertaining to this rule.


have a wonderful rest of your day and happy confessing!",12

"for scaring my my daughter to teach her not to scare animals?. my daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.


she would jump from behind with a stomp and a ""wa!"" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. 


we tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. she thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.


so a while earlier she was on the sofa playing nintendo switch, looking very focused, and i decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.


i approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a ""wa!"". she was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. 


my wife called me a childish ah for scaring her like that, but i meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. aita?


edit: i did talked to her and explain why i did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted i apologise and make it up for her. i don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so i ended up posting on reddit to see if i am really in the wrong.

"thanks r/relationship_advice for being so blunt!. i (33f) posted in here about 2.5yrs ago under an old profile regarding my marriage. the post was taken down by a mod for violating a rule or two, though i'll be damned if i remember which. however, i did get some great comments. my old post had to do with the shit way my (43m) husband  was treating me—financially abusive, emotionally neglectful, cheating, lying asshole. at the time i was still a stay at home mom to my younger two girls, and he was becoming increasingly hostile towards my oldest daughter from a previous relationship. well reddit, it took a while, and a few more really hard lessons, but in september 2018 i moved out of my marital home and into my very own townhome. if i had never posted here, i would only have my own perception of the relationship, instead of knowing how it looks to others. i now work full time, go to college part time. i started to open up to those close to me, and garnered the support i needed to gtfo. i had originally arranged to move out on a monday while he was at work, but murphey's law kicked in at the last minute and he stayed home sick that day! my oldest daughter had stayed home from school to help me move, and we had reserved a moving truck, so when she asked what we were going to do, i told her we would move anyway. he slept through my first load, having no idea of my plans because he'd have been even more financially abusive if he knew what i was planning. when he realized what was going on, he got very angry, lots of threats etc. but, i got out, we worked out a way to coparent without wanting to murder each other (often), and divorce is somewhere in the future. sorry if this isn't for this thread, but i just had to say thanks for being so blunt about my failing marriage that it made me cry sad and angry tears. i needed it.

"by allowing my husband to come to dinner at my boss' house. this actually took place a couple of years ago.

i had just gotten a brand new job that i was really excited about. so i was delighted when my boss - who i had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. 

well, mostly delighted. my husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. because of this, i was worried about him coming along. 

by the time the day of the dinner arrived, i had become so anxious about it that i actually floated the idea by my boss that i wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. she was clearly taken aback and responded ""oh no! i really hope he can, i have a dinner for 3 all ready to go."" upon seeing her dismay, i assured her that i was sure he would find a way to be there. 

well, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. it was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.

i had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. 

my boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when i noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. it was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.

i look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. before i had a chance to fully comprehend what i was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. it hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. 

now my husband does dumb shit, i already told you that. but he's not a crazy person. usually when he does dumb shit i at least understand what he's thinking. there' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.

in this case i was just dumbfounded. i couldn't believe my eyes. i couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. i stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. 

i couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but i also didn't have time to try. i heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.

it suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. he did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. 

i could feel the anger flush through my face. for a brief moment i contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. but no. this was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. not like there was any possible recovery anyway.

my boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill there's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. my boss and i are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

he finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. i leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. 

he makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.

we all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.

as soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.

turns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. my husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. he thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. 

a year or so later my boss hosted a christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. my best friend, jennie, was my +1.

tl;dr: took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. he thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.

**note:** my husband told this from his perspective a couple years ago(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. someone suggested i should tell it from my perspective. hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)

**edit:** ok guys, i probably overplayed the ""dumb shit"" angle. yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  from my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. my husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. 

**edit 2:** no my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although i get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. the usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. if he would've done that, it wouldn't have shocked me at all. this, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn't do things that make him look insane*.  not sure why some seem to be taking the ""he often does dumb shit"" to mean ""he often does completely insane things"", when i feel like i was making the exact opposite point. oh well. glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  also, we all have our faults. i joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc.",4
"husband's co-worker. my husband and i have been married for 6 years and together for 16. we are high school sweethearts. we just had our first child in august this year. i am 32 and he is 34. 

my husband works full time as a pharmacist, and i work at the power board. we have a great relationship, and rarely argue. he is my best friend. 

he took a position at a 24 hour pharmacy as a staff pharmacist to train for a management position in 2015. this is one of the busiest pharmacies in our area. there are 15 technicians and 5 pharmacists including him at this location. they hired a new tech there that i will call jane. she is 24 and married with 3 kids. i think she may have gotten pregnant with her third child after working there. anyway she was a hard worker and my husband got along just fine with her and everyone there. 

however, she started texting him about work related things when he wasn't at work and started calling him bossman. i was annoyed by her calling him that but i let it go. 

when i would go visit my husband at his work, she was always always overly complimentary to me. telling me i was the cutest pregnant person ever, etc. i didn't think much of that as that is not my personality type but each to their own. she added me as a friend on facebook and i accepted. i am friends with multiple coworkers of my husband both male and female. 

she began telling my husband about her marital problems. that she thought her husband was cheating on her, etc. she also wanted him to pick her up and take her to work when the weather was bad, she had car trouble, and other reasons. now the current pharmacy manager does all this, so my husband didn't see an issue with it. so he picked her up a few times when the weather was bad. 

fast forward to may of this year, my husband gets promoted to pharmacy manager and jane wants to transfer to his store. she picks up all the extra shifts there. i'm still pregnant with my daughter and this point, and so i go see him one night. she straight up avoids me. i try to speak to her to be nice and she ignores me. so i ask my husband, he shrugs and says he don't know. 

the texts start increasing and it's more non work related stuff than work related stuff. she starts tagging him in things on facebook and i am uncomfortable with it. so i tell him to put a stop to it. the final straw is she asks my husband to pick her up at a car dealership and take her to work since her car is being serviced. keep in mind that her husband works at the dealership where her car is being serviced and they have a vehicle each. that's when i lost it and put my foot down. 

well she no longer wanted to transfer to his pharmacy after he told her the texts and asking for rides had to stop. she basically went silent. i was still fuming and friends with her on facebook so i posted a meme and she deleted me. she did not block me just deleted me. 

she told everyone at work that i didn't like her and she just didn't understand why and she wasn't transferring to his store anymore because my husband didn't like her. 

my husband had to go back to the store she works at to take care of something and he didn't speak to her, she went to a coworker and was on the verge of tears because my husband didn't speak to her. 

so anyway she gets a new job at the hospital and leaves the pharmacy. i'm so glad to be done with her and the fact my husband will never see her again until she tells another coworker at that walgreens who i am very good friends with that she is coming back on 1/10/19 because she doesn't make enough money at the hospital and has filed for divorce from her husband. i'm not too upset by this. he rarely ever has to go to that store and will never see her. 

well on friday we got news he is going to be promoted to manager of that store and his first day there will be around the time that jane starts back working there. i trust my husband completely but i just don't know how to handle this situation.  they will be working together every day. 

now i realize that a lot of this stuff happened while i was pregnant and hormonal but i just have a bad feeling about all of it. 

any advice is appreciated, and i'm so sorry for the long read. ",7

"for not giving the source of my beaded earrings to a white woman?. i was born on a res and lived there for most of my life until going to college in a nearby state. in my community, we have a number of talented women who are amazing at beading. they make some truly remarkable stuff. caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. it's just how they do it. 

i have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. almost every day i wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who i am, where i'm from, etc. brings me a lot of joy.

anyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. she compliments them and examines them. no issue there. lots of people do. one day recently though, she asked me where i got them and if the person has an ""etsy"" shop or something where she can buy her own. this woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. 

now... personally i have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! it's not about that. wear whatever you want. but the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). it's just not done. 

i told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. i told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. she kept pressing me, telling me ""well let her make that decision!"" and stuff like that. 

i got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. she got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to hr about me being racially discriminating.

aita? 

my reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make ""boho style"" earrings), etc. she is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",3
"correcting someone elses child's disrespectful behavior should be acceptable. i was recently at a party and one of the partygoers brought their child. i have nothing against kids but this little one was being an outright menace. he started screaming and crying when the cake was being served because he wasn't the first one to get cake and then flipped his mom off when she asked him to stop. he's four. it was extremely uncomfortable because mom did nothing and awkwardly stood there and just let this happen. party continues and he then is pitching golf balls at a window. my fiance asks him nicely to stop (there were other kids nearby who she didn't want caught in the crossfire) and the mom went ballistic on her saying ""don't tell my kid how to act"" etc. if you can't be bothered to instill good behavior into your kid i feel like you shouldn't be insulted when other people do it for you

edit: hi everyone! so i wanted to quickly edit the main post because i've noticed a trend in people saying that physical reprimands on other people's children is okay, and i absolutely do not approve of that in any way shape or form. what i'm talking about here is an incident where my fiance used her best judgement to step in and ask a child to not throw golf balls at a window because there were other kids nearby.

"charged $750 for a negative review. hi all! my parents recently just took a vacation to key west, florida. while there, they paid to take an hour and a half jet ski tour. while on this tour, the tour guide sped through and it ended up only being a 50 minute tour. she told the tour guide about their displeasure with the tour, speeding through and not being able to see as they sped through, and the tour guide was very rude and dismissed them. my mom took to trip advisor, yelp, and google to leave a negative review about their experience with the tour company. the next day they were charged $750 by the company, my mother called, and was told by the owner that they were charged the $750 due to leaving negative reviews which was slandering their company and then proceeded to hang up. 

is there anything they can do? my parents reported it to their bank as fraud, the bank said it wasn't considered fraud and that it was a dispute. the local police also were no help when called. 

since this situation occurred, the company owner has used my mother's facebook pictures and shared them all over facebook, with messages saying she was extremely drunk, and didn't know what she was talking about. (if she was drunk why would you let someone on your jet skis? is that not a liability? 🙄


my father then called, threatening a lawyer and the money was eventually refunded. 

i just wonder how much these people have made off of people leaving negative reviews about their company. is this legal? can you be charged for leaving a negative review? i've never heard of such a thing. 
thanks in advance!


edit: thanks all for the help and support! everyone has been super helpful and has given a lot of great advice! i've been getting a lot of messages asking for the company's name, and i'm not sure legally i can do that or what the company could do for me giving out their name. 

we got our money back, which is great, i was really after how we could potentially stop this from happening to other vacationers! according to the other reviews, he's done this to countless others as well. 

thanks again for all the helpful suggestions! :)",2

"if i ended my friendship with my best friend who is gay?. alright, hear me out, because i know how this sounds. i (22m) have been best friends with ""john"" (22m) for about 6 years. we always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but i never really thought much of it. about 5 months ago, john came out to me and i was completely supportive, but to be honest i started to consider some of his actions in a new light. 

for example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. i am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if i ever spend time with a girl over him. he always says things like ""you don't care about me anymore!"", seemingly just to get me to say that i do. it's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly i am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.

i told him about a month ago that i would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. he was upset, and again it was about how i am trying to push him away. we haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that i addressed.

i feel like i can't put up with this anymore. i want it to be clear that i have **no issue** with him being gay, but i would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.

"by pretending not to be korean. so i'm korean-canadian but was born in canada and have grown up here my entire life. i ""speak"" korean but it's about at the level of a talented ten year old with a funny canadian accent.

fuck-up happened yesterday. i'm walking down the sidewalk and who i assume are a man and his daughter (who appears around my age) are puzzling in korean over a directory sign. i ask (in korean) if they need any help. the dad seems excited to meet someone who speaks korean. the girl seems shy and doesn't say much besides ""thanks."" they're looking for a nearby mall so i offer to walk them over there since the train station i need is nearby anyway.

the dad asks me where i learned to speak korean so well. this is where the fuck-up begins. i'm pretty insecure about my spoken korean, so when the dad asks where i learned the language, it sounds like he thinks it's obvious i'm not ""actually"" korean. it doesn't help that his daughter is ridiculously pretty, and i want to impress her for some reason. so, i lie. stupid idea. i say i'm actually chinese and learned korean on my spare time, changing my skills from ""mediocre for a korean person"" to ""impressive for a chinese person.""

alas, the dad immediately switches to mandarin which i can't speak a word of. this would have been the time to come clean. instead, panicking at having been exposed, i do my best confused face and then pretend i misspoke and said the korean word for ""chinese"" (jung-guk) when i in fact meant ""japanese"" (ilbon). ha-ha, sorry, my korean isn't very good, right?

of course, the daughter suddenly bursts into fluent and excited japanese, which i also can't speak a word of. i'm in too deep at this point and can't tell them i'm vietnamese or some other variety of asian without making myself even more suspicious, so i do the only logical thing and say i am indeed japanese but don't actually speak japanese (but learned korean cuz lol i'm a traitor to my japanese heritage).

we reach the mall and i'm all too happy to bail at this point, but the girl, who suddenly seems super interested in me, asks (now in practically perfect english – damn polyglots) what i do. i say i go to the local university. she excitedly tells me that she's starting at the same university in september, and that she has just arrived in canada from korea. her ""dad"" seems just as excited by this news and asks me to take care of her once school starts and he goes back to korea.

it turns out that the girl is actually japanese but went to some exchange program in korea for a few years, and that the ""dad"" is actually her chinese-born korean teacher/ sponsor who accompanied her to canada. so, not only did i pretend not to be korean to two people who weren't even korean, but i pretended to be chinese to a chinese man and have now convinced a japanese girl that i'm japanese.

so i exchanged contact information with the girl and we've been talking a lot online since yesterday. turns out she's super nice and funny and interesting and accomplished. we have a ton in common too. we have the same major, and we're the same age, though she's three years behind me because of her exchange program. she seems super stoked to be friends with me since she doesn't know anybody in canada and has been talking to me a lot. i'm becoming increasingly aware that i can't pretend to be japanese forever to this girl and i need to tell her i'm actually korean, but early on she asked me about my family and i went even deeper into the lie, telling her my parents are from kyoto (picked a random city), etc. i've done fucked up, reddit, and i feel terrible about it.

**tl;dr:** am korean, pretended to be chinese to a chinese man, then pretended to be japanese to an awesome japanese girl and am now her first friend in canada (based on a dirty lie).


**edit:** ohhh fuck i think she just asked me out but i'm not sure and i haven't come clean yet help

**edit 2 (night of the 2nd day):** thank you all for the sage advice. i have not yet perished of seppuku as some have feared, although it is increasingly seeming the most promising solution. i'm sure she'd oblige me and do the beheading part.
anyway, i do think we're going on a date tomorrow and i thought i should come clean in person rather than over text. will keep you all updated (unless i die). i haven't even been on a date in over two years so that's already blowing my mind, especially her asking me out. as some have pointed out, i am kinda concerned that she's only interested in me because she thinks i'm japanese, but i think that's more to do with her being more comfortable in a foreign country (canada) when her first friend is a fellow japanese person. maybe i'm terrible at social cues and she just wants to hang out as a friend. in any case, i'll explain it all to her tomorrow in the hopes of being a little less of an asshole (there's no solving that completely). wish me luck in as many languages as you can, reddit. gamsahamnida.

also: they don't use reddit much in japan and korea, do they? i'd hate to be busted via a reddit thread q_q

**edit 3 (still night of the 2nd day)**: oh fuck guys i fucked up again. i was afraid she might stumble upon this post so i asked her if she has heard of reddit cuz i'm a fucking idiot and she said no, much to my relief, but then she asked if she should check it out and i just realized this is going on the front page at this rate and she's gonna find it somebody order an airstrike on me why am i so stupid.

don't lie, kids. lying is very very bad.

"by confessing to my friend i wanted to fuck her. obligatory this happened on monday. so, i have been single for a while and a friend of mine gave me a contact last year, saying you and this girl will probably get along well. and that we did, from december to this month we have steadily been growing closer and having tonnes of fun along the way. sans sexual flirting though. i even nicknamed her my almost soulmate because things just flowed between us. until last week friday when i decided to visit her for easter (she stays in a nearby city).

now remember i've been single for a long time.  and my raging-hormone to logic ratio is at an all time high, thanks to a total lack of outlets. so when she said the entire visit should be spent indoors i thought finally. this is where it happens. i packed 2 condoms to the visit and sprayed deo like a mad man. got there and things were going great really, until after one hour of youtube videos i got nervous and then desperate but i didn't make a move. for some reason i believed something would magically happen and we would end up in sexy time. you can imagine my inevitable disappointment when i had to leave.

so just before we parted she suggested we take pictures and i said cool but really all i could think about was how i had failed at the only booty chance i had had in a year. needless to say i didn't look overly enthusiastic, or even remotely happy on the pictures. which apparently bothered her as she thought i didn't want pics with her because she is ugly (which she isn't) and for the weekend she kept on bringing it up and i kept on saying i was really anxious to travel back home in time. which of course she didn't buy and eventually i thought hey let me just tell her the truth. so on monday i sent her a pic of the condoms and explained my disappointment and sexual frustration, trying to reassure her that she isn't ugly.

and now, well, its been 3 days since we spoke. thanks, hormone monster.

**tl;dr: confessed that i was disappointed we didn't get to sexy time with a good friend and now she won't text me**

"i want to ask my (m34) business partner (f31) to be with me romantically. how do i go about changing the context of our relationship?. 

**background**: my childhood friend (f31) and i (m34) started a business together right out of college. we worked our asses off and became fairly successful. but we put our hearts and souls into it, and because of that our social lives suffered a lot. she was always better at balancing than i and had a long term boyfriend until about 7 months ago. they broke up- in part because he said she always prioritized the business over him (though they were also long distance at the end and that also played a role). 

she showed up at my house crying. we hang out, drink wine, watch movies. i'm chronically single and tipsy and she was now single and tipsy plus neither of us had had sex in a while and one thing led to another. we agreed the next day never to discuss it again. we didn't want to fuck up everything we've worked for or our friendship.

well, this wasn't to be because she ended up pregnant. zero scares with the ex, one night of drunken sex, bam pregnant. we discussed abortion, but she decided not to go through with it because she was concerned she wouldn't get another chance to be a mom. we agreed it could happen with someone far worse, we're already pretty irrevocably financially tied anyways, and we get along better than most people who actually tried to have kids. 

living together just made sense- i have a house i inherited that's bigger than what either of us could've afforded just on our incomes, so there's room for each of us to have a bedroom plus a room for the baby. we spend most of our days together anyways because of work, so living together actually made that easier- now we can carpool. we have separate rooms, though we have been intimate since she moved in and sometimes share a bed. 

 i want to be with her. but i don't know how to move to that step. she's literally next to me asleep in bed. we go out to dinner together, spend most of our time together. i just don't know how to move that into a romantic context, or even if it's a good idea. i mentioned it to my sister who blew up at me and accused me of trapping her, and said that my partner would think i'm asking just because she's pregnant. but the truth is that i think i've always loved her, but i didn't want to admit it because she's way out of my league. 

so, what do i do? how do i change the context of the relationship when we're already so (financially, living together, family, etc) intertwined? 

tl;dr- i got my best friend/business partner pregnant, she moved in with me, i realized i love her, i don't know how to show her.

he got married on saturday to a wonderful (neuro typical) woman. there was a worry that the occasion might be overwhelming for him. with everyone he knows wanting to socalise the crap out of him. to the point where there was a special quiet room set aside for him to use should he need to use it. in the event, he took the whole thing in his stride. honestly, i've never seen him so at ease and relaxed. and happy. and i've never been so fing proud of him.

for my part i had to step up. as a dyspraxic, organisation doesn't come naturally to me. i had 7 groomsmen to organise to ensure that everything went smoothly and to keep him happy and relaxed. oh and a speech to perform. 

i got him to the venue on time. everything went smoothly as i'd been clear about what everyone had to do. i performed my speech. and whilst i couldn't stop shaking throughout, it was warmly recived. people laughed when they were supposed to.

his family came up to me afterwards to give me a massive group hug. to tell me i'd been a good friend to him. this pretty much made me blub.

after this i gave him a bro hug (thanks to his now wife, he's gotten better at physical contact. did l say how amazing she is?) no words. just we fing made it pal.

there's nothing homophobic about not wanting a gay son or daughter.. i'd want my kids to be straight. if they ended up not being straight it'd be perfectly fine and i'd attempt to be there for them the best that i can be. i wouldn't resent or disown them for it. ,6
"true cost of raising a child: $245,340 national average (not including college). i'm 30/f and of course the question of whether or not i want to have kids eventually is looming over me. 

i got to wondering how much it actually costs to raise a kid to 18 and thought i'd share what i found, especially since i see a lot of ""we just had a baby what should we expect?"" questions posted here.

true cost of raising a child (http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/cost-raising-child/). it's based on the 2013 usda report(http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/expenditures_on_children_by_families/crc2013.pdf) but takes into account cost of living in various cities. the national average is **$245,340**. here in oakland, ca it comes out closer to $337,477!! and this is only to 18, not including cost of college which we all know is getting more and more expensive.

then this other article(http://www.todaysparent.com/family/family-budget/million-dollar-babies/) goes into more of the details of other costs, saying ""ward pegs the all-in cost of raising a child to 18 in the u.s. at around $700,000, or closer to $900,000 to age 22""

i don't know how you parents do it, this seems like an insane amount to me! 

-----

**edit** 
i also found this usda cost of raising a child calculator(http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/calculatorintro.htm) which lets you get more granular and input the number of children, number of parents, region, and income. afterwards you can also customize how much you expect to pay for housing, food, transportation, clothing, health, care, child care and education, and other: ""if your yearly expenses are different than average, you can type in your actual expense for a specific budgetary component by just going to calculator results, typing in your actual expenses on the results table, and hitting the recalculate button.""

**edit 2**: also note that the estimated expense is based on a child born in 2013. i'm sure plenty of people are/were raised on less but i still find it useful to think about.

**edit 3**: a lot of people are saying the number is bs, but it seems totally plausible to me when i break it down actually.. i know someone who is giving his ex $1,100/mo in child support. kid is currently 2 yrs old. by 18 that comes out to $237,600. that's pretty close to the estimate. 

**edit 4**: wow, i really did not expect this to blow up as much as it did. i just thought it was an interesting article. but wanted to add a couple of additional thoughts since i can't reply to everyone...

a couple of parents have said something along the lines of ""if you're pricing it out, you probably shouldn't have a kid anyways because the joy of parenthood is priceless."" this seems sort of weird to me, because having kids is obviously a huge commitment. i think it's fair to try and understand what you might be getting into and try to evaluate what changes you'd need to make in order to raise a child before diving into it. of course i know plenty of people who weren't planning on having kids but accidentally did anyways and make it work despite their circumstances. but if i was going to have a kid i'd like to be somewhat prepared financially to provide for them.

the estimate is high and i was initially shocked by it, but it hasn't entirely deterred me from possibly having a kid still. just makes me think hard about what it would take.",10
"for exposing my late wife to my sons?. please bear with me while i try to gather my thoughts and explain just what's going on. i (m40)was married to my wife (f38) for 18 years. we had what i thought was a perfect relationship, we barely fought, got along great, and she was my best friend. we had two sons together, j who is 14 and m who is 16. 

my wife passed extremely unexpectedly a month ago and it absolutely shattered our world. i feel so alone and have even started going to counseling to help with getting over her. 

here is the hard part. two nights ago i decided to go through my wife's cell phone to read our text messages and look at some photos she had taken i never got sent. that's when i found the messages after i decided to look through her browser history. 

messages to men in their 60's sending dirty photos she had sent me. nights she told me she was visiting her sister, she was actually out with these men doing god knows what for money. i don't want to get into to much detail with how filthy some of they were, but i cannot believe she could have done this to me. i suspected nothing. ever. 

my sons are obviously still crushed and always talking up their mother and how sweet, amazing she is. how much they miss her love and honesty. i cannot see her as the woman i thought i knew and i am torn on what to do. on one hand, i don't want to make this passing harder for them and hinder their thoughts about their mother but on another hand i feel they are old enough to know the truth. 

if i exposed my late wife to my sons and told them what she was really doing to our family? please help me.


edit: wow. thanks for all the feedback. i never knew that me losing a best friend, wife and mother of my children would end with me being berated. this post didn't come from malicious intent to hurt my children, and i apologize if it came out that way. i asked because i truly don't know. i feel that i would have wanted to know who my mother was fully but i can see why so many disagree. 
this is something that i will keep to myself for now- and if my children ever inquire further that's something i will deal with along the way. 

to all the ones who were kind, thank you. and to those calling me a selfish piece of shit i hope you are never put in my position. thank you.

last edit: it's now been about 24 hours since my post- which i never thought would get front page- and i want to thank everyone who has reached out to me. i understand that 'exposing' was a very poor word choice and came across the wrong way. i'm still trying to message everyone back who has privately reached out. 
as i said earlier, this will be something i keep to myself and have a talk about truth with my sons down the road. i'm meeting with her family today to figure out what to do about her things and what else. i'm also looking into therapists for my sons today like many of you have mentioned.",3

"don't use debit cards at the gas pump -- or anywhere. it's best not to use a debit card at all, if you can help it.

card readers grab data off a credit or debit card's magnetic strip without your knowledge, with some pump skimming devices being capable of stealing debit card pins as well. it's a good idea to avoid paying with a debit card at the pump. armed with your pin and debit card data, thieves can clone the card and pull money out of your account at an atm.

that's one reason, generally, why security and fraud experts recommend paying with a credit card over a debit card: if you use a credit card, you're not actually spending your money, and you're protected by your issuer's zero-liability policy. when your debit card transactions are approved, the money is taken out of your account then and there. if a fraudster took the funds, you then have to wait for their recovery and return, which could take days or weeks. credit cards can also potentially earn you rewards on gas purchases, depending on which one you use.

some newer pumps may include more mobile payment options like apple pay, samsung pay or android pay, which don't require the customer to share credit or debit information with the station at all. if you use a mobile payment service that's enabled at a gas station your frequent, opt for that payment method over your card. in general, newer pumps are going to be more secure for payments than older pumps.

edit: big misunderstanding here. both debit and credit cards in the us have chips which are more secure against skimming. however, many if not most gas pumps around the us have not been updated with the modern chip readers and therefore people who pay with a card at the dated pumps only have the option to slide their card through the reader. this makes both credit and debit cards susceptible to skimming. credit cards are not immune from skimming. credit cards are more protective against the effects of fraudulent charges on your account.",10
"update: caught so (25m) with my (22f) best friend (23f). thank you for everyone who commented saying to cut them both off my life. it made me see that this is not how a best friend and boyfriend would act. 

just a little update:

my (ex)friend reached out to me and told me that she thinks my boyfriend and i aren't compatible, and that our relationship probably won't last. this really pissed me off. i told her that i saw them that night. she was upset and kept apologizing, insisted that it was a mistake (stuff like that) i told her i didn't want to talk and that was that. i then confronted my (ex)boyfriend and he confessed that they have hooked up before. 

i have since blocked them both. i feel so hurt and i'm not sure when i'm going to feel okay again

"by scratching my neck and getting pulled over. so there i was driving down the interstate going about 70 mph minding my own business. i feel a small tickle on the back of my neck barely above threshold. i reach back to itch the feeling and bring my hand back to the wheel. it's a giant fucking spider! 



worse still, that monster took a short ride on my hand and landed in my lap. i quickly slap the crap out of this thing. well, i am not a smart man. that spider got squashed into liquified guts with my nuts on the other end. i'm not sure if anyone has ever had their nuts thunderclaped while driving but it's not conducive to maintaining your lane. the shock and vomit inducing pain cause me to jerk the wheel and at the speed i was going i proceed to do terrifying back and forth where i nearly flip my suv. naturally, a cop saw the whole thing and the blue lights go up.


so i keep my hands on wheel and the cop comes up to the window. ""son, what seems to be your problem!?"" the cop had been directly behind me and i assume he nearly rear ended me. for whatever reason he wasn't happy. ""officer, i'm not sure if you're going to believe me but take a look at my crotch real quick"" ... awkward pause... ""that didn't come out very well but that mess is what's left of the spider i powersmashed on my balls."" i leave it at that and let him connect the dots. he leans over a little to look at the spider guts. after checking to see if i had any warrants he lets me go.

"for grounding my son for the rest of the year and forbidding him from seeing his girlfriend (or any of his friends) privately because i found out he wasn't using condoms?. two days ago, my 16 year old son came to my wife and i freaked out. he said he's scared for his life and he doesn't know what he's going to do. we had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. he said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn't know what he's going to do because he's not ready to be a father. his girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there's not anything he can do.

i asked him how could this happen; why wasn't she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and especially, why isn't he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. he said that his girlfriend's parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and i quote ""condoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag."" apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because ""together, it's almost impossible to get pregnant.""

i was **infuriated**. i've talked to him all the time about safe sex. we're no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he'd start having sex. which is why we emphasized being *safe*. we've just have had this conversation so many times; i was just so. angry. that my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. 

i told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he's effectively grounded until the end of the year. he can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. he can also only do this only when we're home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). that means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. if he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we'll use find my iphone to track him. he said he understood.

he came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. he asked now that she's not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and i want to stick to our guns on this. though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. but he's shown us he's downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. 

my son maintains that we're being way to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he's also said in the past that he'd never have sex without a condom because ""he's not an idiot."" we just plainly cannot trust him right now. are we being unreasonable?

edit/update: thank you all so much for this information. a little more info on our full situation. my husband and i live in  alaska in a more remote area and it was just the two of us. he died while running a 10k and i saw him about 3 minutes before and he was ecstatic and smiling and gave me a thumbs up. both of our families live in new mexico, so i will be moving back there. the boat was just a pleasure boat we'd use on the ocean and luckily it's a very sought after boat in this state so it should move quickly. we have one truck that is paid off and i will be selling that and keeping my subaru. i went ahead and canceled all of the auto payments on his credit cards and i've already begun paperwork on ira's and the life insurance policy. i'm fortunate that my family has means and are able to help me right now. my parents arrived the day after he died and his dad and sister arrived tuesday night, so i have a wonderful support network. i have about 13000 liquid with about 7000 more coming in so i'll be able to make the mortgage payment, car, etc. while we're waiting to clear things out. the esop is not paid out until a year after the event and my dad has already contacted his financial advisor to help me navigate what to do with the money as well as not to be hit hard with taxes. i'll also be able to receive his permanent fund dividend this year which is good since i guess it's supposed to be a whopper. i feel so fortunate that we somewhat had our shit together. my husband and i were both socking money away into our retirement accounts and we had a modest home so we could have lots of adventures, which we did. we lived without regrets and that is really helping me right now. well i guess i slightly misspoke, i wish we did have more life insurance, but hindsights always 20/20. if anyone can learn anything from my situation it is this: life is fleeting. live everyday to the fullest. my husband and i went on adventures nearly every weekend. whether it be hiking, backpacking, bike-packing, boating, fishing, hunting, traveling, we were always doing something. we told each other numerous times a day that we loved each other and we were each others world. i will get through this and i will continue to accomplish the goals that we shared together. life through me a shitty surprise, but it's not the end of the world. i will get better. my beloved loved to tell me to get my shit together when i was being a whiny pants and that's just what i'm going to do. also, because i'm selfish in my grief and if anyone is interested to learn more about my amazing husband(https://www.sewardjournal.com/eedition/page/page_643cb6a9-a712-5261-8d3f-323e2b159dae.html), i wrote a letter of thanks and it's been published in two papers.",10

hello, it's me. sorry about the new username, i made the first account thinking i would just post & read the replies, so i couldn't remember the password as it was just a jumble of letters. didn't expect so many responses, thanks for your insight everybody!

&#x200b;

it seems folks were split on whether i was being: 1) an arrogant dick, or 2) completely clueless. i think it was probably a little of both. after spending years of slogging by in medical school living like a student, making so much money does really excite me, and i probably came on too strong with offering to buy her everything. it wasn't meant to be condescending, i just want to share my newfound wealth with the people i care about. but, as many of you said, it was patronizing to try and solve her issues with money and to throw it around like it means nothing to me. in the future, i will be a bit more mindful of money can cause a power imbalance in relationships.

this is kind of a non-update, but i wanted to at least thank everyone for the help and tell you that i will take your advice and ease up a bit. i don't want to make her uncomfortable and feel like she's indebted to me. a couple of you suggested a take a page from her book and learn how to budget myself, so yesterday i texted her and asked if she could help me, and she said (and i quote), ""yes, of course! budgeting is fun, you'll love it!""

"by sexually harassing a 9 year old boy. tifu, and it actually happened today. i was driving with my 12 year old daughter. we got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. i glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid walking in the parking lot by himself. it looked like my daughter's friend gabe. i said to her, ""is that..."" and before i could even finish, she said yes. 

so i suggested we say hi to him. i rolled down my window and screamed ""gabe!"" the kid turned around, and that's when i realized it wasn't gabe. it was a younger boy, maybe 9 years old.

"update to ""he's(25) falling out of love and i(25f) don't know what to do"": why he avoided me.. previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b17a0h/hes25_falling_out_of_love_and_i25f_dont_know_what/)

what happened after i made the post: i wrote him a letter, hinting that this relationship won't work if it continues like this. i also printed the post i had made and the comments i got. i thought maybe it helps if he sees it from a different perspective. i put the letter and what i printed on the bed, together with a photo book of an amazing vacation we had. i then removed the sim card from my phone, a), because i didn't want to communicate with him until he read what i had left on the bed, and b), because the phone was actually his old one as my actual phone had been sent in to be repaired, and had now arrived at my parents', and that's were i wanted to spend the weekend. then i picked up all our pets, and left for my home town (i always take them with me when i visit my parents).

apparently, he came home early from work, only about an hour after i had left, to a deserted apartment. when i put the sim card back into the repaired phone about 7 hours later, he had left a few messages, saying that he had read what i had written and printed out, thought a lot about all this, he had looked through the photo book, and had a conversation with a friend. that friend is almost twice as old as we are, used to be his drinking buddy and is sort of a father figure for my boyfriend. he said that this friend had gone through the same situation with his wife. apparently, he had been so stressed out by his job going downhill, he tried to safe it by working longer hours, which sometimes created some tension between his wife and him, so he avoided her by going out for drinks every night, creating a vicious cycle of her being unhappy about not seeing him and him avoiding her even more.

but he had found a solution. he realised that his job shouldn't define his life. he made a list of goals he wants to tick off each week. his marriage has apparently been going very well since then (it's the reason why i said he used to be my boyfriend's drinking buddy!).

my boyfriend said it dawned on him. he's in the same situation. he's putting in as much effort as the ceo who doesn't even appreciate his work. he doesn't want to lose me, i'm the best thing that has ever come to his life. he apparently cried a lot and made his own list of goals he wants to tick off each week. when i came back sunday night, i found it on our fridge. it has very specific goals about him working less overtime and making up for the lost time by taking time off, spontanously going out only once a week max with his drinking buddies, and spending time with me doing real activities at least twice a week.

since then, our dynamic has changed entirely. we had sex. we cuddled. we talked. he was there. now it's only been 6 days since i made the post, but i hope it stays this great between us. i guess the realisations he had could help with him keeping up his new goal habits.

weirdly, all the talks we had before when i told him i was unhappy because we didn't see each other much probably contributed to him avoiding me even more after already being stressed from work. this ""talk"" was different, because it made him realise that he'd lose me if it continued like this, and because it made him reach out to his friend. maybe the deserted apartment contributed as well, because it was a little taste into life without me.

"my car was stolen. police found a 16 year old driving it but say they can't charge him because there is not enough evidence. thief is the son of a city councillor california. my car was stolen out of my driveway. i came out in the morning to find my car gone and some broken glass in the driveway. i called the police and filed a report.

last week the police called me and told me the car had been found and said that i could come and pick it up. i picked it up from the police station but the clutch and the transmission were fried (it's a manual) and i had to get it towed back to my house because i couldn't drive it. the police told me they caught someone driving it and they were working on the case.

besides the window being broken and the clutch and transmission being fried the car reeked of marijuana and had empty beer bottles all over the floor. while i was cleaning it i found a cell phone under the seat. it was unlocked and it had notifications up. i brought the phone to the police figuring that it would help their case. this is where it gets weird.

the officer took the phone but told me there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone with anything so i should just cut my losses and move on. i didn't understand how this was possible because they told me they caught someone driving it and the report they sent to my insurance company confirms this.

i called the police again and kept getting the run around so finally i asked to speak to a supervising officer. the supervising officer told me they didn't have enough evidence on ""john smith"" to charge him with anything. i don't think it's a coincidence that ""john smith"" is the son of a city councillor. the supervising officer told me that the case was closed and i should leave this alone.

is there anything i can do to get them to charge him? he was found driving my car that i have on video being stolen. his phone was found in my car, the window was busted, the transmission and clutch were fried, the car smells like marijuana and had 36 beer bottles on the floor. the bill to fix my car is going to be a fortune. i know that if he wasn't the son of a city councillor he would already be in jail. also despite having a clean driving record and no criminal record i have been pulled over 4 times since i got my car back while driving my rental. all 4 times it was just so the police could ""check my documents"". a strange guy in a suit also came to my house and has sat in a car outside my work. he never says anything to me he just smilies and waves. the police say he isn't breaking any laws by being in public.

what can i do about this? can i talk to the state police or the fbi if the local police won't help?

"i would strongly recommend the military for re-setting your life financially and professionally.. basically what the title says.

once upon a time, i had a ba in a social science field that was getting me nothing but low-paid jobs, and i would have needed to go to grad school to ever have a real chance of landing a salaried position. i paid my own way through college and was not willing to take on additional debt for a graduate degree in an already very competitive (and low-paying) field. i wanted to go in a different direction.

i had worked part-time at a law firm during college, and i decided working in a support position (i.e. paralegal/legal assistant) was something i was very interested in. i applied for positions at every law firm in my general area and received nothing but rejection and one invitation to intern for free. no thanks, i had bills to pay.

the military had always been something i'd considered and i did a lot of research on the different branches and what they offered. turns out the army offers an enlisted position that was exactly what i was looking for--paralegal specialist, and since i had a degree i would enter the military as an e-4. the army also guarantees that the specific job you select is written into your contract.

it's now a little over four years since i raised my right hand-- i now work for the department of justice. my military service counts towards my federal retirement and also put me in a higher leave bracket. the high-ranking connections i made in the army jag corps combined with the job experience i received are what landed me this position. i have thousands of dollars in the bank that i saved because i didn't need to pay for housing, food, or health insurance while i served. i'll be able to use a va-backed loan to buy a house when i choose to, and if i want to go back to school i can do so for free using the gi bill.

i write all this because i read this sub regularly and there are so many posts by people who don't make a living wage, or majored in something unmarketable (like me) and don't know what the next step should be, or who have student loan debt, or are just kind of lost in life. and i think military service could benefit a lot of those people.

of course this comes with a large caveat: the military comes with risks. you could deploy, you could be in combat, you could die, you could be involved in a freak training accident, etc. you could also get stuck in a terrible unit with toxic leadership. it's all luck of the draw really. i was incredibly fortunate in having a positive experience but i know many aren't so fortunate. it's the ultimate 'your experience may vary' scenario. 

but at least for me it was a great way to kickstart my career in the direction i wanted to go and set myself up financially. i just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone who may be considering the service.",10
"i just met my club penguin best friend of 6 years. back in the day, i was a club penguin fiend.  and like many, i made quite a few online friends from club penguin, most of which i made over my (very cringe-worthy) club penguin fan account on instagram.  those days i had some of the best friends i've ever had, i would stay up every night on kik talking in our groupchat and i'd spend every hour after school on club penguin meeting up with them.

with most of them, we've grown apart and went our separate ways, but i've managed to keep one of my best friends in particular.  even after we outgrew club penguin, we would facetime every day, text each other about our lives, play other video games together, and even send each other christmas and birthday gifts!! she's seen me go through both middle school and high school, and we eventually graduated together too.  she's known me through 3 boyfriends, 2 jobs, the worst depression of my life, and many lonely summers.  she's seen me change and grow, just as i've seen her change and grow too.

a month ago, i finally did it- i booked the ticket to chicago, and i flew in this morning.  when she picked me up from the airport, for the first time in our 6 years of friendship, we gave each other the biggest hug.  it's so surreal!  as i'm writing this, i'm in the guest bedroom of her house, and tomorrow we plan on going to lollapalooza together, after she shows me around her city.  best $600 i've ever spent :)



tl;dr i met one of my bffs on club penguin, we've been friends for 6 years.  today i flew out to chicago and met her for the first time.  it was awesome :)",11

"very productive year, disappointing raise, boss said he had too many ""good"" employees. i had a really great year with my company (very large 50000+ employees), deployed 2 new initiatives and was a major part of my department's bi-annual audit.  we got the best scores ever, and both my boss and his boss stated that it was in large part due to the information i was able to provide.

my department is broken up into teams, and the team that i'm on consists of my boss and 4 others.  i have the highest rank of the other team members, although some have been here longer than me.  i am also the only woman on my team, and the highest ranking woman in the department.
  
when the written annual review came up, my boss marked ""exceptional"" or ""outstanding"" for all of my categories.  this week, we got our raises, and mine was very disappointing.  with the scale being 0-4%, i got exactly 2%.  in the past years here, i've never gotten lower than 2.5%, usually 3%, and i've never had a busier or more productive year than 2018.  i honestly thought the past year was my best ever here, and that my raise would be at least 3%.  

in recent calls, my boss has made comments along the lines of how he has such a great team, and how everyone has exceeded their goals.  i used to be a manager (at another company), so i understand the whole ""pool of percentages"" and that things have to be divided fairly (from the manager's perspective).  however, i have always believed that each employee is an individual and should be evaluated as such.  if everyone had an outstanding year, then everyone should receive and ""outstanding"" percentage increase.    

we do not work in the same office or even the same state.  i call at least once a week (usually goes to vm), send weekly updates on progress, and email every day (about something or nothing), just to stay in touch.  i'm pretty sure he's going to use the remote aspect and lesser communication as part of the reason – however he is the one who consistently cancels our weekly calls and does not answer emails.  

he is going to call me later today to discuss.  i know there is no way to change this now, but please help me calm down and determine the right things to say.

update:  first, thank you to every single one of you for taking the time to respond.  i have been reading through all of the posts and seriously appreciate your opinions.  

my boss called a little while ago.  i told him i was surprised and disappointed in the increase amount, given the exceptional work ""we"" had done.  he said that everyone on our team was given 2%, that the amount was set by our cio and the only way to give anyone more would mean someone would get less.   

he also ""reminded"" me that i am the only one on our team (besides him) that gets a bonus.  that comment has led me to believe that i in fact was given more than 2%, and he took my extra and divided it among the others on my team.  whatever.  today has been an eye-opener for me, for sure.

"the next person who says ""aren't you a little young to be using a cane?"" is getting the ugly truth about why i need it.. edit: holy fuck this blew up. i've been bouncing around subreddits for a while now but have never had a post gain this much traction. to answer some of the common questions: yes, i have cut off contact with her. i did so about a year ago after confronting her about the mess she made of my life. no, i never got the chance to report her, she herself was a social worker so the odds of anything happening was zilch. i don't care a whole lot what people think, but after a while it gets really old when people do this shit, which is why i wrote this post. 

edit: thank all of y'all so much for your kind replies. i carry my past around with me invisibly, and sometimes it just gets so frustrating that i can't just yell ""i""m trying my best with what i was dealt."" i made the decision last year to forgive her, simply because holding onto my hatred was poisoning me. thanks to the support of my best friend and her mother, my mentor, and the wonderful healing powers of cannabis, i'm back on the path to chasing my dream. she isn't in my life, and if everything goes according to plan, her effect on my life won't be around in a couple years either. i'll be in my dream school making it work, and she'll still be the same miserable shell of a human she's always been. 

i'm 20 years old, and for the past three years or so, i've needed to use a cane part-time. mostly in the winter, but as time goes on i've needed it more frequently. when my pain flares up, walking without it feels like my feet, shins, and knees are breaking when i walk. the longer i try to tough it out, the more the pain crawls up my body. the cane takes a pain level of a seven or eight and brings it down to a manageable three or four. 

i hate the stares i get. when i take the bus, older people give me hateful glares for sitting down in the seats reserved for disabled and elderly people. even with my cane in my hand, they stare at me like i just slapped them. people my age gawk at me when i'm out and about. the nicer people try to joke about it. laughing, they ask ""aren't you a little young to be using a cane?"" 

yes. yes, i am a little young to be using a cane. you want to know what else i was a little too young for? i was too young to be thrown around like a fucking rag doll by my mother. i was too young to be snatched by my hair and dragged down stairs. i was too young to have my face thrown into cat shit for being a forgetful ten year old who was too busy fantasizing about suicide to remember to clean it out. i was too young to be grabbed by my hair and have my legs swept to be thrown to the floor whenever it amused my mother. i was too young to be forced to ""train"" until my joints popped out of place, my knuckles bled, and i was barely able to breathe. i was too young to be forced to fight adults three and four times my size. i was too young to be hit with bamboo and solid wood swords until i bruised and bled three times a week whenever i couldn't hold forms perfectly. i was too young to be ""restrained"" with my face shoved into a concrete floor, simply because i didn't want to stand there while my mother took out her anger on me with a belt. i was too young to have my body broken to the point that i don't know if i'll ever have functioning joints again. i was too young to be the scapegoat and punching bag of a six foot tall, 300 lb woman. 

so yes, i'm a twenty year old using a cane. for the first time in my life, i have access to tools that make my days less painful. i'm too young to need it, but my mind and body have been aged so much by the violence done to me that it doesn't really matter. shut the fuck up and let me sit down when i get on the bus. you don't know how much pain i'm in.

"after i (36f) told my dad and stepmom (both late 50s) about my engagement and their response triggered me to suddenly remember years of repressed childhood memories and now i do not know how to move forward with our relationship.. long post, but there's kind of a lot to this...

repressed childhood memories coming back? i have heard of this happening but i honestly never thought i'd experience it and holy shit this has been jarring.

my dad and stepmom have been together since i was age 3, so 33 years.

my childhood was a disaster zone. i have lost large chunks of time where it is a big blank area. i thought it was maybe because i had to take so much benedryl as a kid because my allergies were so bad that i didn't remember much. now i think the memory loss is mostly trauma-related. dark murky memories would come up but i have had no real timeline of my childhood. my mom was married many (many) times and we moved a lot and she had a baby and then another baby and then two more babies. i can sometimes piece together a home we lived in, or what school i went to when, but it is all a blur. i was both my parents first child and the baby of teenage marriage. there was alcoholism and drug use and chaos. somethings have always stood out... like the time a stepdad put a gun to my mom's head. or, my sister being born. or, times when we had to move out fast and we were told to start throwing the things we wanted into garbage bags and put them into the car.

my mom and i were very close and i was kind of her copilot through all the crap. crazy as our life was, i loved the hell out of her and she died 2 years ago from cancer. all in all, i have had a kind of hero through it - my dad.

&#x200b;

about a year ago, my dad, stepmom and i were sitting outside around a backyard fire having drinks and real talk. he said something that surprised me, which was that i had lived with them as a kid for a period of about 4-5 years. this was news to me. i had not remembered living with them for that long at all. in my head, it was maybe 6 months. my dad was hurt i did not remember living with them. during that time, my stepmom apologized for being so mean to me during my childhood. i shrugged it off and joked, ""well, i guess its water under the bridge since i don't remember."" she said, ""no, i was really mean."" and, i said, ""it's okay. all of it has come around. we are good now.""

&#x200b;

fast forward to two days ago. over the weekend, the man i love got down on knees and asked me to marry him. magical moment and we have been very happy. in fact, it's the first relationship i have ever felt safe in, but it takes work and effort for me to trust. i tell my dad and stepmom the news and watch the whole thing turn and capsize. my dad makes a comment about how i had to beat my sister to a ring (my sister is their daughter/ my half-sister and is in a serious relationship that is also leading to marriage soon). i am struck. i do not feel competitive with my sister and she and i have always celebrated each other's victories. then, my stepmom asks about where and when and i tell her it might be a year out and she starts making excuses about how she will not be able to go, not willing to go, but tells my dad he can go. i hear this and know my dad will not ever take a trip without her and start to panic that he will not come to my wedding. the comments pile and mount, one on top of the other, until my whole body is trembling. although i have been sober for over a year suddenly i want nothing more than to drink. but, i do not drink and say everything is ""fine"" when asked and try to leave on a good note to make sense of my feelings in private.

&#x200b;

something that needs to be explained is that there has always been a strain with stepmom and me. i try hard to do things right, but i am scared of her and always have been. as an adult woman, she still scares me. she is incredibly controlling, powerful, dominating and it is hard. my tactic in avoiding being a target of her passive-aggressive behavior and anger is just to be super nice. nice all the time. smile. swallow. repeat.

&#x200b;

when i came home from the engagement announcement, it was like the flood gates opened.

one memory cascades into another and another and another.

suddenly i can recall being 7 and 10 and 12 and all the fear i had as a child in their home.

i remember how much she hated me. the name-calling. the scapegoating.

i remember sucking back tears and being told not to cry at all. i remember hearing all the time ""you're fine.""

i remember the secrets i had to keep about how mean she was. i remember walking down the hallway in our home and being pushed into another room while my dad watched tv in the living room and her whisper-screaming that i was a brat and a terrible child and was ruining her marriage and being told to say nothing to my dad.

i remembered she controlled my sleep habits. i have always slept on my stomach but she required that i slept on my side to face my little sister at night and would come into the room in the middle of the night and catch me on my stomach and wake me up to yell at me and tell me to go back on my side.

she controlled the relationship i had with my dad. we could not do anything she was not a part of, did not supervise, or control.

i remember being cornered again and again. i was targeted and she was after me and it was relentless.

i remember her sisters telling me how sorry they were and that is was not okay for me to be treated this way.

she was a relentless bully.

i remember my sister who is 7 years younger, always trying to protect me and shield me from her mom.

i remember being taunted and teased and made fun of.

i remember one time she yelled at me out front of our house and i got so scared i peed my pants and had to run inside and change.

i remember our neighbors saying that i was safe in their home and if i ever made a mistake in their house they would not tell my stepmom.

i remember when i left my dad and stepmom's house to move back with my mom that they took down all my photos from the walls and told me they would be fostering or adopting a kid to fill my place.

when i moved back with my mom life changed and was chaotic in the way it was with my mom so i think i just forgot all of this stuff and kept going.

but with this sudden flash of remembering everything now, there is just anger. layers and layers of anger. anger that my dad did not stand up for me. anger about what they knew, but i did not. a huge sense of abandonment. what the hell is this? how can i have forgotten all of this? how does it just sweep from view?

&#x200b;

in my head, i rage at her and the main thing i say is, **""guess what? now i remember.""**

&#x200b;

i sent them a text. a sheepish way to confront it, but for once i stood up for myself. it was very hard and my whole body quaked and trembled. they did not respond.

&#x200b;

the thing is... they have been trying in the past few years. they moved to my state. they want a relationship with me. she did apologize back in the yard that day. i know my dad loves me and tried in his own way to protect me. i don't think i will get any sense of accountability from them. but, now it's like this mystery has unlocked inside me. i always felt unsafe around her. i never felt like even when she has been nice to me as an adult like i could trust her. now i know why.

&#x200b;

i think i am about to lose this last remaining chunk of parents i had. my mom is gone and i have continued to work through all the things that happened with her and will head back to therapy to deal with the rest...

&#x200b;

my sister asked what i want to come of all of this. why put it all towards them? what kind of battle am i setting out to wage? and, i really don't know. i didn't see this coming and i am at a loss. i feel guilty for bringing this up. like, i am going to wreck the family. but i am also furious. i want them to have to hear it all from me. i want to ask my dad what he did and did not know. i want her confession. i feel like i can already hear my dad telling me not to be so dramatic, and yet, i feel like i will not be able to stuff this one back in.

&#x200b;

how can i rehash something that i only now remember? is it worth it to even try or do i just salvage a fake relationship for the sake of having one?

i feel bad about feeling sorry for myself. is there anything that will come from holding them accountable or am i just headed down a path of anger and victimhood?  i wonder if we can even have a relationship from here...

&#x200b;

**tl;dr: i recently told my dad and stepmom i was getting engaged. my dad brought up my sister's likely engagement immediately and completely derailed my news. my stepmom said she wouldn't be coming to my wedding. it brought up years of bullying from my stepmom and neglect from my dad that i had forgotten all about. now i do not know if i can or want to have a relationship with them and feel insanely guilty for even bringing it up.**

&#x200b;

edit/update: wow. this went... 

i figured this would be my own private story/rant for a few eyes in a corner of reddit. i did not expect this response. i've been battling with wanting to take it down now. my fiance has encouraged me not to. i've been panicking that my parents will see this. i do not want to hurt them. there is no part of me that wants that. even in anger. i just want them to know and be honest, without downplaying what it actually was. not sure that will happen. pretty unlikely, but its a want. as for what to do about it. i will head off to emdr and have a handful of referrals for monday. i will take the ""damaged old person's"" advice (thank you) and move slowly here and get help and not go scorched earth just yet. 

thanks for the help, encouragement, and congrats. 

as for my partner, which a few posts have asked about... i think he has been a huge reason this is coming out. i think the security of our home and relationship, plus lack of booze as a coping strategy, has meant that now there is the opportunity to actually feel things? i dunno. new territory. he has been hugely supportive in all areas of my life. he is sober, too. a processor. a thoughtful person and we have sat and read some of the responses together and appreciated the insights and conversation. 

as for those questioning validity of my memories, or repressed childhood stuff? new territory also. like i said at the top, i had heard of this but didn't know it was an actual thing till i was in it. i can only speak to my experience right now as it is occurring and it's been like a download of fresh information complete with recalling my home, surroundings, time of day, where i stood, where others stood, facial expressions, tone, who was there, what was said... so, no my brain didn't just fabricate a false set of memories. i feel the truth of all of these things in my core. this stuff was in me and there is not a question of its reality. the blanks have just been filled in. it feels like a very unfortunate aha moment. 

thanks for all of those who have shared their own personal stories of hardship and pain... man, some of us have walked some really tough roads. i'm sorry for you all, too. someone shared a link to an article about how isolating abuse is. it's true. makes me feel crazy. there is a strange solace in knowing others are out there powering through their own pain, too. take good care.",7

"update on: i'm a female born without a vagina. how do i tell a guy that i'm interested in about it?. here is the link to my first post, if you're interested: original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3o3w/im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how_do_i_tell_a/)

i apologize for the length of this, but i supposed i needed something for me to layout what happened and come to terms with it. so, if just want a plain update, and don't want to read this (which will probably end up being very long): 

i**n short, it went terrible. and frankly, i didn't handle it well.** 

the original plan was to get coffee, see how the date went and go on from there. he told me he had been recently fat-fished (not sure if that is the correct term, but he had previous met up with a girl that was waaaay heavier than what was presented in her dating profile, and it allegedly went poorly). 

he was texting me less and less leading up to the day we planned on meeting, last wednesday. he texted me tuesday morning saying that he was sick, and apologized for the lack of communication. i had classes that day and was only able to get back to him later in the evening. i asked him if he was busy because i wanted to call him, see how he was feeling, and figure out what the plan was. i told him that health comes first, and we can always reschedule, but he insisted how badly he wanted to see me. somehow he convinced me to see him tuesday, at his place, even though he was sick.

once i got to his place, he was extremely sweet and nice. we totally hit it off, he complimented me a lot, said i was cute and hugged me, twice, all excitedly like when a puppy see's you when you get home after a long day. he made us coffee, and we talked about life, school, family, hobbies/interests, etc. it was going very well. we got into the discussion of movies/tv shows, and he ended up turning on his tv, and switched to netflix. i asked him if he watched any anime. personally, i'm not big on anime but i've seen a few shows because my younger brother is into it. i recommended full metal alchemist to him and we started watching that. he asked if he could sit closer to me, i said yes, and he noticed i was cold, so he turned up the heat and brought out a blanket for us. i had my head resting on his chest with his arm around me, and i joked about how fast his heart was beating. he said that it was probably because he had a cute girl sitting with him. in that moment, i realized i had to tell him about my condition. it took awhile for me to get into that discussion because 1) i just wanted to hold on to that moment for a bit longer and 2) i wanted to tell him, but i couldn't get the words to come out. he looked at me and tried going in for a kiss, but i pulled away. i said that i had to tell him something and asked him to turn off the tv. he obliged. i just froze after that. i literally couldn't get the words to come out in the way i wanted them to or how to begin to talk coherently. even though i asked for advice in the previous post, i totally went blank in that moment and none of it was implemented effectively. i tried changing the conversation because i felt like i was going to cry but he assured me that i could tell him. i honestly don't remember what i said because i'm pretty sure my brain shut down, but i managed to mumble some sort of god-awful explanation. he asked a few questions, and then said he wasn't sure if he could be in a relationship that doesn't involve sex. he said that we could keep it casual for now and see where things went. 

even though i originally went in with the worst expectation, i was still hurt by what he said. i felt really let down because he met a lot of the things on my checklist and i thought we connected well. i asked what ""keep it casual"" specifically meant for him, and he said that we could be exclusive, but he didn't want to get too emotionally attached. i guess that was the part that really stung. i told him that i wasn't looking for a definitive answer yet because it was still too early to tell anything, and i wasn't looking for marriage, but if he knew right now, for a fact, that he can't be in a serious relationship with someone that has my condition then i wasn't interested. i know myself too well and honest to god i can't get involved with someone without getting emotionally attached and agreeing to ""see where it went"" would be intentionally setting myself up to get hurt. plus, i think that was just his way of saying no to me nicely. he politely said that we could both take a few days to think about what we wanted, and he'd let me know. he was just trying to let me down easy, because we both knew what he meant. it was around 8:30pm by the time we got done with that discussion and i said that i should probably leave. he walked me to the elevator, in silence, and as i was about to enter the elevator he asked if i would still be interested in being friend because he enjoyed my company. i said i wasn't sure, and that i'd talk to him later. by the time i got down to the 1st floor and out the building, i had tears down my face and i felt like absolute shit. 

pretty much every guy i have told about my condition would later go on to say that we could be fwb or something more 'friendly'. i just felt like no one would ever want me for me, and that all i would be good for is some side action. i felt really alone. i felt that the only reason i had ever been in a relationship previously was because i hadn't been diagnosed with my condition when i started dating my ex, and we had already been together for a year when i did find out. i felt like he only stayed with me a year longer was because we had an emotional bond, but even that came to an end when he cheated on me. i'm not that insecure but at that time i couldn't think straight. i had just experienced something nice, and it was instantly taken away from me. i haven't had many friends after my ex cheated on me with my best friend and i cut contact with everyone in that circle and making friends at university is difficult if you're a commuter. i ended up calling a guy i know as i walked back to the subway. i don't really consider him a friend anymore because he has told me he has feelings for me, but i don't feel the same way back towards him, and he makes constant cheesy statements about me and him despite me telling him not to. i don't want him getting too attached to me, so i keep my distance. but in that moment, i really needed someone, and i didn't have any other option. so i called him, he picked up, i asked if he was busy, and he said he was playing a game with friends and he could call me back later... i didn't want to bother him like that, so i told him it wasn't necessary. so, i did something  very stupid, and called my ex. his gf (the girl he cheated on me with) had him block my number, so it went straight to voicemail. like any insane person, i left a very pathetic voicemail, sobbing and all. i said i didn't have anyone to talk to and apologized for calling him, but i couldn't think of anyone else to talk to. i didn't mention what happened or anything, just that i needed someone. i stood outside in the cold (its snowing here) for awhile until my whole body felt numb. i gathered myself and thought ""c'mon, what are the fuck are you doing? this is not you. you're better than this."" i promptly got on the subway, went home, got into bed, and went to sleep. 

i woke up the next morning with a fever (that's what i get for getting too close to a guy that's sick) but still had to go to class and attend tutorials. i thought about my reaction a lot, and how poorly i had handled it. clearly, i have issues i need to work on. i stayed late after the tutorial getting extra help, and after my ta was done helping all the other students, i went to her office and privately asked her if she had any recommendations for someone that i could talk to on campus. she asked me if it had to do with academic stress or something more personal. i said the latter. she pulled out her laptop so quick and got me numbers/emails/addresses for places i could contact on campus. she told me that she understood and that she too was having issues a couple months ago and recommended a clinic she had been to personally. i couldn't stop thanking her. before i left, i said, ""it's not a big deal or too serious, i guess things could always be worse"" and without skipping a beat, she said ""yeah, but things could also be a lot better."" i thanked her for her help and left. 

he hasn't texted me in 2 days now. i'll wait a little longer, but i guess i got my answer. i realize i am not ready for dating. for the time being, i should get help.

its not that i can't handle rejection, but that fact that time and time again, i get guys who are totally into me, and aren't looking for sex right away because they want something more meaningful, but as soon as i mention no sex at all (for now, at least), they turn me down. if they rejected me right from the start, and we didn't get along well, i could handle that perfectly fine. i cant help but think i'm a defective human, and will never find a guy who would appreciate me for me. 

i have yet contact the number my ta gave me.

if you've read this far, thank you. if you have any advice, things i should improve on, better ways to handle situations like this, constructive criticism, or any other comments, i would greatly appreciate it. thank you. 

edit: i woke up to a thousand notifications lol i was not expecting for this post to blow up! thanks to whoever gilded this. i have no idea what it means or what it does, but thanks! 

i just want to thank each and every one of you guys that took the time out of your day to comment on here. i spent a good chunk of my morning just reading the comments. your kindness and honesty has really touched my heart. some comments made me tear up. i didn't know i needed to hear the things i did. thank you. a lot of people also reached out to me personally and offered to talk to me, after i said that i didn't have many friends to talk to. you guys are one of the nicest people ever. i truly do appreciate it. the internet is one hell of a thing!

it's unrealistic for me to reply to each comment but i'll try my best to get to it over the next couple days. i will read all the comments and message even if i don't get around to responding to them.

 truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you reddit. ❤️ 

edit: i'm getting a lot of questions and comments about my conditions and the specifics of it. i'm currently a little busy right now but i'm going to add another edit later today or make another post about it, explaining it better and why my condition wasn't diagnosed when i was born and a little more about my family situation and options for surgery. 

i'm honestly surprised that this is getting so much attention. but i'm also happy that i get to inform and educate others! ",7
"city government lied that our water was safe. we paid for our own test and it proves the water violates the epa safe drinking water act. what do we do now?. our water quality is directly linked to the amount of water being used. the more water the city pumps from the aquifer the higher the radium numbers rise. our city had been testing the water only during our city's lowest usage days.

a member of the city paid for an independent water test. the results violate the epa's safe drinking water act.  

anytime someone has gone to city council meetings and asked for the water to be rechecked they were literally told to shut up and sit down.

can we have a class action lawsuit? how do we force the city to join the nearby cities water system that does have safe drinking water? what can we do?

what's the one horror movie that genuinely terrified you while watching it?. ,1
"for introducing my gf as a model?. so i have been dating this girl for awhile now. she's beautiful. she works as a professional model. not like an instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

she also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. she usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. for some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. she only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

so the other day i was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. i said ""thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. later she said i was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and i had no right to correct her. that what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. that her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

i dont see what the big deal is so here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*edit just to clarify i she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. i just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after i did it. also i was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when i introduced her to my friends.

\*\*edit 2 theres so many comments and i am trying to read them all. i do respect her. i do love her for more then her beauty. shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. she's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. honestly i am blown away with how pretty she is and i've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. so that part does excite me.

i genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think i am the asshole for this i do value how much money a field brings in. when i chose my area in college i did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. i am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and i am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. i'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

i shot an apology text (we're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her dojo. she said we can talk after work and i offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200b;

\*\*final edit

at this point i imagine no one is reading anymore i asked the mods if i should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

i was really bothered by the things people said. not because i wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. i didn't want to be the guy everyone said i was. i really didn't.

&#x200b;

first i want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. yes i knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. we have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200b;

next i want to say she was meeting some of my good friends. i was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. i was trying to point out her accomplishments. i thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. i can see where i was wrong. i did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and i felt it was more glamorous. i am an asshole for that. i did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and i'm also the asshole for that too. i wont deny it. but i dont just see her as a trophy. i do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because i learned something really really important.

&#x200b;

after this thread blew up like it did and i had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick i was i knew i was dead wrong and had fucked up. i texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. i asked her if we could talk about it and i could try and make it up to her. she agreed. i told her i wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if i could sit in on some of her classes. she said she would like that. i made it top priority. i left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200b;

what i saw really opened my eyes to be honest. i watched two classes and took part in the second one. the first one was her with a kids after school class. she was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. thats dead wrong. it must be much harder to teach kids and i think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. i saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she does want to be a mom one day).

&#x200b;

the second class was a womens self defense class. i took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and i was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. i got manhandled by about 15 women. we had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. for those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200b;

i definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. she taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. most importantly i saw the qualities beyond her appearance that i love most about her really shine. i realized the things i love most about her; her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. this is really the part of her i love. it doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. i also saw how much she loved what she was doing. i saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. i'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong i was.

&#x200b;

i told her this when i went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. she also filled me on the modeling thing. she doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200b;

first off its not as glamours as i thought it was

&#x200b;

she said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200b;

she works as a model because of a few accidents. she was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. thats all it took for her to be a model. it took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. she started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. she feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. she said being called a ""model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by what she is and not who she is. she doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. she doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200b;

she doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. that she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. she doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. she feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. she wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200b;

this is where i lit up and felt i had something to really offer her. i work in finance. go ahead hate me but i do like money. i like to have it, i like to make it, i like the freedom it affords and i like to watch it flow and grow. so i offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. i thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what i know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. we both win. she agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and i will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200b;

finally i asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200b;

i know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. i learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. in the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why i love her. so honestly thank you yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but i needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. is she the better person? yes she is. do i deserve her. no i dont, but i am going to do better. i really do love this woman, i wont ever do this again.",3
"i'm a first nations elder, i want to tell my story.. i wanted to tell my story on the internet, because my grandson has recently been diagnosed with depression, i don't mean to try offend anyone or hurt anyone, i simply want to tell my story.

&#x200b;

my name is john, and i used to live on a reserve in northern alberta, i'm 52, and i was lucky enough to never go to a residential school, 

&#x200b;

my family didn't have much money, same as all of us on the reserve, i grew up playing outdoors, damming up creeks with rocks, and clay that we scooped out with spoons, my mother was a hard working woman, she cooked us 3 meals a day, and spent most of her time making sure our house was presentable. she would always say that there's no point in moping around and trashing our house, it was truly all we had to be completely honest, 

&#x200b;

both of my parents were alcoholics, my dad especially, no matter what my mother did to make the house presentable, the living room would never stop smelling of cigarettes and beer, my father was mean when he was drunk, i don't think he knew what he was doing either, his eyes almost changed color from when he was drunk and not drunk, there was sometimes violence, and i had my fair share of it, i still have nightmares about it to the day,

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i was strangely whimsical about my culture, if you've ever watched the movie smoke signals, i was a lot like thomas, i thought that everything had a story to tell, it does too. if you stand near the water it'll tell you it's story. you can't understand it, but you've just gotta listen. i would never hurt animals that weren't the fish, i couldn't stand seeing a deer's eyes as it bled out, animals have a story too. you can see it in the way they walk, and in the color of their coat. 

&#x200b;

when i grew to be a teenager, i became extremely self-destructive. i had a girlfriend that equally complimented my problems with more of her own, the first time i became blackout drunk was at the age of 13. i remember waking up the next morning on my girlfriends lawn, standing up, feeling the blood rush to my head, the feeling of flight, and then falling back down and vomiting all over my clothes, i went inside and she had done the same thing. 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

the feeling of being drunk my first time was almost breathtaking for me, it felt like everything wrong flew away and i was capable of doing anything, 

&#x200b;

the occasional drinking turned into alcoholism, and that turned into many stupid decisions, at the age of 17, me and my girlfriend were drunk driving, i crashed into a boulder on the side of the road, my girlfriend made it out with minor injuries and a broken leg, i got out with shattered ribs, a broken arm, and a broken collarbone,

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

my destructive habits continued into my 20s, when i was 23 i decided to stop drinking, leave my girlfriend, and try start a new life, 

&#x200b;

i moved away, lived well for a year, and then fell into a horrible depression, i felt like all i needed was a chance to go home, after that i went back home, 

&#x200b;

i took long walks around the mountains where i lived, i came to peace with myself and those around me, after a few years, reconciling with my father and mother, i left, and started working for construction in british columbia, where i remain to this day.

&#x200b;

tldr asked an old friend to stop being so handsy with my boyfriend, she took it the wrong way and told a common friend i got no business telling her what to do since i owe her so much

&#x200b;

my boyfriend is having sex with her.

a friend convinced some other friends to send me prints of texts between themselves and either my bf or ""best friend"".

they are pretty clear.

i confronted my bf, he looked lost, said he loves me and it was just sex. he says ""jessie""kept throwing herself at him, teasing him, and he said he didn't like her but i still wanted to hang.

he said he just had sex with her to see if she would move on and leave him alone, and that it only happened a couple of times. says he wont do it anymore, he doesn't even like her, he loves me, asking me to please forgive him.

from the texts, once i finally made it through them all, i think that jessie went to the party (where me and bf met) cause she wanted to hook up with him. she had it bad for him, but he didn't feel the same way. she was trying to get him to break up with me, and then to get me to break up with him.

it worked. as of yesterday he is a single man.

in some of those texts, they are talking about some of the hook ups. i feel like throwing up.

i blocked him, cause he was still trying to get in touch.

i ghosted her. but she just sent me a message saying she just heard what happened and ""you know this was probably for the best right?"" and i feel like fucking screaming.

i don't know if this is an update or just me venting.

thanks for listening either way.

edit

i don't wanna sound melodramatic or sappy or anything, but you all brought me to tears.

we keep hearing about how it is insanity to rely on the internet for personal connections, but i just lost a boyfriend, a best friend, and a whole group of friends.. and instead of feeling alone, i am more and more feeling like ""fuck yeah that was the right thing to do, i will be ok"".  it still hurts. but not as much as it would had i really been alone.

i can't even begin to thank this sub.

i really don't know what to say.

even on my previous posts that didn't get as many responses, it was some of the comments there that made me approach the cheating thing knowing i had to break up and move on. so it changed my life in this moment. and considering i will be doing a lot of soul searching on toxic relationships, this probably changed my life for good.

so thank you all so much for reaching out to a stranger. this community is so precious!

and i got a gold, i don't even know what to say! thank you so much! i don't mean to sound ungrateful, but i don't even know how much a gold costs, and this is an alt account, so it wont really be used. is there any way i can return it to the sender? 

some of you are asking for an update. i might in a while, if there is something new to tell. right now it's just more of the same.

i don't think i will be able to answer all the comments, but i am trying to at least answer the ones with questions!

"for saying no when a child i didn't know asked if she could play with my sons bike.. this is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and i'm fed up of being called an asshole so i'm going to ask on here. 

we are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. my 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. they were pretty close by. 

my son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. he had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

when we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. my mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blase attitude towards belongings and she's lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn't attached to material things.

i interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl 'why don't you ask (my son) since it's his bike?' she did and my son said no. she looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn't seem bothered afterwards. 

my entire family looked at my like i was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. 

i got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and i was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son 'honey, sometimes it's nice to share' because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it's his new toy and he shouldn't be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

"for telling a coworker that the office is not a daycare center?. i work for a local government office, in a large complex with a whole lot of people. when their kids are sick or when they don't have a sitter for their kids, they take the day off from the substantial leave that we're allowed per year. my entitled coworker feels that when she doesn't have a sitter, it's perfectly fine to just bring her 5 year old in with her for the entire day. the kid ""camps out"" under this coworkers desk, laying on the floor, being constantly told to ""ssssh"" and left to amuse herself with an ipad and toys. this coworker also does not ask our supervisor beforehand if it's alright to do this, she just brings the kid in. 

also, when she has her kid here, numerous people come over to our office to chat and coddle the kid and ""meet"" the kid and baby talk the kid and it's really disturbing when you're trying to concentrate on writing or creating graphics for a project.

**2018 year in review:**

- earned all-time high annual net income

- invested 50% of my net income this year, setting new records for both cumulative (total dollars) and quantitative (% of net income) annual investing rate. running annual average rate is 30%.

- spent 25% net income on living expenses, 25% on recreational expenses, 0% on debt this year. running annual average rates are now 35%, 24%, 10% respectively.

- suffered significant damage to my average roi (-37%) thanks to crypto market volatility

- net worth flat lined this year as decreasing value of taxable assets were offset by increasing estimated present value of pension.

**2019 goals:**

- invest 45% of my net income.

- spend 25% of my net income on recreational/fun activities.

- keep living expenses below 30% of my net income.

"my(39m) daughter (16f) came out today and my wife(39f) cannot take it.. this is very embarrassing to put up on my original account so please excuse me for posting from a new account.

we have been married for 17 years, together since high school. we have three children - a son and two daughters (17m,16f&12f). we all have an amazing relationship and we are super close with our children. 

next week we are hosting a dinner for a special occasion. everyone from our families is invited. my son's girlfriend is invited too.

so, yesterday my daughter (16f) wanted to talk to me and my wife privately. she basically told us that she was gay and we were the only people she confessed to. she wanted to invite her girlfriend over for the dinner. i must admit that i felt happy because my daughter chose to confide in us. the fact that she was comfortable talking to us about it made me proud. somehow it made me feel like a good father. 

i reassured her that it was not something to be ashamed of and she would have our full support. this is when my wife exploded. she yelled at my daughter that she was 16 and she's just confused. she asked her she should date boys first because she can't claim to be gay without going out with boys. she also told her that no one in our families is gay( this isn't true and i'll elaborate on this later) and there was zero possibility of my daughter being one. she told her that she was not allowed to meet this girl and she didn't want freaks in her house. 

i was so angry at this point. my daughter was crying and apologizing for letting us down. i basically told my wife to keep her bigoted views to herself and took my daughter out for some alone time. i just reassured her that i would always support her every decision and be there for her and she could talk to me about anything. after we got home she went straight to bed. 

my wife didn't want to talk and told me that i loved my daughter more than her. she told me that she was the one who supported me through all my struggles and was always there for me. after that she just told me that she'd divorce me if i encouraged freaks. i was so taken aback by her behavior. this was totally out of character for her. 

now, before painting my wife as homophobic, i think i know where this is coming from. her brother came out to their family as gay. his parents supported his decision but he ended up taking his life because he was bullied. none of the children kniw about this and it was a very traumatic incident for her family. i asked her if thus was about her brother and she told me that he was nuts and refuses to talk to me.

how do i approach this. i want to be there for my daughter but i want my family. i want my wife to accept my daughter's choices. i feel like she just gave me an ultimatum. how do i make things better?

edit1: some of you have asked if this was the first time my wife expressed her views on homosexual people. no. we have friends who are gay and she was totally fine with them. 

edit2:she loved her brother and was shaken by his death. i'm not privy to the exact details because no one in her family is comfortable discussing that but i know that he took his life because he was bullied. so my wife thinks that my daughter has to endure all this and she's upset. 

edit3: and no. we are not doing any conversion therapy or anything like that. i will stand by my daughter alone if necessary.

"circumcising males when they're infants should be illegal. i've never met a person who agrees with me and it's infuriating.. i think it's barbaric. the foreskin is there to protect the glans. and as an infant it is literally fused to the head of the penis. so as a newborn, males have their foreskin ripped off the head of the penis and then cut off around the rim, sometimes with no anesthetic. and idk how you care for an open wound while keeping them in diapers that will eventually smear them in shit. 

it breaks my heart that my fiance wants any future boys we have to be circumcised. and his only reason is ""i want him to look like me"". i've told him i want him there to watch and listen to his newborn cry and scream from being mutilated for cosmetic reasons. i told him he will be the only one changing his diapers and treating the wound. 


""it's gross lol"" because you've grown up in a culture that has done this since biblical times. 

it is the exact equivalent of cutting off a baby girl's labia. oh, it's for aesthetics. oh, it will make girls less prone to utis. oh, it'll eliminate smegma that builds up between the folds. oh, it'll expose a mucus membrane and desensitize the clit. oh, it'll make them less likely to get labia cancer. oh, it'll prevent stds because there's less folds for the disease to hide in.

every ""benefit"" of circumcision is a matter of hygiene and the same ""benefits"" would apply to girls who get their labia cut off.

i'm terrified i won't be able to do these things and i'll just end up as isolated loner who is in constant pain. this is a route i'm sure to go down if i continue being like this so i want to change. 

here's hoping i'm successful in doing so. 
i don't have a single friend online or in real life so i'll have to keep a clear head a remind myself why i'm doing it: 'so i don't become the isolated loner who dies alone without ever having a happy life'

"update to ""i am 25 and getting married. dealing with issue around picking my ""maid of honor"" for my wedding. friends women in their 20s think my brother 35/m is a bad choice"". previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/)

&#x200b;

i am so thankful for all of your comments - i read every single one of them! 

&#x200b;

so, what happened? well, i realized that it is my wedding. my fiance fully understood my position and really likes my brother and thought it was a great idea. i organized a brunch with my current bridesmaids to explain my position and why i did what i did. i realized that it's a story i've told but didn't talk about with my friends, i thought it was abundantly clear that being 'different' from my family made it obvious. 

&#x200b;

the brunch was interesting. what i didn't mention in my last post was that the person who raised the most fuss was also someone who seemed to get the other people going more than they otherwise would have. we met for a lovely brunch at a nice place (my treat, too!) and i raised the issue once more. the person who was most ""disgusted"" by it, ""ms. x"" again raised her objection. she was furious and said that this was a travesty and tried to rally the other girls. this time, there wasn't as much of a reaction and the others sort of just didn't care. i told them all why i wanted to honor my brother and why it was so important to me and ms. x admitted that it was lovely and touching but it should be her because *it's her business!* turns out that she wanted to be moh and was going behind my back to get the other girls to drop-out of contention so that she could do it so she could plan the wedding and thus could be moh/wedding planner and this would be for her business. i was a bit... surprised. ms. x was so upset that she threatened to drop out of the bridal party altogether if this went further. brunch was tense after she left but the consensus was, the other girls wanted her gone and i didn't want her around anymore either, so she's no longer being included (i will send her an invite). 

&#x200b;

that meant i had to speak to my brother. as i mentioned he's a doctor and has a dual practice, so i swung by his office and texted him that i really needed to talk. he misinterpreted my comments so he kept the office open late and his secretary/nurse/wife let me in. i went into his office and he was immediately worried i was sick, but i told him what had happened and why ms. x dropped out and that i wanted him to be my ""man of honor"". he was totally surprised and confused. he asked if i was sure and that i really shouldn't feel compelled which is when i began crying (i had so much pent up emotion) so he made me laugh which meant i was snorting-laugh-crying which is my usual. he said he would be delighted but wasn't really good at bridal showers so he would need help. 

&#x200b;

we arranged a time for all the bridesmaids to come together and meet the man of honor so we are having a bbq at my parent's place this weekend. my mom and dad are so happy that he's involved - my dad is walking me down the aisle and my brother will stand at the end. my brother offered a very very generous gift towards paying for the wedding so not only is he standing as the moh but is paying about 1/3 of the wedding. we're really, really excited. 

&#x200b;

interesting story: one of the bridesmaids actually knows my brother - this bridesmaid and i were friends at college and lived away for a while. while visiting home she developed some sort of nasty infection and was directed from a walk-in clinic to an emergency room where my brother attended to her and got her on her way. so there's a weird personal connection that they can talk about when they meet ""hey, you lanced something somewhere! glad to meet you again!""

"i think i've fallen in love with my girlfriend? i need some advice.. so full disclaimer: i'm 29, and i don't think i've ever been in love before.

i've been dating my girlfriend for the past 4 months or so. the first month or 2 i knew her, she wasn't sure if she was ready for a relationship due to bad break ups, so we had a bit of a rocky start where neither of us were sure where we were going, or what we were doing. but we continued to hang out, have fun together, until one day she asked me if it would be alright if she started calling me her boyfriend.

fast forward to today - despite our busy schedules we still manage to see each other every other day. i've met almost all her friends, and some of which i consider my friends now as well! i get along with her whole group, and she gets along great with my friends. we have many overlapping interests and activities which makes things amazingly fun when we get together. she spends the night frequently. i've met her parents and family, she has met mine. we both cheesily admitted we wished we could see each other every day.

the other day i was running my hands through her hair while we were falling asleep, just admiring everything about her. when suddenly, a realization dawned on me: ""i think i love her"".

the problem is, i've never experienced ""love"", i'm not sure what it is, or what it's supposed to feel like if that makes any sense? what i do know is i've never felt like this about any girl before. i never get tired of her - her corny jokes, her silly laugh, her competitive drive. even her ""faults"" or ""negative"" traits i find endearing. i want to see her always, and i think about her a lot. is this love?

i haven't said anything yet to her for 2 reasons.

1.) i want to be absolutely certain i love her before i say anything.

2.) it might be too soon to say it? 4 months is not a long time - and she has a history of bad ex's that ended horribly, which made her slow to open up in the first place. for her to ask me if it's okay if she calls me her boyfriend was a big thing for her, so i imagine something like love is probably something even more difficult.

am i in love? and if i am, should i say anything?

**edit:** wow this blew up... there's so much advice in here, and i don't have time to read through it all right now, but i wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to drop a few words of wisdom my way. i really appreciate it! i think for right now, it seems like waiting for the time being is the best. and to echo as others have said, i think i'll show it, rather than speak it. i don't want to put undue pressure on us, or her, and i'd like her to be absolutely comfortable. thanks again everyone!! <3 i guess whenever it does eventually come out, i'll post an update.",7

after some time, she was explaining a question which got the majority of the class. it was a cupboard supported by a nail which is against a wall. the following question was ""how much weight can the cupboard support before it falls?"" it was a multiple choice question with the answers being something around 12kg, 22kg, 220kg and 2200kg. it was 220kg.

my friend was really bugged about it and proceeded to rant to me about it. keep in mind, i was not paying attention at all towards her or the question as i was a dumb idiot trying to understand simple questions.

friend: this doesn't make any sense. from my point of view, a cupboard can't hold that much.

me: it's physics, what else do you expect.

friend: a nail can't withstand that much weight.

me: it kind of did for jesus.

"my smug friend is getting a karma smack down and i struggle to care.. let's call her sharon. 

sharon talks all the time about her perfect marriage and how her husband knows he's not good enough for her, so he would never do anything to screw it up. 

meanwhile, she treats him like crap. when they're together, she mostly just orders him around. but the vast majority of the time, she's out having cocktails with friends while he's at home with their kids. 

he's a musician, which she thinks is ""daaaarling"" but she's not interested in it. still, she likes for him to be in a band because then he wants to hang out with her less. 

last year, sharon met this woman... we'll call her chloe. sharon likes chloe alright, but sharon's husband thinks chloe is awesome. 

anyway, about 6 months ago, sharon was giggling with me and a few other ladies at brunch about how now she barely ever has to do anything with her husband... instead, she just asks chloe to hang out with him and everything is fine. 

we pointed out the obvious issues with that. especially since chloe is beautiful, single and an easy ten years younger than us. she's a singer/songwriter and they share a ton of other interests. and look, i'm not suggesting men and women can't be friends... but sharon openly admits that she almost never sleeps with her husband and now she thinks it's a good idea to encourage him to have a close friendship with a woman he's almost certainly attracted to?  just because she wants to keep him occupied?

ok then. good luck with that. 

yesterday, i had to stop at sharon's to pick up some things my daughter left over there.  she told me to just walk in because she wasn't home. i did as she said and there was chloe with sharon's husband... fucking in the living room, full view of the front door.

i tried doing some research, as it is an independently owned complex within a strata. there wasn't much to find. i called the human rights board in town, they told me i had a case. i called the tenancy branch and they informed me that i was not covered under the tenancy act, as, for the 8 days out of the month he stays here, we share a bathroom and kitchen.

he asked for the rent money early, two days ago. i was hesitant to, but obliged. that's biting me in the ass right now. he was fined 550$ for allowing to me to reside in the complex with a child, and is being asked to leave as well. he blames me for this, and refuses to refund next months rent because the fine is ""my fault for not keeping that damn thing quiet"". he knew full well that i had a young daughter (and a cat), though i was assured by him before moving in that neither would be an issue.

what do i do as far as legal recourse?

remorse: not all days, but most my teeth hurt and i have no way to stop the pain. i live in the usa and cannot afford insurance to get it fixed. if i had the money to get them all pulled and replaced i would, but the dental place told me it would cost over $7,000.

my life has been going well for the most part lately and i feel horrible for even thinking of wanting to die to escape the pain. i have 2 kids that need me and a family that loves me, but love doesn't buy new teeth.

i did it to myself back in highschool by throwing up after each meal. i don't smile often and when i actually do i have to cover my mouth because i don't want others to be grossed out by my teeth. most of the time i just grin to the right side. my kids don't like me going to their school, meeting their friends and teachers because they are embarrassed of my mouth. i try not to show it, but that hurts more than the physical pain i endure from the infection that is spreading.

anyways, thanks for taking time to read this and i hope that you (the reader) live in a country that would help with dental problems.

edit: after all the kind words and great advice people have given me, plus the top commenter with their generous offer. i want to say i never expected such great responses, didn't actually think people would respond at all. he is my x-ray i got a few months ago, of my teeth, for free. it is pretty disgusting(http://i.imgur.com/d9ob5yt.jpg\))

here is a regular pic of my teeth as of tonight. it's nasty so look at your own risk(http://i.imgur.com/ehwhweb.jpg\))

edit 2: wow, i got gold for this? that's crazy. i have had a couple of offers and am very grateful for each and everyone of them. i am just as grateful for the kind words and advice people have given me. i am longing for the day that i can share before and after pics.

edit 3: i set up a fundraiser, even though i still feel weird about it. it would help /u/sushiandwow out since the offered to pay for it. fundraiser link(http://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/xd57/dakota-s-mouth-restoration-)

edit 4: i have received an offer from a specialist in fl and am in talks with him to fix my problem. all money will be going towards the trip, but if i have any extra i will be giving it to others that have similar problems.

edit 5: here is a picture of the consultation worksheet(http://i.imgur.com/gb91a4w.jpg) i got back during the free exam. also, i read each and every message and i try to respond to them all. if i don't respond to you i am sorry.

update 1/10/2015: the operation is planned for the first week of february. i want to thank /u/sushiandwow, /u/danhook and everyone else that has made this possible. i have received just over $2,700 so far and it still amazes me each day. i cannot wait to show off my new teeth to the whole world. i have an idea about how i am going to be giving away the extra money and plan on including some of my own tax money as well. again, thanks to everyone that donated, sent words of encouragement and even shared their own stories.",12
"""anonymous sources"" is just a way for the media to literally get away with fake news and face no repercussions.. i'm really sick and tired of the whole ""according to anonymous sources"" thing in news media and i just immediately shut down whenever i hear it now. i lost all faith in the media in 2014, and part of it had to do the with outlandish headline and ridiculous article which was all according to ""anonymous sources"". this is just a way for profit-driven corporate media  to get away with generating literal fake news to get clicks and face no backlash because they're not legally required to disclose their sources if they wish to remain anonymous. i also think this is a major problem with the western world that needs to be addressed moving forward. people as a whole need to stand up and say that they won't accept this garbage anymore. i think all news from corporate media should need a disclaimer that ""x news agency is a for-profit entity"" so people are reminded that these companies make money off of your outrage.",6

"if i reported this woman?. i was on a call with my sister, who was giving me some usual gossip about people we know from back home, when she tells me about a family friend dina who has just recently become sexually active with her boyfriend. i asked my sister how she knew dina was sexually active, and she told me she heard it from my mom. 

i know that dina is super private and comes from a really conservative household, and wouldn't dare tell her parents about her being sexually active. i asked my sister how my mom knew, and apparently my mom's best friend, let's call her miss annie (not dina's mother) is very good friends with dina's pcp, who told her the gossip. i work in healthcare, and i feel like this has to be a hipaa violation, so i told my sister i might have to report dina's pcp. 

if i report her? my sister told me i shouldn't because ""you'll be ruining that doctor's life and her family over 'just a bit of gossip'"" (she has two small children and is in the process of moving her husband over to the us from abroad) and that i should just ""mind my own business."" my best friend (who also knows dina well) said that i don't have any proof to report her over just ""hearsay"" and ""gossip."" however this situation isn't sitting right with me.

edit: hey guys! so after heavy consideration, i scheduled a three way call between my sister, dina and i to talk about this. i'll keep you all updated! thanks for all your input everyone :)

edit 2: hi guys! sorry for the lack of update (mods turned me down) just wanted to update you all - turns out that dina did tell her doctor about it.... in confidence at a family friend's party where miss annie happened to be eavesdropping on. long story short, dina's mom had an angry conversation with miss annie and told her essentially to ""get a life"" and to ""stop gossiping about other people's children."" i'm happy i told dina first and didn't report that doctor. thanks guys!",3

"for being too honest about having a baby?. so as i write this i'm feeding my 7 week old son. i am totally in love with him, he is amazing. however... the process of bringing him into the world was not good. at. all.

in order to explain why i might be an asshole i think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.

i had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that i weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before i conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). i could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and i got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.

then came labour and delivery. i was in labour for 92 hours. my son was back to back, so i was in agony. i had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. in the end his heart rate dropped and i had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.

i ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. my son was ill following delivery and ended up in the nicu for a few days. i had issues breastfeeding once he was out of nicu, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. i spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.

once home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.

he's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.




so why aita?

well, before i got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. which, pardon my french, is bollocks. i still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe i could mentally deal with another pregnancy.

part of the reason i think i have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues i had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. nobody told me that everything can go wrong. i didn't expect my birth plan to go as i hoped, but i thought i might get some things i wanted. i never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. i didn't prepare for him being ill. i didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.

so when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, i was totally honest.

i didn't sugar coat anything. i explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. i have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, i probably won't be doing it again.

well my friends have said that i'm an asshole for being so honest as i've put them off having children in the future. i didn't mean to scare them, but i felt that i would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.

i don't feel like i should apologise or say that i exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe i'm wrong.

"by eating oreos and making my mom think she was going crazy.. this happened around 2010 when i was roughly 24 years old. i still lived at home with my mom who always had a sweet tooth. now, by this time she was suffering from some early onset dementia and did not work, so she had a lot of time on her hands. she liked to call customer service numbers and give them a hard time about little things for some human interaction, in my opinion. she had been calling nabisco several times about her opening brand new oreo packages and finding the center row of the tray  almost completely devoid of oreos. i knew this because she had mentioned it and would leave notes from her phone calls around. i rolled my eyes as i was used to her being a little nutty. according to her, it kept happening and she began taking photos of the oreos each time it happened to try to prove to nabisco that she wasn't making this up. i assumed she was eating them and forgetting.  one day, i'm in the kitchen and i open up a brand new package of oreos and grab several from the center row.  as i start walking away, it hit finally hit me! she didn't realize that oreo had updated their packaging to having the easy open pull tab on the top! she was still opening the side of the package and sliding the tray out. i was the oreo thief the whole time and didn't know it! we had a good laugh over it. my mom died shortly thereafter in january 2012 and my sister bought me an oreo christmas ornament. i smile as i recall the oreo incident when i decorate my tree each year. 

tl;dr - i was using the new easy open pull tab on the top of oreo packages while my mom was still opening the package from the side and sliding the tray out which led to her thinking nabisco was shorting us oreos.",4
"by gluing my ass cheeks together before a long awaited date. so there is this girl who lives a state away from me, and she had been planning to come visit me for three months. the plan was for her to come over when i got off work at 930am. 

i had worked three overnights in a row and i didn't have time to clean my apartment or get myself ready for her visit in the days prior due to being exhausted and/or at work.

flash forward to this morning. i get off work around 825 and have an hour to get home and get ready before she gets there. 

i made it home and had 30 mins to spare. i decided that at most i needed 5 mins to shower so i figured i had time to clean up a little bit. as i'm finishing cleaning, about to get in the shower, she texts me and says she will be 15-20 minutes late. (this is where the cascading failures begin).

15-20 mins isn't a lot of time, but i thought it was enough to get my downstairs trimmed up, just in case things got physical. 

at first i tried to use an electric razor and it was going pretty well. it quickly turned to shit and cut my right nut twice in like 10 seconds. i decided that there is no way i could finish this without my manhood looking like a murder scene. 

i was panicking and had no idea what to do, seeing as she'd be there in less than 10 minutes and my undercarriage was in shambles. i went to put my razor away under the sink and noticed a box of self waxing strips that my friend had left behind when she was helping me wax my back. perfect.

i didn't have time to read the directions, so i ripped to strips open and place them both into the middle of the jungle down there. i went to pull the first strip off and was greeted with extreme resistance and searing pain. once again, i was too committed to not finishing and time was running out. i made the decision to rip the second strip off and just jump in the shower and hope that the encounter didn't turn physical.

as soon as i go to wash the wax from my nether regions i realize that an enormous amount of extremely sticky wax is still all over my crack. i frantically try every soap i had in my shower to get it off. i even tried to use a coffee ground face mask (that was unpleasant).

at this point, somehow the wax sticky factor had quadrupled and i was 2 minutes away from her arrival. 

i said fuck it and dried off and got dressed. 

she called me to say she was here and i got up to answer the door, when i realized that my boxers were stuck to my ass and that my ass cheeks were firmly stuck together. no time to figure it out now. 

we chatted for a while and things ended up moving into a physical direction. she could tell that i was wincing in pain when i moved around and she kept asking what was wrong. i played it off as muscle cramps.

this worked fine until she went to take off my boxers and could feel the resistance of the wax glue from my cheeks and crack.

she immediately looked concerned and i had no choice but to tell her what had gone down moments before her arrival. it has been a long time since i've been that embarrassed. 
 
the kicker is that once she stopped hysterically laughing at me, she pointed out that the wax kit comes with after wax removal wipes that i had failed to see during my frantic decision to wax in the first place.


tl,dr: i accidentally glued my ass cheeks together with a cheap self waxing kit, moments before a girl came over and i couldn't get the wax off my ass before she got there.

edit: sorry y'all, i fell asleep after typing this. didn't know so many people needed closure. i was successful in the mission with ""my rear flank exposed."" my ass cheeks got stuck to the sheets more than a few times and more than a few more hairs were removed that way, but all in all it went relatively well considering the circumstances.

edit 2: changed the infamous ""his"" to the proper pronoun. sorry to ruin the conspiracy theories

edit 3: yes, for all of those interested, we had sex and i am seeing her again today. also, i was talking to my best friend on snapchat during the whole process and have a video of my reaction to the first strip being removed. i can post the link if anyone wants proof this happened

edit: i just want to clear up some very wrong misconceptions.

i do not think about this girl all the time. i looked her up out of morbid curiosity just to see where she was in life and saw that she was in jail. 

i have suffered a lot of depression in my life because of her (and several other factors) and i maintain what i said in my post. nothing anyone says will change that. 

i have gone to therapy and been on medication, and had a lot of counseling to deal with my problems. i am not miserable. i am not angry anymore. but i have no intentions and zero desire to ever forgive her. i will never forgive someone who drove me to try and kill myself.

i am happy where i am in my life. i have two awesome jobs and the love of my life. she and i have raised my little sister together and soon her (my sister) 15th birthday is going to be here. i don't think about my bully all the time nor do i simmer in hatred and anger towards her as so many of you seem to think.

she is a total piece of shit who drove me to attempt suicide several times and i am well within my rights to wish that she meets a negative and miserable end. that doesn't mean i think about her day in and day out.

"i have a girlfriend and a daughter, and i'm terrified.. **edit:** oh wow, i truly wasn't expecting this when i posted it. i was just feeling so...i don't even know what, and i just wrote away. i want you guys to know that i'm truly blown away by these comments and advices, and i wish i could answer all of you. thank you so much for all the kind words, the gold, the advices and the heartwarming pms. i haven't told marion about this post yet, but i certainly told our baby, she of course just looked at me confused but it's our secret for now.

---

i don't know what this is, i don't know if it's a confession or a love letter or both, but for the first time, i'm terrified of everything. every little thing poses a danger and i know it's not true, but i'm so scared of losing what i have now that logic doesn't work with my brain, it seems.

i'm a 28 year old male. 

when i was young i fell for one of my dearest friends. we sort of grew up together, and then we dated and it didn't work out. i thought she'd forever be the love of my life. then, i met another girl and while i loved her, it wasn't the same thing. we dated for a long while and then broke up. i tried giving it another shot with my friend, but there were complications from both our sides. both of these relationships were long and while i've had hookups here and there, i'm the kind of guy who enjoys being in a relationship.

so i spent a good time alone. from 26 to 27. i'm still friends with both my ex-girlfriends and occasional hookups with them would happen, but i never went back to dating either of them. 

then i met her. i'll call her marion here. she came into my life out of nowhere--we met at around 4 am when we both went out to the same convenience store. i remember seeing her grabbing a box of cereal next to me, and i couldn't stop staring. she was gorgeous, the kind of gorgeous you need to tell yourself not to drop your jaw. her hair goes down to her waist, and she's got these hazel eyes that are cat like and that day she was wearing a black dress with a black robe over it,  a black robe full of pink roses and i know i'm sounding stupid, but i was just attracted to her for some reason, like she was pulling me in. i stared like a dumbass and she noticed and sort of laughed, shook her head and stepped in front of me to grab the box she wanted. i told her without thinking that i liked those cereals, too, and i think i cringed at that but she was nice about it. she started talking to me, and we paid for our stuff and sat on the parking lot there, eating cereal right out of the box. that's one of my favorite memories with her because it looks like a scene out of a movie or a book and it was the first time we met. we exchanged numbers and over the weeks, we started talking more and more. by the end of the first month of our friendship, i was completely and utterly infatuated with her, and luckly for me, she was too. we started dating and i fell in love with her so quickly and so hard. you ever met someone that seems to have been made especially for you? we fit together. it's the best way i can explain it, we fit together. even when we fight, even when we're mad at each other, this entire relationship still feels right. 

so things progressed and she got pregnant. it was an accidental pregnancy. right when the symptoms started to show, we both knew what it meant. we were terrified, and i went to buy a pregnancy test with her. when that thing turned out to be positive, we were still terrified but happy, too. some people were really against it, some talked about us being young. i was about to turn 28 then, she was 24. we had already decided on keeping the baby and nothing anyone said made any difference. we moved in together, and had a healthy baby.

and now here we are, and the reason i'm here is because i realized last night how scared i am. it was raining really hard, and the baby was crying. marion got up to go see what it was, guessing that the baby was hungry. i couldn't go back to sleep, so i went to the nursery where she usually breastfeeds the baby, but they weren't there. i then went to the living room and found marion sitting by the window, watching the rain, breastfeeding our baby girl. she was wearing a similar robe to when we first met, and she looked stunning. the room was quiet except for the sound of the rain, and it was honestly the most beautiful thing i've ever seen and it was mine, you know, my family. i quietly made my way to them and sat in front of her. she smiled at me and put her feet on my lap, and we stayed like that until our daughter was done feeding. and i realized that i could lose this, i could lose this as quickly as i gained it and that thought made me go numb. i love that woman more than anything, i love our daughter more than anything, i love us, i love our story and i want to protect them from everything and the fact that i can't is making me go insane. i get anxious when she's out and takes too long to come home because i think something happened, i get these intrusive thoughts all the time. my confession is that i think i'm experiencing real love even though i thought i'd loved before and i have a tendecy to lose people i love. i'm truly scared here and i don't know how to keep that anxiety down. it might be because we're parents now, but even before our baby i was terrified of losing marion. 

i wish i could predict every danger in the world to keep them away from it.",12

i paired up with another guy, and we both slacked off quite a bit. it was maybe a week before the due date of the project when i asked an acquaintance if i could see his code for the project to get a better understanding of how to do it. i ended up copying/pasting almost the whole thing while only changing variable names for the most part. dumb, i know, but it was crunch time and i was desperate.

everyone turns in their project work and we end up taking our final exam. at the beginning of the exam the professor asks for a laundry list of people to come speak to him after they complete the exam including myself and my partner. turns out over half the class (20+ people) ended up doing the same thing - but here's the kicker - my partner shared our code with another group who in turn shared it with yet another and so on. half the class turned in code that i originally copied from one group and we were all in trouble.

my partner didn't know where i got the code from and thought i wrote it and apologized profusely for sharing it and took the fall. half the class failed because of this including the group i originally copied the code from. because my partner took complete responsibility, the professor and the dean of the department asked me to provide a statement so they could add it to the case which i did. i was absolved of any wrongdoing and received an a for the project while everyone else failed and had to retake the class next semester. the guy who i originally copied the code from knew what was up and hated me afterward but couldn't do anything about it until it was far too late and the case was shut.",12

"ia ex-wife opened a credit card in my name now won't pay the $5000+ balance. my ex and i divorced three years ago and have no children together. i was ordered to pay alimony for two years and my payments stopped in march 2018. my ex also got the house in the divorce.

in april 2018, it looks like a credit card was opened in my name with the address of my former house, where we lived while we were together. i had literally no knowledge of the card or anything about it. the first i learned of it was last week when i was served and given a court date in july. i'm being sued by the credit card company for the balance and lawyer fees. looking through the documents, it's clear as day she was the one who opened the card. i texted her telling her she needed to pay it and she at first acted like she didn't know what i was talking about. she finally admitted that she opened the card because she felt that i was still responsible for upkeep on the house and her car after the alimony ended. she said her mom told her it would be fine.

i have literally nothing to do with her, the house, or her car any longer. the last thread connecting us was snipped after my alimony payments ended. obviously she has some issues but do i need to get a lawyer for my court date?",2
"if you think that certain fashion ads should be banned because the models are unhealthily skinny, then you should also apply that logic to obese models.. a bunch of ads for something called nasty girl were pulled in europe because the models were deemed too skinny. so fucking what? if people are so weak minded that they can't make their own health decisions, i think we should just let darwinism run its course.

&#x200b;

how many people are dying from being too thin versus too fat? how much more dangerous for the average person is diabetes, poor cardiovascular health, higher blood pressure, higher risk of stroke, knee injuries, etc. than taking in too few calories? it's inconceivable to me that on average, the effects  of glamorizing thin women would be worse than the opposite - people are fatter than ever, and most people could use a push towards less body fat, whereas helping people disregard the negative health impact of being obese is damaging for society.

&#x200b;

people should be able to employ whatever models they want, and consumers should be able to read the ads they want, but lets not act like models being thin is worse for young women than models that are morbidly obese. sure, it's bad for the models themselves, but if you aren't comfortable with the line of work, do something else.

"- parents lost all my uni work two days before my deadline. this is literally happening right now and i'm not sure how i feel or if i'm being an arsehole here, i'm feeling many emotions right now...

for some context, i had a university deadline last friday, and another university application deadline this friday.

when i moved out a few years ago my parents insisted on keeping all my college and university so they could keep it safe, i thought fair enough, they have a much bigger house and the space available to keep everything in one place and safe. since then, extensive clearing out has occurred at my parents house.

fast forward to last month and i let my mum know that i would be needing my sketchbooks from my uni work in order to apply onto master programmes. i keep mentioning it and she keeps saying she'll get dad to look in the attic for them. this sunday comes round, i go over to pick them up and no one has looked for them yet. 


last night they let me know that they can't find anything. they've found my brothers stuff and a lot of scrappy stuff but nothing that resembles three years of university work...


long story short, my parents have basically lost my uni work, my application to these other universities is now compromised, mum is saying i need to sort this out myself now as she thinks i've given them a hard time

am i the asshole?


edit 1: thankyou to everyone who had commented, i will include a bit more info below as i've seen a few re-occuring comments.

1. i don't live at home, and i contacted my parents a month prior to the deadline, and kept reminding until i could get home. 

2. when at home i had searched the house with no luck, my parents said they had put everything in the attic for safe keeping - the attic doesn't have a drop down ladder and unless you're over 6ft like my dad, it's impossible to get inside. my work was apparently somewhere i could not physically get to. 

3. im an architecture student, and whilst i do have digital presentation sheets, the emphasis of the interview is sketchbooks, hand drawn sheets and models - which i found trashed in the attic (the models). 

4. my parents have not apologised or spoken to me since wednesday and my deadline is today. 

5. my portfolio was planned out way before the deadline, i had the sheets on photoshop set up with all the titles and annotations, all i needed was my sketchbooks, models and larger drawings to take to a plotter (i had an appointment booked) to scan and import.",3

"when i was younger i got somebody expelled from high school and arrested for blackmailing to tell my religious parents i was gay.. when i was younger i was a really mean and angry. my dad used to beat me and i got beat up at school a lot. made me wise up real fast. in that school you couldn't show any weakness because then you'd get beaten up and bullied worse. part of me just functioned i guess on like auto pilot. i'd sometimes do bad things because i felt i had to and thinking back it was messed up, but it's a part of my past now.

i am gay, but nobody knew about it at the time. my family also don't know. they are extreme catholics and if they were to ever find out about it they'd of disowned me i'm pretty sure. my dad would often say how much he hated gay people. it was something i never wanted him to know because he'd hate me and be ashamed if he ever knew.

i ended up having sex at the age of 14. it was with a man who worked at my high school. yes i know it was wrong and messed up, i don't want to go into detail about that though. all that matters is that some kid i was in the same group as once snatched my phone and read my texts. he found out i was gay and started bullying me for it for months. he would tease it and shout it at me when people were around even though i told him to stop. he seemed to want to humiliate me with the information and i tried to explain about my parents to get him to stop, but instead he started blackmailing me saying he was going to tell my parents if i didn't do what he said.

he made me give him my xbox 360, wii and ds. he took all my video games, my bullfrog, i had to keep giving him money and do his homework for him. whenever he wanted something he'd just use that information against me to blackmail me into doing whatever he wanted. he made my life into a living hell. he'd also make me say horrible things to people to make them cry or hate me. the worst thing he did was made me to ask out some ugly fat girl and the dump her immediately after kissing her. i did everything he said because i was so scared of my dad finding out. i even ended up deleting all my social medias and smashing my phone because he'd contact me and it'd make things worse having him messaging me outside of school. i felt like i couldn't tell anyone or get help, he had this one thing to completely hold against me for the rest of my life. at the time i even considered suicide because of him.

after a while i snapped. i plotted to get the kid expelled so i would never see him in school again. i got the man i had been sleeping with to give me $800. i then met with a friend's brother at the time who knew a drug dealer and bought as much cocaine as i physically could. i also bought some knives. i planted it all in that boys bag and when the sniffer dog came through our school they found it on him.

he was immediately expelled and couldn't speak to me outside of school anymore because i had no social medias or mobile for him to contact me through. he got put on some kind of programme for extremely badly behaved kids i think i heard. it was the most ruthless and calculated thing i think i've ever done. i found out later his house was searched and his father was involved with drugs, so it didn't help his case at all. the kid no doubt kept saying he didn't know where the stuff came from and i bet they just saw his druggie dad and didn't believe him.

i didn't feel a shred of guilt when it happened though. i thought he was an idiot for testing me so much and the moment i found out he was expelled i was actually so relieved. as i grew up and matured more i mellowed down a lot. i became kinder. i feel bad for what i did now looking back. i'm sure there was a better way of dealing with the situation than that, i just couldn't think of anything at the time and felt desperate to keep my secret from my family.

all my friends stopped talking to him when he was expelled. my parents never found out my secret. i have since moved away from my home town and family and although life isn't great i'm glad i've moved past such a terrible time in my life. oh if you want to hear an update on the guy who was blackmailing me it turns out he went to prison for raping somebody so i don't feel as bad, but i still feel bad.",12
"by cleaning my ass with a comb.. this happened all of 45 minutes ago, and yes, it still hurts a bit.

to start, some context. i always take incredibly long showers due to me getting sidetracked by random things, such as spinning in circles in order to get an even distribution of hot water, trying to scratch that damn itch, and the fascination that is my penis.

another thing to note is that i always take a comb with me to the shower as i find it helps ""rub in"" the shampoo, except this time, there was a new comb(https://i.imgur.com/mdy4s21.jpg) that i hadn't seen before. 

now that that is out of the way, let's get into the fuck-up. my shower started off as usual, rubbing a bar of soap absolutely everywhere while trying to use my fingernails to carve designs into the bar. after about five or so minutes of soaping, i moved to the hair process, which also went as planned. this is where i dun goofed. upon seeing this new comb, i decided to use it, as it had finer teeth. after using said comb, i realised that it also had a ^^much sharper/thinner handle. 

>the following actions have been made by a fucking idiot, and is nsfw. proceed with caution.

when i saw the handle, for some unknown reason, i built the thought process of ""this handle is so thin, i bed i'd be able to stick it up my ass and not feel it."" was it sensible? no. was there reasoning behind it? nada. was it a good idea? absolutely not.

that thought was immediately followed up with ""why the hell not,"" which was then followed by a comb, of which i had never seen before, going into my ass. now obviously, with nothing ever being in my ass before, there was a small brown patch on the end of the handle upon removal, and for some reason, i got the god awful idea that i should clean the inside of my ass. how, you ask? stab the handle into a bar of fucking soap, of course. 

with the handle now soapy, i returned to my ass and was immediatly greeted with a slight stinging feeling. ""whatever, thats probably the soap cleaning away and is bound to only be temporary,"" i thought. i. was. wrong. the stinging only got worse once i pulled the comb out. i then spent the rest of my shower rubbing my ass in hopes to get rid of the feeling.

fast forward to nearly an hour later and i am still feeling the consequenses of putting a hair product in my arse.

over all, 1/10, would not penetrate again.

>tldr: i stuck a soapy comb handle up my ass in hopes to clean it. not a good idea.

>edit: too many people are reading about me using a comb to sodomize myself, go away!!

>edit #2: my ass feels fine now. i've eaten a massive cheeseburger, however, so the visit to the bathroom later should be interesting.

>edit #3: a lot of you seem to be concerned as to where the comb came from/whos it is, which is so be expected since i forgot to specify that i had bought it a few months ago and only today found it again. no, thankfully, it was no one else's hair product that became my booty stabber. 

>edit #4: #alright, who did it? who guilded the booty stabber?

>edit #5: it was the soap causing the pain (the pain lasted less than 90 minutes), not the comb. the *buttfuck retarded comb abuser lives to shit another day!

>**also, the comb was mine, don't worry. i had bought it a few months ago because of the finer teeth and had forgotten about it until now.

"why do plants never get cancer?. all humans and most other animals are at risk of getting cancer during their lifetime.but why plants have the privilege of not getting this disease?

&#x200b;

i'm really impressed by most of your responses,but their is a question in my mind that is still bugging me.

when a person gets really old,cancer cells would form in a certain part of his body since his dna becomes ""weaker""as he got older ,but let's say just in this case that the cancer cells can not move to other parts of his body(metastasis )to make the situation similar to plants where cancer cells are locked in this position since they have cell walls that surround the cells. cancer cells would still originate from different parts of his body as he gets older until tumor covers all of  him and he dies.

this case is theoretically possible for a human,but some trees live for thousands of years and it doesn't seem that tumors are covering all of their parts...why?",9

i can't tell anyone because my family is anti-diet and thinks a child making healthy choices will automatically kill them. tried to drink water once. accused of ""tryna get that anorexia, your genetics can't be changed you're just overweight deal with it"" okay, juice it is, better than soda.

it sucked when i didnt want to eat something that serves 20 people by myself and i immediately get accused of  ""tryna get that anorexia"", then seconds later would get called out for being overweight and accused of sneaking cookies or whatever.

anyway, through good decisions i managed to obtain a healthy lifestyle and go from bmi 127 to 121. overweight to normal weight. all since new years (cliche i know).

i have a little ways to go before i'm at my medical ideal weight and i'm real proud tbh. lost inches off the waist and my old clothes fit me. but it feels like everyone still sees me as overweight. i get treated like it. no comments on me looking thinner.

it's for the best no one notices, because i'd so be seriously accused of having an eating disorder. but it still kinda invalidates my progress. whatever. it's not about what people think, it's about not getting diabetes and having to be lifted out of bed with a bulldozer scoop. healthy gang rise up.",11

the only reason i got hired was because i speak french. we get a lot of french-speakers in our store for some reason, and i'm the only one able to assist them.

i have curly hair so i normally do a half up, half down. but usually just leave it out because all my other coworkers don't tie their hair back either. i did slick it down into a bun during my interview and training. the slick down bun put strain on my edges and started to cause breakage.

my manager sat me down for a serious talk. she basically told me i had to wear my hair straight or *at least* slick down into a bun. that they have an image to sell and standard to uphold, they can't do that if i'm 'running around the store looking like a teenager.'

i told her that i can't straighten my hair because it will seriously damage it and gelling it down everyday will make it break off.  she told me that i have to abide by the appearance guidelines or i'll get written up.

i wish i did point out the double standards and hypocrisy. but in that moment i felt very small and didn't have the courage. when explaining what happened to a sibling and parent, they said i was being discriminated against and it's unacceptable. i don't know about hr or if we even have an hr in our store.

"for telling my girlfriend her dream of moving to another country will never happen?. my (25m) girlfriend (23f) has always talked about how it's her dream to move to x country. she brought it up on our first date (we've been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

at the beginning, i went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if i would go with her, how crappy our current country is (i'm an expat and she's a local), etc etc 

recently, however, every few times she mentions it, i'll bring up her spending habits. in the time we've been together, she's spent around 8,000usd+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

the last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she'd need to save to get started. 

after we had the number, i started calculating something else. balenciaga shoes + lv bag + gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it's never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

she's called me ta, that i'm trying to control her money, i'm trying to humiliate her, make her feel ""small"" and it's none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing

"by reading my brother's journal. this did actually happen today, as the clock had just barely struck midnight and christmas was upon us. also, this is my throwaway because dammit, i'll not have this following me to my actual account.

i was in the laundry room which doubles as the storage room, where belongings go to die. i saw a book that did not immediately appear to be a journal on one of the shelves, so i grabbed it and flipped it open to the middle. i recognized my younger brother's handwriting and knew i had wandered onto private property, but my eyes lingered a little too long on the page. 

my brother has been out of the house for several years. he deployed to afghanistan and got married when he returned to the states. he's always been a little weird but we (mostly) accept his quirks as just social anxiety and move on. but there i was, in the asscrack of christmas morning holding a journal that he obviously had written during his teenage years. it was one of those journals that ask you questions and you fill in the answers, and of course the question i opened to was ""what's something you hope no one ever finds out about you?""

there, staring at me from the page was the following sentence: ""that i had sex with one of the cows.""

yes, we grew up on a farm. i don't believe he was speaking merely of a corpulent maiden. 

i consider myself open minded, and have prepared myself for various scenarios with my siblings. what if they come out as gay or trans, what if they become addicts, what if they end up in prison, what if they were to join the circus. i have never entertained the possibility of ""what if they romanced the livestock."" life just doesn't prepare you for random bestiality.

wednesday, i'm back at work.  five o'clock rolls around, i go to my car, and i drive home. i walk in, and ooohh my god. the sexy surprise. my girlfriend in a maid lingerie costume (you know the type) waiting for me in our bedroom. fantastic. we start going at it, maid costume comes off, she's on top, and i go to kind of pin her arms against her back, and bend her over top of me. well, i was a bit aggressive about it. 

i proceed to body slam her onto myself, with her shoulder coming down into my mouth with a force at least equitable to the new naval rail gun. she asks if i'm alright, it's then i realize, no, no, i'm not alright. i taste iron in my mouth, and realize that, sure enough, she's dislodged one of my teeth. it's literally lying parallel in my mouth.  not to be outdone, i tell her sure, i'm fine, rip the tooth back into place (or as close as possible), and try to keep going. she doesn't say anything at first, then she informs me that apparently i've got blood all over my mouth. she was not really into that, apparently. 

i don't have dental insurance, so i go to the er, and regale the staff there with my sexual misadventure. missed work the next day, while arguing with insurance and going to the dentist. it's been quite the surprise.

tl/dr: girlfriend's sexual surprise ends with me losing a tooth and completely blue balled. 

edit: showed this to my girlfriend, she wanted me to update to include that she took care of the blue ball situation when i got back from the hospital. 10/10. 

edit 2: thanks for the gold! ",4
"i used to glue my friend's butt cheeks everytime he was drunk. light
every time me and my friend would go to a party he would get wasted and i since i can't drink i would stick to smoking. back to our dorms we would be pretty out of it but since he always passed out first i was left with stupid ideas. the first time i did it i swore he was going to find out but he didn't, he believed that he was the one doing it. so i just kept doing it. he stopped drinking after his girlfriend saw him trying to pry his butt cheeks apart.

"by trying to gay up my new apartment and triggering a swat response.. my partner and i pulled my car into the parking lot of the library. it was a hot summer day and we were there to use the wifi and checkout a couple books and return a couple that were overdue. i'd been inside about ten minutes when some commotion started in the parking lot. my partner noticed and decided to go gawk at it while i finished up. 


another five minutes go by and my partner hadn't returned. i'd seen a few police cars go by. i decided to go see what all the fuss was about. heading to the door i notice they're all clustered near my car. ""well this isn't good."" on closer examination i notice my partner approaching the group of officers. they'd just arrested some guy. exiting i overheard the second half of the conversation. 


""... and then you entered that vehicle, the blue one?""


""yes officer.""


""and took these items?""


""yes officer."" 


""and you entered these vehicles?"" the officer motioned to the row of cars, including mine. 


""yes.""


there wasn't much of value in my car. a few days prior we had picked up a few items at a garage sale for the new apartment for cheap. i wasn't too concerned -- none of the windows in any of the cars appeared smashed or anything. behind the officers a swarm of vehicles had boxed in another, a boring sedan. the door was ajar and inside i could see another officer setting items on the hood. it was a modest collection. none of my possessions appeared to be in the rather sizeable pile on the vehicle's hood.


he added nervously, ""except that one."" he motioned to my beat up saturn. and i say beat up, but really it looked like something out of mad max. the hood and quarter panel were painted flat black, while the rest of the car was purple. it was coated in a veneer of rust all over the underside, looking like it had been ridden hard and put up wet. 


my partner raised her voice, ""hey! why not my car?!"" well, i approached to correct her. i would regret this decision shortly. the officer gave a quizzical look at the would-be thief. 


""yes, why not *that* car?"", the officer says, turning back to the thief. 


at this point, i'd reached the small crowd and announced myself. ""excuse me, it's actually my car."" i got a polite nod, and the officers continued. i gave a questioning and slightly annoyed towards my partner. the thief, now appearing quite anxious, retorted ""because of the dead body!"" 


there was a moment of silence as all the officers jerked up and all looked at him, then my car. then me and my partner, all in rapid succession. they all reflexively put their hands on their sidearm and one of them looked at the two of us and said rather sharply ""don't move."" great. so now we've gone from petty theft to body stashing. an officer keyed up his radio to call for backup, ""suspicion of murder, suspects at gunpoint."" visions of officers opening the trunk to find some gruesome scene flashed through my head. my stomach braced. my partner and i exchanged nervous looks.


two other officers approached the car and peered into the back seat. at the same time then the guns came out of the holster and the two of them turned their attention to us, yelling, ""get on the ground!"" well this day is off to a great start. we've gone from overdue library books to murder. me and my partner both complied, while other officers opened up my car. i heard some excited noises from them followed by silence, ""uh chief, you better come see this."" both of them were grinning and looking back at the thief, who looked pale as a ghost. the plot sickens.


a third, rather larger man sauntered over and then burst out laughing, ""let them up,"" gesturing towards the officer with his knee in my back. ""okay, what the actual fuck is going on,"" i wondered to myself. the chief is practically out of breath from choking down laughter and tells his subordinate with the thief to go ahead and put him in the back of a squad car. we both approach nervously and peer into the car.


it was only then i realized what had happened. the thief had been going through the cars and skipped ours because, in the back seat, was a pile of mannequin parts. we'd found them in an alleyway a couple days prior in the esteemed loring park area, perhaps the gayest part of the twin cities. i'd entirely forgotten about them. we had intended to use them to decorate our new, and rather empty, apartment, and nothing says queer quite like a fashion mannequin holding coats by the door. he must have spotted them and decided they were the chopped up remains of someone. 


now, we both knew they looked realistic enough because we'd managed to scare the shit out of a former roommate who liked to rummage through our stuff by leaving an arm and some pillows under a blanket to make her think one of us was sleeping there and discourage snooping. but of course, she'd gotten too curious and gotten a dose of karma for her trouble. and now all the officers were taking turns, looking back at us, and grinning ear to ear at us and the idiot thief. in the end, we were left with many apologies and another tale for friends of my fabled car of the damned. a few minutes later a swat truck, driven by some bored officers, pulled up and took their turn looking and laughing.


tl;dr - was nearly given the chair for murdering a mannequin and overdue library books. 


edit: obviously officers don't talk like this. it happened a decade ago. forgive my attempt at recreating long forgotten conversation. also, yes, it really was swat. no, i can't explain it either. ",4
"rent increase continues to outgrow wage increase.. i am a super noob with finances. i've been out of college and in the work force for just under 3 years. each year, the rent increase on my apartment has outgrown the increase in wage salary. 

this year, the rent will increase by %17 while my salary is bumped by %1.

my napkin math tells me that this wage increase will only account for 1/3 of the rent increase.

am i looking at this incorrectly, or is my anxiety justified? i'm reading that rent should be 25-35% of income, and luckily the new rent doesn't move me out of that range, but i will need to change something, i'm thinking either cut back on savings, or move to even cheaper apartments (i'm already living in one of the cheapest places in the area), roommates, etc. 

thanks in advance",10

ive gotten a jillion messages from people offering everything from adoption to food to asking for updates so i thought i would tell you guys what ended up happening.the messages are still coming even now lol. i asked the people i am with if it was ok and they said yes but they made me let them read it first. it was kinda embarrassing but its ok. i kind of owe you all haha... 

my mother was charged with several things and is in jail but i dont think they actually put her in for the crimes yet. like she's waiting on the police to get evidence i think. as many of you guys thought the only people in my family allowed school was my brother and me. my second brother was 2 so i dont know if she would have let them put him in school. my sisters had to stay home. this wasnt weird to me because it was an all boys school. 

they said i will never go back to my mom again and my siblings won't either. they also said what we were in was a cult. we were all in one big apartment building kind of thing. they said they weren't sure the cult itself was illegal. just that some of the other stuff happening was. drugs and that some of the stuff was probably sexual assault but i can't talk about it very much. multiple people are in jail for it. lots of people left and i think theyre looking closely at the pastor.

so its ok. thank you all. i dont know if all 8 of us will stay together but we are safe now. its weird but in a good way. i dont think i'll have any more updated for a long time but i'll try if anything happens that seems like a good idea. i've been on reddit more but on a different account so thats why i haven't posted much. thank you all again.",2

"when buying something, why not think of it in terms of how long it'll take for you at work to pay it off?. a few weeks ago, i was having a discussion with my sister on the merits of buying a new car for $17000 vs a 2 year old car for $14000.

her argument was ""it's only $3000 more for a new car.""

my argument was that $3000 was **200 hours** of work (equivalent to **five weeks**) for her at $15/hour. 

personally i just feel like it helps me a lot whenever i'm making a purchase of anything... in my mind i'm always thinking ""well, i have to work 1.5 hours to pay for that"" and it typically makes me less likely to purchase it. seems like it's a pretty efficient way to save money and increase savings. thoughts?",10
"by finding out my dad is dating a milf i took home from a bar over a year ago and slept with multiple times.. hey reddit,

throwaway because i really don't want this on my main and it getting linked back to me. tl:dr at the bottom.

obligatory the technically happened over a year ago but it hit me today at lunch.

okay so i'll start off by saying my mother and father divorced 5 and a half years ago, my mom has remarried but my dad has been very hit and miss with his luck dating. when he first started dating women i'd always get introduced to them early and then they would disappear off the face of the earth so i asked my dad to not introduce me to anyone until they are serious and have been together for at least 3 or 4 months. 

a bit of back story so y'all can see where this is going. last july to be exact me and some buddies were out at a bar and being young competitive men saw some older ladies out at the bar (mid 40's) and had a bit of a joke around that none of us would be able to take any of them home. well about 10 drinks and a few hours later our little laugh turned into a serious competition. we went over introduced ourselves, had small talk about what they are doing out, were a bit flirty etc and hit them up for a bit of a dance. i got talking to an absolutely fit, stunning dark haired lady who i'll call susan. we were flirting, having a dance and a good time, i got her some drinks and could tell she was having a great time. anyway as the night progressed i thought i'd shoot my shot and see if i could take a milf home, i found out that she had 2 kinds, one who was only a year younger than me. here i am, fulfilling one of my biggest fantasies. so i get a uber for us and she comes back to my apartment. we had really good sex and i got her number the next day after i drove her back to her car. we hooked up 2 more times before i met my current girlfriend.

well a couple of weeks ago my dad calls me and tells me he wants me to meet this woman he has been dating for 5 months. he'd told me a bit about her, including that her name was susan but we live in a pretty big city and i never thought anything of it. somehow of everything he told me nothing registered in my brain. he had said she had 2 kids a similar age to me, and most importantly that they had really hit things off and he really enjoyed her company and wasn't feeling lonely for the first time in years. anyway he asked me to come for lunch today to meet her and was really excited. 

i got to lunch around 15 minutes early and was waiting for my dad and the new lady he's dating to show up, and low and behold i see my dad pull up out the front of the cafe we are having lunch at and see him and the new lady get out of the car. at this point i did the biggest double take of my life, surely it couldn't be...

but it was, my dad, for 4-5 months has been dating the milf i took home from a bar over a year ago. i nearly had a panic attack. as soon as they walked in my dad pointed at the table that i was sitting at and i saw susan's face screw up. she was walking behind my dad and just pulled a face that said ""don't you dare say anything right now"". 

so i sat through the most awkward 45 minute lunch of my life, sweating profusely with my dad asking me if i was alright because i looked sick. i can't even remember what we talked about at lunch because the whole time i realised that me and my dad are tunnel buddies now and i honestly am at a loss for what will even happen next. i want to talk my dad but i can't even imagine the conversation at this stage. i'm hoping susan breaks things off and it doesn't go any further. how the fuck does this even happen, it's like the plot to a bad porn movie!!!

tl:dr - my dad is dating a lady who i have slept with before, she is mid 40's and my dad is early 50's and i can tell he is head over heels for her. just so y'all know i'm 24.

update - so this has blown up and i decided to tell a couple of my buddies to ask what to do. i'll be catching up with dad with some beers to tell him because if the situation was reversed i'd want to know. will update after i've told him.",4
"by encouraging female ejaculation nsfw. so i've been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we've cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit. this wasn't a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there's no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting.

that being said, a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive pornography-grade squirting. she goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how, and we proceed to make plans to explore this further. next thing i know she's cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to extinguish a burning chemical factory while i'm right there dumping fuel on the flames.

now, before i get carried away here, i'll just say, i'm a m nurse by trade, and i have no delusions about what's really going on. i can tell exactly where her 'juices' are coming from, and i've made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while i go down on her, no big deal.

so finally, to the point. she's been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and i've gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes. the most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss didn't taste at all like i'd thought it would. ranging from unflavored gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants (that you dump sugar packets into). i thought it was a fluke at first, but after repeatedly testing this observation, i'm quite certain that her piss tastes sweet, sometimes blatantly so.

the perverted side of me thought all this was kinky as hell, so i really didn't think on it too much until this morning. i just woke up and had a weird nurse's epiphany about it. sweet urine. glucose urine. glycosuria. jesus christ. i'm a fucking dumbass. i race over to my bag where i keep my backup glucometer for work, wake her bleary-eyed ass up, and pricked her finger to check her blood sugar. 441. **fuck!** recheck. 453. **shit!!** asymptomatic, but hyperglycemic as fuck. she's got the beetus. diabetes. i broke the news as gently as i could, which was something to the tune of ""holy shit fuck! that's some serious fucking diabetes! call your doctor!"" hysterics ensued. so now she's out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment, and i'm sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how i knew..

tldr; by breaking some bad news to a girl after she ""squirted"" in my face and i diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet.

---------------------------------

update: insert the obligatory ""omg this went supernova!!1"" .. on a serious note though, thanks for the reddit gold~~en shower~~. this has been a long day and i haven't felt this cool on the internet since that time i used a voice modulator in an mmorpg to convince my guild i was a black guy.

to bring things current, the girl is doing fine now, they've ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she's a type 1 diabetic, but it'll take a few days and tests to confirm the preliminary results. she's got a lot on her mind, all i can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to irreversibly connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth.

still, the response has been hilariously fantastic. while there's a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up, i'll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that, such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together, my majorly panicked reaction to it, and the resulting state of hysteria i had caused after scaring the girl half to death. that all kind of overshadowed the lucky guess i made, in my mind anyway. no longer though! right now i feel like the fucking **man**, thanks for helping me see the cloud's golden lining!",4
"my parents are cock-blocking me. bit of a backstory: my so and i have been together 11 years, married for 1.5 years. we've had a normal sex life with ups and downs, are always open communication wise about sex and our wants/needs. it's always been a healthy relationship that we consciously work on. 

3 months ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and asked us to move back home to help out with the day to day and have also been helping financially. we both have low earning professions, and have been doing our best to be helpful. most days, we are pretty tired by the end of the night, once everything is done and my parents are asleep. my mom has also made a comment about how she expects us to find another place to have sex. she has suggested getting hotel rooms or having sex in my car. we don't make enough to pay for hotel stays, and it's illegal to do it in a car where i'm from. to top it off my husband has said he doesn't feel comfortable in my parents home.  we've had sex once since moving in a month and a half ago. and it wasn't good sex. it was awkward. 
i know that sex isn't everything in a relationship, but as i've said to my husband, i feel like i have become more of a best friend than a wife. i'm not really sure what to do to make my husband feel more comfortable, or where to have sex without running the risk of getting arrested.


edit: thanks for the feedback, i was asked about my cultural background, i'm from a middle eastern family, where respecting your parents is kinda huge. 
also we weren't 10 when we met, i'm 32 now. 
does anyone have any tips on shower sex? even though my bod is wet, there's no lubrication down there so it never works out. i also have the squeakiest bed which accounted for a lot of the awkwardness. and pumping music and tv will wake my father up(remember he has cancer and needs to rest)
moving out is a great idea but rent in our city is ridiculous and would take months to save for since i'm giving my parents a lot of our income. i'm also trying to save for school so i can have a better lot in life. after all that i'm basically broke, so even air b&b is difficult.",7

"i left my ex-husband because he tried to pimp me out. i never told this to my friends or my family, which is why all of them still give me a hard time for leaving the relationship.

i met my now ex-husband when we were teenagers and after we both graduated from college we got married. we were doing alright for the first year but halfway through the second things went downhill. my ex-husband had a plan to start his own business and spent a lot of time saving up money. a friend of his was also in the plan and he was supposed to be the co-owner. 

halfway through the process, my husband quit his job to dedicate himself to the project full time while his friend kept his job and would do most of the work from his home. the first month wasn't bad but on the second month the business was pretty much dead. since my ex was so focused on his business i was left to care for the bills and very soon i noticed that we would need to move.

i talked to my ex that the money was short and even showed him some other places that we could rent. he told me he wasn't going to because we were much closer to the business location. which was true but also was much more expensive since it was a high traffic area. i was working full time and there wasn't much i could do besides sell some stuff to pay that month's rent. 

i managed to hold on to the place for two months but there wasn't anything left that i could sell and the business had drained my ex's saving. i tried talking him out of it multiple times but he wasn't having any of it. he then started to ask me for money which spiralled into a fight where he said he would take care of the bills himself because apparently i was spending money with bullshit. 

three months later, after my ex's sold pretty much all the furniture in the apartment, i received a letter from the landlord saying that we would be out of the place because the rent was late. i showed it to my ex because i really believed he was looking for a job (which he had promised) and that all the furniture went for the rent, only to find out he was spending all the money to salvage the now dead business. 

he apologized and burst into tears. i told him to contact his family because i would call mine, just until we could find somewhere cheaper and build ourselves back up. he immediately started screaming that he was the leader and he already had a plan. he told me to go take a shower and put on my best lingerie because he was going to call the landlord. apparently, the landlord had already said that he would give us more time if i had sex with him a few times and my ex agreed to it.

i left that same night and went to a friend's house. to everyone who asked i would say that i left him because i didn't love him anymore (which is partially true). i sent the divorce papers two weeks later and he signed the same day he received. last i heard of him he was living with another friend of his. the friend who was his co-owner jumped out of the boat 3 weeks after because he got a promotion.

i live now by myself and due to me working my ass off to get the money while i was married, i got a promotion as well.

"nsfw i have a daughter. when i was fifteen i had a friend that i was kinda close to and i had a crush on her for so long. she was a lesbian though so that was out of the question. one day she started talking about how much she wanted a kid (she was 19 at the time) and of course being close to her she talked to me about it a lot.  

now i was still a virgin and very much attracted to her so i start hinting that i could impregnate her. we very slowly came about this conclusion together and agreed it would be a good way to go about it. she wanted someone she trusted to do it and i was almost like a brother to her.  

my best friend at the time let us use his house to do the deed and it was really awkward. she played music on her phone so any noises we made wouldn't be heard. at first we tried standing up with me behind her but she was too short so we wound up with missionary. she was just as awkward and nervous as i was so she didn't want to take her pants off all the way but i quickly realized this would be impossible in this position so i quickly took them off of her and went at it. it got really heated and it seemed like she was into it which really surprised me and turned me on more which fixed the nervousness and i finished after a few minutes. after that point it was somehow much less awkward and we left, chatting a bit throughout the day.  

a few days went by and she told me she wanted to do it a few more times to be sure it worked. she didn't exactly have to twist my arm to agree but my friend's parents were home at weird hours that week and we couldn't use his house again. there were some pretty expansive woods near our high school that we would skip class in all the time so we found a secluded spot in there. the next few times we wound up having sex were blissful.  

after a while she found out she was pregnant. she had told me beforehand that she didn't want me to be an actual father figure for the child and her family was gonna take care of everything for her. it's been six years and that still holds true, she doesn't want me to be in her life (not in a malicious way) and is taking care of the child herself. she wound up blocking me on social media because my friend wound up telling people about it and she thought it was me but we cleared that up and there's nothing negative between us. although i think i wound up blocking her at one point after because i got a facebook message request years ago from a different profile saying it was her and she just wanted to talk about the situation. i haven't talked to her for about five years now.  

you'd think this would be a great situation, right? i got to have sex with a girl i was crushing hard on and even though it resulted in her having a kid, i don't have to put any time or finances into it. most guys would kill for the opportunity i'd imagine. but i have a lot of problems that i want to discuss a little bit. first of all, there's this strange, deep twinge in me that jerks when i think about the fact that *i have a daughter* and *i'm a father*. i've procreated and technically fulfilled my biological purpose in life. i don't necessarily want to be in her life or want to meet her, but it's weird thinking about all that and it fucks with my head sometimes.  

my current so is an absolutely amazing woman that i love dearly and i know i'm going to marry. she's my best friend and my soulmate. we've both vehemently agreed that we aren't having kids; we aren't financially stable and even if we get to that point, neither of us could deal with that kind of stress. she doesn't know. i haven't told her and i don't know if i ever will. i feel like despite our deep connection and love and understanding for each other, she would look at me in a way that would make me feel as if i'm some sort of monster. i don't want to disappoint her like that. i just can't. i don't want to let this past decision affect something so pure and wonderful in my life. it's like i'm dealing with a heavy guilt that's never going to go away.",12
"by using my roommate's ""toy"" nsfw. my roommate and i are pretty close and have an open policy about going into each others' ""bedside drawers"" (need condoms, lube, etc.) as far as i know, neither of us has used this liberty until now. my roommate is out of town for a few weeks for a marathon and vacation and i am kind of lazy when it comes to certain things. 

due to improper planning, i ran out of personal lubricant so i took a visit to my roommate's drawer to see if he had some. he did, as well as some other things. one of those things was what i can only describe as a triple cock-ring (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/3178jrk6a1l._sy355_.jpg) contraption.
for context, my roommate is a 6'2 black guy and i'm a 5'10 ginger. naturally, i assumed that, if anything, this device would be too big for me. i was woefully wrong.

i was in the mood so i didn't think through the possible consequences of placing my most precious parts in this stainless steel death trap. almost immediately after wriggling my naughty bits into this thing, i realized my horrible mistake. 

within 30 seconds, my twig and berries transformed into a grotesque set of eggplant and plums. as with any bad situation, i figured my best way out was to power through. i took the aforementioned lube and went to town.

after what felt like a lifetime, i began to approach climax. for my trouble, i was hoping for an intensely pleasurable orgasm. again, i was wrong. 

instead of a powerful release, i was met with an intense pain in my perineum and nothing came out. this thing was so tight that there was no ejaculate. i freaked out.

i figured once i got this nonsense torture device off my situation, things would resolve themselves but again, i was wrong.

the caricature emoji that was my junk, remained fully engorged.
i continued to freak out. i didn't want to go to the er and have some firefighter saw this horrifying mistake off my adult parts, so i did the next logical thing. 

i filled a bowl with ice and water, dunked my bits and hoped for salvation. after 15 minutes, the swelling subsided to the point that i could manipulate the affected area out of the contraption.
after another 20 minutes of icing my genitals, i went to relieve myself and proceeded to pass, what i assumed to be, a frothy mixture of man milk and urine.

2/10 do not try.

tl;dr: use a flexible cock ring, and don't be racist",4

"in schools, athletics are put on a way too high of a priority. i'm not really talking about high schools, middle schools, etc. i'm talking about university. colleges in general are *way* too willing to blow thousands on a *game.*

now i get it, there's a slim possibility that someone is going to the pros. however, first of all, sports contribute little to nothing to society, other then entertainment. second of all, someone studying science for example is *way* more likely to enter a realistic, high paying, and beneficial job after graduation. 

where's the proof? check out this link. 
https://hepinc.com/newsroom/state-universities-spending-over-100000-per-athlete-8-to-12-times-more-than-academics/

some universities are spending *12 times* the amount of money on a athletic student in contrast to a academic one. are you serious? i get it, ok? sports are fun, and there is a chance that one of your players will get to the pros. however, academics are *important.* that's the difference. you really don't mean to tell me that universities are willing to blow *12x* the amount of money on entertainment rather then the actual main focus of their college. 

by the way, you may be thinking that this is all worth it due to revenue from games, right? check out this statistic.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-01-06/college-football-teams-are-risky-and-expensive-and-schools-keep-adding-them

an average of a million in revenue. that's a lot. except that it's simply not enough for the cost. a typical fcs school football team costs 3.5 *million* to maintain. and that's not even accounting for stadium costs, maintenance, coaches and staff (not sure about this one, article didn't specify if they're actually covered), etc. 

let's say a school did actually manage to make up for that. is it really worth it? is a student who's could make the greatest touchdown really worth more then a student who could possibly cure cancer? it's just all so pointless to me. i get it, you need to have some fun, but it shouldn't be getting in the way of students who want to get success through academic means rather then athletic means.",6
"my mother just died. i am 24 years old. i don't know how to handle anything.. edit; thank you for every single one of you, omg. i can't believe how much advice i am getting. it's so overwhelming. i am reading every single one of your posts and i can't respond to you all, but thank you thank you thank you.

i requested a autopsy because: 

yes, she had pancreatic cancer but it was early stages. she had surgery to get a tumor removed, and was doing chemotherapy because she had 2 lymph nodes that were infected. she was doing really well, generally tired, but not very many side affects from the chemo. on monday, she went back to work, and she felt really good. tuesday, wednesday, both good. thursday she took off work because that is when she had chemo and she wanted to rest. thursday she was talking to a family friend saying she was just tired and didnt feel very good. thursday she probably should have went to the hospital but didnt. 

3 am: my mother called 911 and told them she couldnt breathe. my grandma heard her and called out to her and she responded to her, and she was laying on the bathroom floor. once the ambulance got there she was unresponsive and they took her to the er and gave her medicine that would help her heart and then they would do cpr. once the medicine wore off, her pulse would stop, they'd give her more meds, and it would last for about 2 minutes. her heart wouldnt beat on its own. they did this cycle about 12 times. they tried 1 last thing, gave her some medicine that is supposed to clear a blood clot, and see if that would help, but it did not. i had to make the decision (as her poa) to stop the machines and let her go. (i was watching them as they did this... and nothing seemed to help)

as the family we decided to do an autopsy because we don't know exactly what caused her death. yes she had cancer, but she said she couldnt breathe. a heart attack? a blood clot? we dont know, and the er doctor did not know. my mother was my best friend, and i really took care of her these last few months, it's hard to see her go the way she did.


hi all, please bare with me. i am all over the place and i would like some guidance on what to do in this type of situation. 
my mother just died unexpectedly yesterday. i have some guidance from family on what to do but i want to see what other people think so i am coming to you. 

my mother owned her house, only 10k left to pay on it. 
she lost her job about 4 years ago or so, used all of her savings account and 401k to live off of. she finally got a job last year making half of what she used to make, but still able to pay her bills. she fell sick this year (stage 1-2 pancreatic cancer, found early, had surgery) so she was off of work since april. they were giving her half of her paycheck, and then whatever fell short i gave her money. i've paid her mortgage twice, i pay her comcast bill on the regular. my grandmother lives with her and she pays our phone bill. so all my mom really pays is the utilities of the house, and our car insurance. (me, her, and my brother). 

she has built up some credit card debt, which from what i can see on her bank account is $13k. she has some other bills that aren't paid, just because she couldnt afford it. 

my brother doesn't help her much, maybe a few hundred here and there, but it's never enough. i've used my savings account just to pay for her mortgage, when i live with my boyfriend and give him half for our mortgage too. needless to say, my account is going down. i get $1,300 every two weeks for my paycheck. depends on how much i work.

anyways, i called her life insurance agent and he was going to put in a claim, although we have to wait for her death certificate and her autopsy report. which having an autopsy done is costly and delays services. i just don't know what i am supposed to do with all of her bills, the car insurance, the phone bill, the house.. i don't know what to do with it all, and it may seem early to be thinking of this, but i want to be ready to know what to do. 

my grandma lives with her. i don't know what to do with my grandma. i think she plans on staying in the house but that's a lot of money to keep paying off when i don't live there. 

also, i know she has a will. how do i find out about that? do i need to get a laywer?

please anyone.. help me



edit: we live in illinois.
edit again: i forgot she has social security income from when my father died for me, and apparently they paid her ""too much"" so she was supposed to/have been paying that back too. i don't know if she has been.
i believe she owes the irs money too.

"for locking a kid in the bathroom?. i(26f) am single and currently living in an apartment with my cat. next door lives what looks like a single mother(40+-) and her son(8). i work early shifts, so i am usually home in the afternoons and would spend the rest of the day playing video games or painting.

the mother next door sometimes would drop her son by my door and ask me to look after him as she goes out, she would usually pick him up a few hours later. i am actually quite reluctant to help but consider that they may be in difficult situations i just suck it up. it's not like i have to babysit or entertain him, just letting him play my video games for a few hours and that's all. the son sometimes makes a mess by rummaging through my things but i could handle that by telling him off and tidy them up later. 

it was another one of the days when i let the son in and left him be. for a while everything seemed to be fine, until i realized that my cat was missing. i looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be seen. i then turned to the kid and asked if he had anything to do with it, but he was busy with his game and brushed me off impatiently. some time later, i found my terrified cat in the freezer.

i confronted the kid and demanded to know why he did that? he swore to god that he had nothing to do with it at first, then changed his words and said that the cat jumped in when he took some ice for his drinks. i then ignored his protests and locked him in the bathroom for the rest of his stay till his mother came to pick him up.

not surprisingly the mother was furious about how i treated her son. i told her that i did it for the safety of my cat because i found her precious kid trying to kill her. she argued that i could have locked up my cat instead, in which i replied that i had no obligation looking after her son in the first place. she threatened to press charges against me before storming away with her son. 

i shared this with my friends and while some said i should have rejected them a long time ago, others said i went too far. what do you think?


edit: i need to point out that the agreement to ""look after"" the kid was that i only needed to allow him inside and play video games and he stays till his mother returns. i am no ""babysitter"" and i made it clear to the mother, in which she agreed to it and still asked for my help.


for those who wondered, kid wasn't locked up for ""hours"", maybe 30min~ or so, i don't really remember, was busy checking on my petrified cat. the cat is fine too.",3

"by trying to shake obama's hand and almost getting taken out by secret service and ruining thousands of peoples day.. as with most tifu, this did not happen today but the memory was spurred by a post i saw on the front page. during the 2008 election, obama came to my university to give a speech. i went through all the usual security screenings and made my way to my seat. i was about 3 rows from the front but on the outside seat of a row right against the entry and exit way for the future president. 

when obama came out, he went straight to the podium to give his speech and do a qanda session. when he finished he made his way down the steps where the crowd rushed to shake his hand. i was probably 4^th or 5^th down the walkway to shake his hand. everybody in front of me was not only shaking his hand but handing him copies of his book to sign. he had a pen in his hand and was signing away. i thought to myself ""damn, i don't have anything for him to sign. hmmm oh wait! yes i do. my ticket i used to get into the event."" there was only 1 issue with the ticket, it was in my jacket pocket...**my inside jacket pocket**. so as the future president is 4 people away, i hastily reach my hand into my jacket pocket to grab my ticket but my hand kinda fumbled around a little before latching onto the ticket. just long enough for the 2 secret service agents standing right in from of me to notice...

they immediately grabbed both my arms, while the one who grabbed my arm that was in the jacket twisted it to pull my hand out of the pocket while preparing to break my arm off if it was any kind of dangerous object. it all happened so fast i couldn't even utter a word, but when they saw all i had was a piece of paper for obama to sign, he let go of my arm, patted me on the shoulder, and mumbled something into his headset. i was just able to get my bearings about me and i was the last person to shake obama's hand at that event.  about that time the security all turned to obama and shuffled him through an open door to the hallway to exit. as obama was being ushered out he said ""sorry guys, they said i have to leave now."" as he was pointing at the secret service around him. so not only did i almost get taken out by secret service, i ruined anybodies day that wanted a chance to meet the man.




tl;dr: tried to shake obama's hand and get an autograph, reached in my jacket and got assaulted by secret service and made obama have to leave which ruined a bunch of peoples day.

"please stop suggesting mechanical turk to people in financial need. its a horrible waste of time.. almost every time i see a post for someone requesting a way to earn some extra money to cover some bills there are a half dozen people suggesting that they sign up for amazon mechanical turk and they can earn a couple hundred a month.

this is completely untrue and people that never tried this website need to stop suggesting it. it is an utter waste of someone's time. 

a few years ago i found myself at home unable to find work and unable to get out and look for work in a brick and mortar setting. it was due to health problems with a family member and i was pretty desperate to earn some money.

i will tell you what things have gone back to this and right now i am going through the same thing and when i see people suggest mechanical turk i can only believe they never tried it.


first of all you have to understand that much of the work in the hits they give you is not really related to honest work. much of it is psychological profiling and testing and as you will see some of it is not even available to you because they are targeting very specific groups. more so you will find that the hits that are available often pay about 10 cents us or less and take you 15 minutes or so to perform. many are looking at someone's website to find mistakes, some are looking at images and sorting them and others are just so random you can't really understand why anyone wants this stuff done.. but heck if you can fork out $5 and have 500 of these things going does it matter?


so my experience is very poor with mturk

i do understand though that some people .. very very few people that to private work through mturk do get paid a bit more. you have to be pre-approved to do this work. its not open to everyone and the few hits of this type that i was approved for to do some writing were unjustifiably difficult to get paid for.


my earnings back a couple years

http://i.imgur.com/uehew9m.png


examples of hits you can earn.. look how little they pay 

3 cents for 20 minutes

1 cent for 5 minutes

http://i.imgur.com/aoeidon.png


highest paid hits are very unique .. and they are asking you to do stuff thats not quite on the up and up.. asking you to look for movies and use your internet account .. be on a specific cable provider.. then show them a screenshot of the movie.. wth

you just can not earn money on mechanical turk

how are you going to spend 10 minutes earning 3 cents? 

this is worse than what they pay people in india.. these hits are probably indian companies hiring american workers that they put out of work to do their jobs for pennies...

i mean really .. more than happy to make money helping companies this way but its got to pay more than 10 cents an hour...

http://i.imgur.com/hgzz0u7.png

the highest paid hits are transcriptions of 2 hour movies.. wow thats a ton of work for $35

by the second page all of the hits that are sorted high to low are down in the sub $1 area and taking an hour or much longer... 

example one is.. post 10 videos of yourself.. we will pay you 75cents... ok but then you also have a high probability of having these hits rejected. or reused in ways you don't want to think about.. 

from my experience mechanical turk is not a honest place to earn any amount of extra cash.. sure you might make something and i did after months i made like $20 but it is such an utter waste of your time.. you would be better off just sleeping or cleaning your home or anything more productive than trying to earn money on this site.

facts:

he usually borrows my photography gear regularly and this is the first time he dissappeared completely. before he dissappeared he agreed to borrow my gear for a day only.

he has been deliberately avoiding me for about 10 days before i thought of asking help from his friends and families thru social media private message.

i have even filed a report to the local authorities on the 5th day, but this was taking too long and i need my gear for an event! so i decided to asked for help from his contacts.

this was effective as some of his families contacted him when they saw my message to them. the day after that he shows up and returned all of my gear. it turns out that some of them got damaged but he promised to pay for them.

he is now threatening to file a case against me for humiliating him to his contacts. but if i haven't done that, i don't think i can get my gear back!

this was my message to his contacts:

""hello, if you know mr xxxx please tell him to return my photography gear as i have been trying to reach him and he is deliberately evading me! he borrowed my gear 10 days ago and he has not returned it. i need the gear badly and this is costing me too much. appreciate your help if you can help me contact him."" -- then i attach a photo of his identification card with his photo

"by ruining my teachers life..  

so like every other post this didn't happen today and this story will be kept as vague as possible while still telling the story because i don't want people to find out who i am lol..

in order to understand why this all happened i have to explain that i was in high school and was dating a girl we will call samantha, well when i started dating samantha i was friends with her sister joselyn beforehand and it turns out that joselyn had a thing for me that i was oblivious to. anyways i thought she had gotten over it as me and samantha had been dating for over 2 years already and there never seemed to be any sort of bad blood between the three of us. this is where the fuck up happened.. one day in school my girlfriend and i decided to skip class and were walking in the halls when we saw that a teacher had left their room open (without going too much into detail this teacher had the biggest room due to the type of class they taught.) so we decided to go in there to skip class and being horny teenagers we started doing more than just talking and hanging out... after that samantha decides to tell joselyn what we did because it was super crazy and full of adrenaline... this is how i found out that joselyn was still holding resentment after all this time. she told her parents about what samantha and i did in that classroom and her parents called the school which lead to an investigation on the teacher to see if he was leaving his door unlocked on purpose to allow the students to go in there and do as they please, the whole investigation put a strain on an already weak marriage the teacher was in which lead to a divorce and the teacher was found ""at fault"" for not locking his door and condoning this behavior so he was forced to resign and basically the teacher wont be allowed to teach again in our district.. the teacher is now working at a local grocery store baking cookies and basically i will always remember this shit as i feel awful and dont know what to do or fix it.

""well', said little johnny, ""because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and probably wouldn't be an accident either.""",0
"my brother shot himself yesterday.. he's currently in the icu, on a breathing machine. he's unresponsive, and he's not going to make it. all i can think about is what a shitty sister i have been for the last few years. i should have been better. i should have been there for him when he needed me. he's only 15, his birthday is in january and he's going to miss it. 

on sunday the machine gets shut off and he will be gone forever. i will never see him again. 

jordon, i'm so sorry. i'm so fucking sorry.

edit: i didn't expect this to get so much attention. i've been at the hospital as much as i can. i know that it won't make up for lost time, but at least it's something. i'll be there tomorrow, too. thank you for all the support, it is greatly appreciated.

edit 2: please don't tell me to wait. it's not my decision, it's my mom's. he's not coming back from this, he's declining. i don't need to hear that letting him go is wrong.

final edit: he's gone. i stayed with him and held his hand until the end. i don't know what i'm going to do now, but i guess i'll figure it out. thank you again for all of your love and support and prayers. i hope that he is free of his pain and keeping my grandma good company.",11
"having a baby, super excited! but any place around here wants 2-300 weekly for childcare. where do people who have never budgeted for child care find an extra thousand/1200 dollars in their existing income stream?. honestly 200ish sounds fairly reasonable. i mean i get it, dont get me wrong. and we're not so bad off that diapers, clothes, ect is going to hurt us. but with health care bills piling up, the expected 2k delivery copay (assuming all goes well) and existing bills already, where does it come from?! 

we've been able to save about 400 a month, and with just eating out less (we go out out 40ish once a week and probably 3-4fast/cheap takeouts each week) well recoup some money to the tune of 100 bucks a week. we'd have more discretionary income if i stopped putting renovations in the house, but not a lot... a new spigot here, a paint job there... i redid the floors in hardwoods recently and still have moldings to buy and install. the new (5 month old) privacy fence needs stained. it's all ( relatively) little stuff and i save a small fortune by turning my own wrenches on the cars, fixing my own plumbing/electrical/interior stuff. 

 we've got a couple grand in savings which i know isn't enough; in fact that number represents slightly less than what my wife nets in a month at her hourly job. of course theres maternity to think about too- complete job security but its unpaid due to her lack of tenure.  

everyone says ""oh you did it in the right order; you moved out, went to college, got married, got good jobs, bought a house before you got pregnant"" but we've not been graduated long- 3 years for me, 2 for her- so the extra i used to throw in savings is gone to eliminating my college debt, the car i have, the downpayment on the house, the fence... 

...i'm realizing this is super long. where have yall found the money to be responsible for this whole other human  life? (mostly the childcare part)

edit: thank you guys all so much for the help. i'm talking to my wife about all this and we feel a lot better. there are some great people out there (and some not so great?..) and i thank you guys for crafting and maintaining this discussion. i'll check back tomorrow for more. ",10

"my dad died last week and it was perfect. my father died last week.  he was 54 years old and the healthiest he had been in decades.  to say this was unexpected is an understatement of insane proportions.  my parents were 3 to 5 years away from retirement and had been making plans to travel.  i had also been about to quit my job, sell my car and move to a different state in hopes of finding out what i want to do with my life.  now everything has just stopped.  all plans have been blown up.  everything is so uncertain and scary.  the only peace i have found, has oddly been in the way my father died.  
my parents were snorkeling on the last day of their two week hawaiian vacation.  snorkeling is my fathers favorite thing to do anywhere it is warm enough.  he will stay in he water for hours.  he loves to dive really deep, touch the bottom, come back up, and then dare us to do the same.  he is always so proud of everyone's accomplishments (his included) no matter how small they may seem.  on this particular day, my parents were snorkeling in a popular spot in oahu.  they had been in the water for over an hour and decided to head back to shore.  my dad began to feel tired, so they stopped to float on their backs while my dad caught his breath.   after a few minutes, he told my mom that he didn't think he would be able to make it back to shore.  he is a great swimmer, but a big guy, and my mom wouldn't be able to get him back to shore on her own so she asked nearby swimmers for their help in pulling him back to shore.  by the time they made it to the shore, he was already dead.
my father had a massive heart attack and died in minutes.  he had no pain.  my father passed away, floating on his back in the warm waters of hawaii, staring at the blue sky.  the last image he had in his head was beautiful, his last smell was the ocean, his last thoughts were peaceful and the last voice he heard was my mother.
is there a better way to go?

"jack, a renown atheist, dies.... ... and to his utter surprise ends up in hell where he's greeted by satan himself.

completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""welp, i've been wrong all my life and i guess i'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

satan laughs and replies: ""awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

he then proceeds to escort jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

as they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

every time they stop to a house satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

at sunset the devil sees that jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

as they walk to jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and jack asks: ""what's behind there?""

satan: ""oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

despite his curiosity jack thought better not to bother satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

that night however jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

after a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

on the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

the following morning satan showed up once again and told jack to come with him.

jack pleaded: ""please! please! don't take me to hell, i'll do anything just let me stay here, i don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

satan: ""what are you talking about??? i'm just gonna show you the recreational center like i told you yesterday""

jack: ""don't lie to me, i saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

satan: ""ooooh you saw that! don't worry  that's not for you, that's the christian hell""

jack: ""the christian hell? why would the christian hell be like that?""

satan: ""i don't know either man, they just want it that way""

"my (18f) parents are disowned me and kicked me out because i accidentally got pregnant. edit: sorry for that glaring typo in the title.

this entire situation blew up so fast in my face that i'm still reeling.

i should probably preface this by saying that my parents are extremely strict asian immigrant parents. it's always been education and academics before love and support. i grew up being physically beat for getting a single ""b"" grade on my report card and having to give my mother my passwords to all of my accounts. nevertheless, i obeyed their every command. i graduated just last week in the top 10% of my class and am going to brown university on an almost full-ride (more on that later in regards to the current situation) this fall. 

following my college acceptances, i probably breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life. my parents finally had nothing to complain about since i fulfilled their biggest dream for me: ""to get into an ivy league school."" all was good for about a month. my parents finally stopped reading my text messages, tracking my every move, etc. i was free to go out with friends, spend time with my *secret* boyfriend, and just enjoy being a high schooler. 

my boyfriend and i have been together since last summer, so almost a year now. my parents had their suspicions about us in the beginning but i brushed it off and faked my way into making them believe he was just a friend. but after i committed to brown and they seemed happy enough, i became more lax about hanging out with him and i think they figured it out. 

we started being sexually active in december but have always been incredibly careful about using protection. the only time where i'm not 100% sure we were careful was during spring break when we went to mexico with a couple of our friends and got drunk and had sex. it would make a lot of sense if that's when it happened. now, i fully understand that we were both stupid and should have exercised a lot more caution. it's our fault completely and i'm not saying otherwise.

fast-forward to about a week ago. i'm starting to get weird period-like symptoms, but no period. at that point, i honestly just knew. it was like this weird gut feeling and i freaked the fuck out. my boyfriend was incredibly supportive and drove me over to his house where he'd already gotten tests and had me take two of the pretty expensive ones. all positive. i broke down and cried for hours. 

when i got home, i was still visibly upset despite trying my best to hide it. but i wasn't acting carefully or thinking rationally because of everything that happened. i spoke to him explicitly about the situation over a messaging app that my mom has my password to. in retrospect, she definitely suspected that something happened between me and him (probably a break-up) so she logged on to read our messages. 

the very next day, i wake up to the sound of my mom lugging all of my stuff out of my room and throwing it onto our lawn. i get up and ask what the fuck she's doing and she's crying and calling me the nastiest stuff in chinese like, ""you're a whore, just kill yourself,"" or, ""i should have gave you up for adoption you useless piece of shit."" and other completely ridiculous things like, ""now you're a prostitute and no longer a virgin, no good boy will ever want to marry you now."" 

i was begging her to stop but the more i did the angrier she got. she was breaking the majority of my stuff, tearing up my work/papers, smashing my photographs, etc. all i could to was call my boyfriend and have him pick me up. 

it's been three days since that happened. i've picked up all of my stuff, at least the stuff that isn't irreparably damaged. my mother or father is not returning any of my calls but continuously sends me brutal text messages about how much of a failure and disappointment i am and how i turned into a prostitute. she also communicated that she will no longer be paying for my education at brown and that i will never be allowed to call her my mother and have any interaction with her. my yearly tuition not including personal expenses is around $15,000. i have about $10,000 in my own personal checking account from just working a few jobs throughout high school. however, that's not counting the birthday money i've received and the money that my grandfather left me when he passed. those are in a separate account being controlled by my mother. there's about $75,000 in there and i have no idea how i'm going to get it back.

i'm currently living with my boyfriend. his parents are at a complete loss as to why my parents are behaving this way and i am so ashamed. they've been nothing but supportive of us, even going as far as to offer to pay for whatever choice i end up making about the baby. we've both decided that i'll get an abortion and he's currently working on figuring all of that out while i'm still worrying about my entire fucking future. 

i don't know why but i just feel so incredibly alone at this moment despite having my boyfriend and his family. i can't my best friends because i don't want this to spread and i obviously have no familial support. i'm just so lost. what should i even do at this point? 

tl;dr: strict asian parents disowned me and kicked me out of the house after snooping and finding out i was pregnant. they've cut off all contact and refuses to pay for my college tuition. i fully plan on attending brown this fall after getting the abortion, but i have no money. i'm at a complete loss as to what to do. any advice appreciated.",7
"help: i slept with a guy nearly 48hrs ago and he won't leave my place!!!!. update here for alk who asked: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/apawjv/update_i_slept_with_a_guy_48hrs_ago_and_now_he/?utm_source=reddit-android

i am recently out of a long-term relationship, and its been a long time since i have 'dated', so i have been meeting guys from tinder for hook-ups and dates. i went on a date with this guy on friday night, and it was okay, he seemed nice and we ended up going back to mine and hooking up. anyway...fast forward to, well, now, and the dude is still here. i'm used to a guy staying for a while the next day, having coffee or whatever, but he slept over saturday night too, and now i'm worried he is going to end up staying tonight too. he's been here way too long now and i have no idea how to get rid of him. he used my toilet, and i had forgotten to put more paper in there...he called me to the toilet to give him some paper because he shit in my toilet. he shit in my toilet. that's how long he's been here...he's had a shit. idk i just think one nighters have overstayed their welcomes when they shit at your place. 

i have politely said on saturday 'i have a lot to be getting on with today', and 'i have some errands to run', but he didn't get himself ready to go or anything, and i really don't wanna leave him in my place unattended. i even got dressed, put my coat on and told him i was going out and he just asked if i could grab him a coffee on my way back (!!!!!!). i did say today that he should probably leave soon as i need to get myself sorted for work monday, and he just said 'yeah no problem'...but that was 3 hours ago and he is still chilling in my bed watching tv.

i'm really worried now because i need to go to work tomorrow and i'm scared that he won't ever leave. i told him that i need to work monday and he just changes the subject and asks about my work. how do i get him to leave? i've been in situations before where guys have turned in a bad way when i have refused advances, not given them my number etc, only this is worse because he is in my apartment and i am worried that he might turn nasty when we are alone. 

probs worth noting that i suspected nothing at dinner on friday night, he didn't seem like a weirdo or anything. guess i didn't realise i'd be gaining a live-in boyfriend after one date and some drunk mediocre sex. what is the best way to deal with all of this?

"visiting my little brother who is homeless and an addict.. my little brother is homeless and an addict.  he has been in and out of jail/rehab and on the streets for for a while now.  it appears that he has given up now and has no plans to do anything, but continue using and living on the streets.  it looks like his health is drastically declining.  he has lost 60-100 pounds in the last 6-8 months.  it appears that he is shooting up, i think meth, as he says, though, he was doing heroin, but said he stopped.  

i'm flying out to visit him for his birthday in a couple weeks.  but mostly, i'm flying out because i don't think he'll be around much longer.  i think this will be the last time i see my brother.  

i'm trying to figure out what my time with him should be like.  i know i need to have boundaries as to not be enabling, though i don't think i would be.  i more or less just don't know if i should be putting pressure on him to change or if i should just have it be a time where i'm present with him?  

i want to avoid causing him to feel more shame than he does.  i understand he probably feels very ostracised from family and all of life, really.  i'd like to show him compassion as much as possible, but i also want him to get better.

"my whole life. my regrets as a 46 year old, and advice to others at a crossroad. tifu. more like more whole life really.

hi, i my name's john. i've been lurking for a while, but i've finally made an account to post this. i need to get my life off my chest.  about me. i'm a 46 year old banker and i have been living my whole life the opposite of how i wanted. all my dreams, my passion, gone. in a steady 9-7 job. 6 days a week. for 26 years. i repeatedly chose the safe path for everything, which eventually changed who i was.

today i found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years. my son feels nothing for me. i realised i missed my father's funeral for nothing. i didn't complete my novel, travelling the world, helping the homeless. all these things i thought i knew to be a certainty about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties. if my younger self had met me today, i would have punched myself in the face. i'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon.

let's start with a description of me when i was 20. it seemed only yesterday when i was sure i was going to change the world. people loved me, and i loved people. i was innovative, creative, spontaneous, risk-taking and great with people. i had two dreams. the first, was writing a utopic/dystopic book. the second, was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless.
i had been dating my wife for four years by then. young love. she loved my spontaneity, my energy, my ability to make people laugh and feel loved. i knew my book was going to change the world. i would show the perspective of the 'bad' and the 'twisted', showing my viewers that everybody thinks differently, that people never think what the do is wrong. i was 70 pages through when i was 20. i am still 70 pages in, at 46. by 20, i had backpacking around new zealand and the phillipines. i planned to do all of asia, then europe, then america (i live in australia by the way). to date, i have only been to new zealand and the phillipines.

now, we get to where it all went wrong. my biggest regrets. i was 20. i was the only child. i needed to be stable. i needed to take that graduate job, which would dictate my whole life. to devote my entire life in a 9-7 job. what was i thinking? how could i live, when the job was my life? after coming home, i would eat dinner, prepare my work for the following day, and sleep at 10pm, to wake up at 6am the following day. god, i can't remember the last time i've made love to my wife.

yesterday, my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years. 10 years. that seems like a long time, but i can't comprehend it. it doesn't even hurt. she says it's because i've changed. i'm not the person i was. what have i been doing in the last 10 years? outside of work, i really can't say anything. not being a proper husband. not being me. who am i? what happened to me? i didn't even ask for a divorce, or yell at her, or cry. i felt nothing. now i can feel a tear as i write this. but not because my wife has been cheating on me, but because i am now realising i have been dying inside. what happened to that fun-loving, risk-taking, energetic person that was me, hungering to change the world? i remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school, but declining her for my now-wife. god, i was really popular with the girls in high school. in university/college too. but i stayed loyal. i didn't explore. i studied everyday. 

remember all that backpacking and book-writing i told you about? that was all in the first few years of college. i worked part-time and splurged all that i had earned. now, i save every penny. i don't remember a time i spend anything on anything fun. on anything for myself. what do i even want now?

my father passed ten years ago. i remember getting calls from mom, telling me he was getting sicker and sicker. i was getting busier and busier, on the verge of a big promotion. i kept putting my visit off, hoping in my mind he would hold on. he died, and i got my promotion. i haven't seen him in 15 years. when he died, i told myself it didn't matter what i didn't see him. being an atheist, i rationalized that being dead, it wouldn't matter anyway. what was i thinking? rationalizing everything, making excuses to put things off. excuses. procrastination. it all leads to one thing, nothing. i rationalized that financial security was the most important thing. i now know, that it definitely is not.
i regret doing nothing with my energy, when i had it. my passions. my youth. i regret letting my job take over my life. i regret being an awful husband, a money-making machine. i regret not finishing my novel, not travelling the world. not being emotionally there for my son. being a damn emotionless wallet.

if you're reading this, and you have a whole life ahead of you, please. don't procrastinate. don't leave your dreams for later. relish in your energy, your passions. don't stay on the internet with all your spare time (unless your passion needs it). please, do something with your life while your young. do not settle down at 20. do not forget your friends, your family. yourself. do not waste your life. your ambitions. like i did mine. do not be like me.

sorry for the long post, just had to get it out there.

tl:dr i realised i let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when i was younger, and now i am dead inside, old and tired.





edit: i am quite overwhelmed at the response, thank you for your time. i had posted on a whim, and did not expect the reception.

in regards to my post, i must admit i was quite emotional at the time. as i read what i had written earlier, i can't stop myself from noticing an abundance of spelling and grammatical mistakes, phrases that i would not usually say. i don't think i have used capital locks so much in my life. 
however i will not edit them. that would not do it justice.

i have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions. i will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life, reddit and humanity in general. the amount of encouragement and humour persists to amaze me. despite my situation, i even found myself laughing at a few of the comments.

what my plans are.
i am planning to cut down my hours substantially. i will take a new job if i have to, as i am relatively well-off. i am going to talk to my wife. divorce is currently not what i have in mind and i hope that our communication and relationship will improve. if it doesn't, then so be it. we will both move on. i see there are quite a number of negative comments about her, however i am going to have to say in her defence, she really is a lovely person. she is smart, empathetic and has a great sense of humour. i'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did, but she's not an evil person. i know that. we were both in the fault. we let communication dwindle, and with it, our relationship. there is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money. a steady balance of emotional connection, love and finance is what i will strive to give.

my son. i don't any anything about him. i really don't. i have unknowingly distanced myself from him; i only see him around dinner time. i do not recall having a proper conversation with him, it's quite preposterous now that i think about it. i'm not exactly sure how i'll start bonding with him, i have become quite a boring person. however, i plan to change that. i refuse to be a poor role model. i will ensure that he does not make the same mistake i did with my family. i have decided i am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on saturdays. i never have, due to work, but i will ensure that i do. perhaps i will even play video games with him. there was a time i had a collection of snes games, and i wasn't half bad either. who knows, i might really connect with my son, and it seems to be something he enjoys.

in regards to the novel and travelling, i admit, i am a different person from my youth. i no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel. when i found the long-forgotten 70 pages, the writing was no longer mine. i have changed substantially in 26 years. i am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it. however, i am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring writers that have expressed their passion!
the travelling, i might still do. family trips probably, in the school holidays. maybe with my wife every now and then, if she'd have me. 

i can't turn back time and see my father for a final time, though my mother is still alive. she lives in london, so visits are quite difficult. however, i will make an effort to see her. i do love my parents. i only wish i had not prioritised them as i did.

in regards to the advice i have given. i stand by what i said. live your life. do not procrastinate and let lethargy stop you. however, i might add, avoid living in poverty. i have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or homelessness. i would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be considerable more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards! i believe someone mentioned their dream was financial stability. i say, that is just as valiant as any dream to have. we are all different and are missing different things in our lives, be honest with yourself and you'll know what you really want.
i believe there were arguments upon my language and university/college or what not. i will clarify that, although australians generally call tertiary education 'university' here, i have made small efforts to pertain to americans, as they are the main users, at least i assume. and yes, university/college was free when i attended. i believe australians now are able to attend them relatively free (upfront) and can pay their fees after they graduate.

i believe i have covered the general scope of questions. 

p.s. thank you for the gold, i do appreciate it, but they aren't of real value to me. perhaps if reddit ever includes a re-gifting gold feature, i will gift them to some of the commenters. and yes, please stop sending me gold! i also believe someone tried to even donate to me? i assure you, money is not what i read. please save it for yourself!

i don't think i'll come back to reddit, unless i hear about a way to re-gift gold. i thank you all for your sympathy, your time, and i wish all the best for those in difficult situations. i have faith in your capacity and ability to change, to become happy, to help yourselves. because after all, you're the person in the best position to.
and no, i am not considering religion, i just do not have the correct mindset. i am logical to the point that i cannot, however that is not to say religion isn't bad, it gives people the hope and sense after death which i really do envy.

sincerest of regards,

john.

"adults (as in humans aged 18+) should not be offended by profanity. if they are, i don't feel badly about it.. using profanity doesn't make you trashy, uneducated or violent. it allows some of us to express language in a more efficient manner. it's so universal and powerful, which makes it very tempting to use, especially for those of us who struggle with effective communication in certain scenarios.

because of cultural intensity prescribed to the word ""fuck"", its utterance tends to be a verbally cathartic experience. do we need people to hate its use, though, in order for it to retain power? in my opinion, no. 

when i was 13, i didn't appreciate the power of profanity. i misused it in an attempt to feel important and more mature (older 🙄). at 32, i feel like i fully appreciate its role in efficient communication. 

it's important to understand the difference. ❤️

her best friends boyfriend left her a month ago after cheating on her with multiple different women. she's not in a good place to say the least. my girlfriend is spending a hell of a lot of time with her recently and not so much with me. (which is fine in my eyes, her best friend is in a crisis right now and she's being supportive.) my girlfriend said to her that she would ask me if i could spend a night with her to help her feel better, which was my girlfriends idea.


yesterday night we were together and she was talking about her friend with me and she was saying that she was lonely, felt rejected, and is desperate for attention. my girlfriend asked me if i found her friend at all attractive and i was a little taken back by it but she's a good looking girl (not as good looking as my girlfriend obviously) so i was kind of what just like 'yeah, sure'. she explained to me that she would ask me if i would sleep with her once just to help her feel better, and she went on to say that she's not only ok with it, but she really wants me to do this, going as far as to say 'please, do it for me if not for her'. she promised me that she's ok with it and she won't get jealous or anything. i told her i would think about it.


i guess i wouldn't mind just the once but i don't want to be pimped out every time her friend feels a little upset or lonely, i'm not just some toy to be shared. on one hand i would like to help but on the other hand this seems kind of out there. what would you do in this situation?


tldr: girlfriend wants me to have sex with her best friend to help her cope with a breakup, she seems fine with it and is encouraging me to do so. what would you do?


edit: i told her no, after reading only 5 comments",7

"for messing with my sister's fake profile?. going to try to make this quick. i'm 22 and my sister is 18. i went to my sister's room to grab a top she had borrowed(we do this all the time, borrow clothes go into each other's rooms to get them back) and i notice she has facebook open and the profile pic is...well..me. i have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. i know i shouldn't have but i snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake facebook profile of me.

i'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. i don't do social media. i'm a private person and i don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. other pictures that she had were ones i had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.

i delete all of the pictures and i check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food i had taken pictures of. i go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that i had taken for my boyfriend.

i deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. i uploaded a single picture of her with the caption ""the real me"", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. i've heard her sobbing from her room all day but i'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?

&#x200b;

update: i decided to confront my sister since i couldn't stand sitting around with a knot in my stomach. as soon as she saw me she started crying and begging me not to tell our parents and saying she was sorry. i told her that i don't think i could ever forgive her and that it made me sick to even look at her. i asked her why she had the fake profile. apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. he really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. she got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. i brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. i told her that i didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. i asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that i can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. she tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. at that point i just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. i told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. she got upset again and i left shortly after. 

&#x200b;

i saw people mentioning that i should change my password on my computer- i've done that. i've explained the situation to my boyfriend and he offered to let me move in with him which i'm probably going to take him up on. i can't be in the house anymore- i feel so uncomfortable and i feel so paranoid about running into people that she may have talked to or sent pictures to. 

&#x200b;

thank you for people that have sent kind words/messages/advice. i really appreciate it. today has been the worst day of my life, hands down. the relationship with my sister will never be the same and i don't think the uneasiness will ever go away.",3

"demoted today with a $9k pay cut - what are my options?. background: i've been with my current employer for almost 4 years. i was hired as a service techinician (servicing/installing bank equipment - locks, safes, pneumatic tube systems, burg/fire alarms, cctv, etc) and was promoted to service manager jan 1 2018.

i'm the third person to take (and now lose) this job since i've worked there - it's a small company of 6 employees, and the boss is a hothead and very hard to please. i knew this going in, but i figured for the money it was worth an attempt.

i was making $19/hr hourly working full time before, changed to $50k/yr salary once i took the manager job.

today, i had a pretty bullshit ""6 month review"" - he sat me down and basically said, ""i don't think this is working, so i'm making you a tech again, i'll pay you $20/hr. take the rest of today and tomorrow off, come wednesday we'll get you rolling in the field again."" he has his reasons, and i don't disagree that there were challenges in working together - but nothing was ever documented on paper, i would just have to sit through angry outbursts once in a while every time he didn't like the way i did something. most critically, i just took a $9000 dollar pay cut - having just purchased a car, and this puts a huge crunch on my finances. i'm going to spend some time today redoing my budget, and i already don't like how it's going to turn out.

here are my thoughts. if i stay here, that management experience withers away, and loses effectiveness on my resume the longer i continue as a technician.

going back to work there is going to be awkward. that much i can manage, but i see it causing some interpersonal drama now that i'm back working alongside 4 techs i was previously in charge of.

lastly, would this qualify as constructive dismissal? i understand that my job duties are changing as well as my pay - but this is an 18% pay cut that was decided unilaterally. would i be better served declining it and accepting dismissal, trying to survive off of unemployment while searching for something in the vain of what i was previously doing?

this is the first time something like this has happened to me, and while my head is spinning a little, i feel like i can make the best of the situation somehow - just need a little guidance.

i appreciate in advance any advice you can offer - and if there are any questions you have for me i'm happy to answer them.",10
"public school teachers are overpaid, not underpaid.. very unpopular opinion that i have literally received death threats for. 

public school teachers in the united states earn a median income around $56,000 per year.  this is far too high.  

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/high-school-teachers.htm

https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary

https://www1.salary.com/public-school-teacher-salary.html

i'm not saying what they do is not noble, important, or difficult.  i am saying they are paid too much compared to other professions.

1.  public school teachers are paid through tax dollars under contracts negotiated by unions with the power to strike. this artificially inflates their wages and benefits.  (the purpose of a union). it's revealed in the numbers.  private school teachers, who do not have the power to force a tax payer to pay more, earn far less.  some estimates are as low as $37,000.  

https://www.payscale.com/research/us/job=private_school_teacher/salary

teachers union convention, nea top official - it's not for the kids, it's for the power.

https://youtu.be/bam8n24k8ke

2.  the median household income in the united states is only about $62,000.  that means that one teacher's income is nearly equal to the median income of entire households, most of which contain two or more incomes.  

but wait billy mays, there's more. 

3.  teachers are required by contract to perform their job only about 180 days per year.  private sector non-education wage jobs have 260 work days per year.  business owners work up to 365 days
- all net of holidays obviously for simplicity since christmas and new years etc. happen for everyone - 

annualized pay to equal out the effort put in by private sector and self employed workers then reflects an equivalent of $89,500 and $125,700. 

and please, don't tell me ""teachers work 16 hours per day 364 for little johnnie doing lesson plans and grading papers.""  stop it.  third grade long division has not changed for 2 centuries.  1 lesson plan per career can literally handle a lot of subjects - and i know teachers who do just that. 

teaching is not easy, but it's not hard either.  and yes, before you say ""try it once and stand in my shoes"" - i have.  

4.  on average, teachers are not very good at what they do and take little to no responsibility for results.  they are more facilitators than professionals. 

""these kids get out of high school and can't even read.""  

proficiency in reading, math, science and other subjects varies depending upon what is tested and at what point in the education process it's measured, and varies greatly from state to state and city to city, but reading proficiency is often as low at 40%.  math often under 50%.  half or more of our public school students are being pushed out into the world whether they are prepared or not.  private schools do considerably better in every category across the board. 

it's because federal funding - for those sweet salaries and benefits - is tied primarily to graduation rates, not proficiency.  and when proficiency tests are proposed, teachers scream like a banshee that it's unfair to test teachers based upon whether their students have learned.  

you can peruse this trove of data if you like.  it's fascinating actually.  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/index.asp?faq=ffoption3#faqffoption3

""it's the parents, not us.""  

you'll often hear this in response.  and it's true, parents are extremely important in little johnnie's life and success.  but that does not mean a teacher is without responsibility.  they are typically trained for at least 4 and up to 8 years post-secondary to figure out how to get little billy the bully ready even when he's a dick and won't pay attention.  the gifted and smart kids are going to learn the material no matter what the teacher does or doesn't do, all she needs to do is competently facilitate for them.  her job is to get slow witted corky some knowledge because he can't learn on his own. 

5.  schools are becoming prison camps.  for what we pay for, public schools are providing less and less benefit and more and more hazards.  i don't think it's because there were no donnie the drug dealer and billy the bully when we generation xers were growing up.  it's because school administrations have slowly changed the culture of schools to a more institutionalized authoritarian culture.  there is a growing attitude of contempt for students and parents.  cops are everywhere.  students have few if any rights.  the kids are treated with disrespect and 'zero-tolerance' policies that effect their lives and their personalities forever.  it gets worse each year. 

i do not see the same thing happening in private schools.  i believe it's because private schools have customers, and public schools have captives - and the cliche that ""teachers are overworked and underpaid"" has given them a generally bad overall attitude of smug superiority and entitlement.  they have become adversarial.  

https://youtu.be/so_gkquuisc

like i said, i've had my life threatened for this opinion locally.  it's dogmatically accepted that teachers are heroes that are overworked and underpaid. 

yet they work fewer days, earn more than almost half of entire households, have unions negotiating the best benefits in the country, the kids are not learning, the experience of being a student is increasingly miserable, and their own top representatives admit its not about the kids, it's about the power.

"by drinking a 35 year old can of coke.. this story actually took place around this time last year, but because it's embarrassing nature, my coworkers haven't stopped reminding me about it. 

our office does a small secret santa goft exchange every year, that we typically arrange in november, and give out gifts in december. you write your name on a slip of paper, along with some gift ideas, and whoever gets your name generally gets you some kind of gift, without you knowing who got it for you. the budget for these gifts is $20, so it's not like anyone is getting something super fancy.

now, generally speaking, i'm pretty indecisive. ask me what i want for christmas, i'll probably say i don't know. ask me what i want within a $20 budget? i definitely have no idea. i remember writing on the slip ""idk, something cool?"" beneath my name, expecting to maybe get a gift card or something generic. 

when i get to my desk on the day of gift exchange, i see a can of coke with an image of santa on the can, sitting beside a card. i remember thinking to myself ""well, this is what i get for not being specific. may as well be appreciative of what i've been given."" 

i open up the card, which contains an cheesy line, fitting of the sense of humor of the people in my office. ""if you put me in the fridge, i make a ""cool"" gift!"" my eyes scan down the card, and i read the next line. ""p.s. i'm almost twice your age!"" now, this should have been my first clue. however, being the youngest person at my office (i'm 20), i took this line to be a clue as to who my secret santa was! after all, half the fun was trying to figure out who got you the gift. never in a million years would i have thought that line, was to be taken from the perspective of the can. 

so, i crack open the can. as i go to take a sip, i notice the metal on the outside smells off. i'm not sure how to describe the smell, aside from how one might imagine an old garage would smell. this should have been my second clue, but instead i picture someone keeping their soda in a second fridge in their garage, something i had known many of my friend's fathers to do. of course, these were sodas we weren't allowed to drink, so i rationalize to myself that this particular can perhaps sat in a fridge in someone's garage long enough to soak of some of the, erm, garage smell? after a moment of hesitance, i remember once more that i should be appreciative of the gift, and take a sip. 

now, it feels important to note here, that i don't really drink coke. if anything, i drink pepsi, but i'm not really the biggest fan of dark sodas. i'm generally a sprite or even mountain dew kind of guy. the first sip, as far as i'm concerned, didn't really set off any alarm bells. maybe i was just in denial, but it wasnt until a few sips in that i truly became aware the soda was... off. i think to myself that it's the odd garage smell of the can that's got the soda tasting strange, as smell is a big part of taste, right? so, deciding i don't want to offend whoever it was that gave me the gift, i chug down the rest of the can as quickly as possible. 

now, it isn't until about an hour later that one of my supervisors approaches me, presumably for something unrelated, and looks in absolute horror at the can on my desk. i'm confused of course, until they explain that they collect coke memorabilia, including some of the older unopened cans with specific designs. they point out the ps on the card that was, apparently meant to indicate the age of the can and not the age of the person... i try to laugh it off, but, the judgement in the eyes of my supervisor is clear. after googling around, i managed to find the exact santa can. if i recall correctly, it had been about 35 years old, give or take a year.

the bright side is, surprisingly, the soda didn't make me sick at all. the downside is, even a year after the fact, i have yet to live this down. everyone in the office knows i drank this ancient soda, and even our new hires are quickly filled in. i wouldn't say it's what i'm known for at the office, but it's definitely still present in the minds of my coworkers!

tldr; someone gave me a collectible can of coke for secret santa, and not wanting to be impolite at the odd gift of a soda, i drank it.",4
"ex-wife's new wife is attempting blackmail. background: i transitioned to sahd for several years when my wife began work as an attorney. we mutually agreed to a divorce a couple years ago and remained close. because i'd put my own education and career on hold for her, plus a fair amount of debt accrued based on trying to make my ex's plans-on-a-whim work so that i could stay near our kids, i'm starting from rock bottom. i've lived with my in-laws for quite a while as i'm finishing my long-delayed ba while trying to transition out of retail and into better-paying work so i can afford a place of my own. she started a relationship with a woman, ""judith,"" in the finance industry who offered to mentor me into entering the industry as well. neither my ex nor i realized that judith was giving me misleading advice while badmouthing me to my ex and her business contacts. a few months later it came out that judith was manipulating and physically abusing my ex. my ex ran, but she decided to return after a week. since then, judith has made infrequent contact with me via text and email, swinging between attempts at intimidation and playing nice. i currently live in upstate ny with the in-laws. my ex, her wife, and the kids live in ma.

the incident in question happened a couple weeks ago. judith sent me an email saying that she was giving me 30 days' notice to move out of the in-laws' and into a new place. (i had been open with them, before judith's behavior came to light and after, about my financial situation and how i was finally saving enough to move out early this year.) if i'm not out by that time, judith said, she'll tell my in-laws that i was emotionally and sexually abusive to their daughter (my ex) during our marriage.

(edit: her threat was slightly more subtle than that - it was basically, ""would her parents continue to let you live there if someone told them this? probably not!"" and in the immediate follow-up email, ""you have 30 days to get out."" so it may not be quite so cut and dry. otherwise i would have probably just gone straight to a lawyer or the police.)

because the context is internal to a family situation, i'm not sure how or whether the law on coercion applies. i've briefly looked at the coercion statutes for both ny and ma, as well as the federal statute. i may have been married to an attorney, but i don't know enough myself to even figure out where jurisdiction would lie in this situation. i don't know what steps i should take or when. any advice?",2

"i am dying and have told nobody.  this might be somewhat long, but i basically just made this reddit account to talk about it. some introductions, first, i'm 22/m and for the greater part of a year i had noticed myself growing gradually weaker. i am an avid golfer who used to be able to hit drives upwards of 290-300 yards, now i'm lucky to hit it 220-230. in addition, i am also someone who used to enjoy jogging, until multiple repetitive falls more or less forced me to quit. there are other symptoms that raised concern but i won't bore anyone with the extensive details. at any rate, about six months i had my initial consultation with my neurologist and he was very dismissive of my symptoms, saying they were likely caused by anxiety and to not read further into it. after some protest on my part, he acquiesced and agreed to perform some diagnostic testing in a few months if nothing had improved.

four months go by, and, of course, things got worse. perplexed, my neurologist ordered an emg, which, if you did not know, is a test which involves measuring the activity of nerves in the body through the use of needle electrodes. sounds awful, truly was not that bad. as the test began, the technician was very amicable and talkative, but as soon as the first needle went into my arm, her demeanor changed immediately, as if any levity had suddenly been drained from her. that was the first time i began to truly worry. upon completing the test she immediately sent the results to my neurologist, who, that very same day, arranged for additional testing including, but not limited to: mri, extensive neurological exam, strength tests, and an additional emg, the whole shebang, to be completed within the week. 

at any rate, following the completion of the second emg, this time by my neurologist himself, i was summoned into his office. after jotting down some quick notes and doing some mental aerobics, he asked very politely for me to sit down, and before the words even left his mouth i immediately knew what was going to come out. and that's essentially the story of how i went from being a perfectly 'normal' 22 yo to being told that i had lou gehrig's disease and 3-5 years of life left.

all things considered, i consider myself extremely fortunate that i still have most of faculties about me, for the time being. but onto the reason i made this post, since my diagnosis, which was about two months ago, (12/28/16), i have yet to tell anyone in person about it. my family and i have never been particularly close and most of my friends are college buddies who now live close to 500 miles away. of course, everyone is bound to find out eventually, but i would honestly be okay if they never did. the mere thought of burdening everyone as i slowly turn into furniture is almost more debilitating than the knowledge that my body is growing slightly more useless everyday. i know it is the right choice to garner a support system, but it's almost as if i don't really want one. i just want to disappear, forgotten by all those who would otherwise pity my circumstances. i'm fully aware that i have no choice in the matter, this is just my way of exercising some minor control over my life before i lose control over everything else.

i introduced myself and welcomed him also i've asked him about his day and we had a short conversation he was so happy that i was able to communicate with him using his language, i was working as a translator and helping him understand the procedures and some of the doctor instructions and i was making sure to keep him updated with everything.

he was so happy and i was so happy because i made him happy, i've also encouraged his sister to learn sign language in order to communicate with him more. 

he told me at the end of the visit that none of his family speak sign language unfortunately and they keep delaying it whenever he ask them to learn the language he said seeing people from the hearing community learning sign language make him so happy he added  ""thank you for helping me toady, i've came multiple times to this clinic before but today was very special and different, i felt so welcomed ""

so - first off i wasn't totally honest about my relationship with my landlord. this was probably pretty obvious the more i commented but we're actually really close friends. like i spend holidays with his family. so yeah, that's how i knew he wasn't just fucking me over to get more money. 


anyway, i met with a lawyer. i like him. he basically said the same thing as everyone here - nyc is really tenant friendly, and if this makes it to court (unlikely, you'll see why) it won't be hard to fight. i don't think i'd want to fight though. i probably have nothing to worry about but i would just peacefully move if it does happen.

this wasn't a call i wanted to make surrounded by all of my coworkers while we stood around outside so i texted his sister instead and we made plans to talk later. long story short, she'd gotten some weird messages from him lately (like him congratulating her on a promotion then getting angry when she had no idea what he was talking about). once she heard about steve and the eviction, she made plans to fly out to us the next day. 


this is getting long (sorry), so jumping a bit - she told him some story and convinced him to fly back to ca with her. before he left he apologized for blowing up at me and said that we could talk about the dog when he got back and try to work it out but that it was shitty that i did it behind his back especially when it was against the lease and he couldn't rent to someone he couldn't trust. 


i asked his sister about the eviction (just in case) and she said of course i wasn't evicted and to just hold down the fort. 


anyway - so he's at a place near his family being treated now. i don't know what for and i don't really care as long as he's getting better. that's his business and he'll tell me if he wants to. i just want him to be okay and it looks like he will be. 


(i do know it's nothing environmental because i've had the whole place tested for everything. also i've been staying there and i'm still fine.) 


his family is awesome and reaching out to me almost daily. i haven't been able to talk to him since he left, but hopefully soon. i'm also going there for thanksgiving so i'll most likely even get to see him. 


and when he's back we can maybe start looking for our new dog steve. 


thanks again for all the help. not trying to sound dramatic but i'm not sure if i would have done the right thing if i hadn't posted here.",2
wikipedia is a much more credible source than almost all of the clickbait poorly constructed garbage sites.. i am so sick of seeing teachers not want to use wikipedia as a source. it has its flaws but still so can any other website. and they always say that you should take the sources from the wikipedia page itself but why? that's where the page got it from. yet some random website with billions of ads made from someone no one knows is better than a strictly moderated website with a large community who can amend false facts on a dime?,6
"buying a house ""responsibly"" impossible for many?. so i've been doing some back of the envelope math, and am thinking that if you live in the west coast, northeast, chicago, honolulu, or denver, you need to be literally made of money and sweat solid gold to ever even dream of home ownership.   

so where i live, of the three city / county areas i'd want to live to not be an hour away from work, and even looking primarily in areas with bad schools for...reasons, the average house cost is $500k for a wwii era run-down shoebox of around 1200 square feet.  and we don't even crack the top 10 list of most expensive areas!

going by pf logic, i then need:

* 20% downpayment = $100k
* 3% closing costs = $15k
* 1% of the cost of the house annually for repairs = $5000
* property tax, school tax, asshole tax, you-lookin'-at-me-kid tax, etc:  $925 a month or $11k annually
* mortgage payment and insurance: $2500 per month or $30k annually

then you need 6-12 months of expenses saved for an emergency fund.  so call it 12 to be safe, and we need $30k mortgage + $11k taxes + $5k repairs + $36k other living expenses = $81k.  

so let's add all these up and see how much we have to save before we can buy our first (crappy, 1200 sq ft, wwii era) house!  

$100k down payment + $81k emergency fund + $15k closing costs + $5k repair costs = **$201k**.  just to get in the door and still owe $400k!  

let's say the average person can save 10% of their monthly after-tax income.  how long does somebody have to save before they can responsibly dream of owning a house?  


* let's say you make the us median of ~$50k.  at $50k salary = $35k take home = $3500 annually — a mere **54 years**!
* oh, well, what if you make more?  how about $75k, the median for an individual with a doctorate degree?  **38 years**.
* or what if you have an mba and make the median $100k that folk with professional degrees make?  **29 years**.
* what if you're in the top 1.5% for income and make $200k annually?  **11 years!**

even if you can save 20% of your after-tax income, you'll just cut these numbers in half.  

what is the average time before changing jobs?  well if you're above 25 and relatively stable, between 70%-87% of people will still change jobs within 5 years.  so you're between 10% and 45% of your house-saving goal by the time you'll get a new job and have to relocate anyways.  

conclusion:  homeownership in highly populated / coastal areas is essentially impossible for 99% of the population to strive for ""responsibly.""  

judging by the numerous all-cash no contingencies offers the crappy shoeboxes all around me get within 48 hours of listing, i'm going to hazard a guess that either nobody is buying a home ""responsibly"" or the rich are buying up literally every property everywhere and we're all doomed to be serfs to wealthy landowners forevermore.  and that is my cheerful thought of the day!  :-d

i hope this doesn't break rules of the subreddit. i also hope this never happens to any of you as the entire thing can be really stressful. the identitytheft.gov website is a true breath of fresh air.

basically some dickweed employee put my dl number and name (that's it) on 2 gold's gym memberships totally $7,000 (commission?). these memberships were made 2 weeks apart. some debt collectors i guess purchased the debt from gold's gym and think this cash grab is worth pursuing.

debt collectors will threaten you with:

- may have to appear in court
- may have to pay court charges, legal fees, and more
- get my credit rocked
- potential seizure, freezing, and sale of personal assets

legal, credit, finance - all scary stressful stuff in this context.

if you go to the identitytheft.gov(https://identitytheft.gov) though, you can talk to an **actual person**. they also have this extremely easy wizard to click through your situation and it will auto-generate a ""recovery plan"" including dispute letters, steps to contact law enforcement, putting credit freezes, and basically protecting yourself. it also explains your rights pretty well too.

"for feeding my sons vegan friend meat?. hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, i'm not one to really do this but i'm genuinely wondering if i'm in the wrong.


so my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. for context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


i don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables i normally cook - pretty much all i ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. we said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. we told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


well, that night was meatloaf night. with homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. i offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. so, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were pissed. they said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? even though it was his choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think i should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. i also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some i'm not going to say no. so what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?",3

"step father's grandson is ""home-schooled"" by his daughter. child is 8 years old, can't count beyond 20. doesn't fully know the alphabet, and doesn't really know how to play/interact with other kids because he spends most of his time at home in a small apartment.. (note i say step father but my mom is not married to him. they live separately but i still call him my step dad)  

his daughter used to live with him until my step dad demanded she get a job or go to school. she instead left with her son and moved in with and married her boyfriend. it was around this time that he had to start preschool, and she said that she was going to home school him and she's been home schooling him ever since. 

fast forward three years and their relationship has gotten better so she'll occasionally drop him off to visit. he's 8 now and i've noticed how far behind he is. i'm a high school senior and do a lot of volunteering at elementary schools. so when he comes to visit i like to spend my time teaching him. i taught him the basic alphabet, first couple numbers, etc. these are things he should know already. he learns very quickly and enjoys it. so i don't suspected he has any learning disabilities. i also read to him and once gave him a book as a gift. 

a few visits later while talking to him i come to find out that all he knows is what i've taught him and that the book i gave him is the only thing he's been reading because that's the only book he owns. he also tells me that he doesn't do ""learning time"" with his mom. ( ""learning time"" is what i call it when i teach him )

my friend has a younger brother the same age so i'll have her bring him over when he's visiting. while they play he acts like he's a toddler compared to him. i didn't think much of it until  my friends little brother asked him if he has any friends and he said no. he tells him that he stays at home all day. 

my step father notices this, and so does my mom and friend. we didn't say anything to each other not wanting to be rude or sound paranoid but the conversation came up and my step dad admitted he's been feeling horrible about it ever since. he wants to take action but doesn't want to get his daughter in trouble. she's living off welfare and i forgot to mention that she's legally blind. ( not completely but enough to give her disability ) he's also scared she won't let him see his grandson anymore if he mentions it. 


i'm really worried about him but i don't know what can be done and neither does my step dad. he doesn't care for her and only wants what's best for his grandson. he would want to get custody but he works two jobs at the moment and wouldn't have the time to care for him. 

we live in nevada. clark county district. what happens if we call cps? is there any legal way to make her enroll him in school? and is there a chance that if they see she's not educating him that they'll take him away?",2
"update aita, i flew 1k miles to visit a girl, arrived here and saw another guy has also come to see her but i don't want her to spend any time with him. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cn59tp/aita_i_flew_1k_miles_to_visit_a_girl_arrived_here/?st=jzismolp&sh=acd7fa42

i got home a few days ago and wanted to give everyone an update. the rest of the week was pretty much the three of us again, except for one other night where we were alone. so essentially in a week we only had two nights out together (i slept in her house so we spent nights alone anyway but i mean going out alone without third wheel).

i decided to do what a lot of you were suggesting and i confronted the other guy about wtf was going on. i guess something didn't feel right and my gut was telling me i should probably talk to him because i felt she was lying. so i went out on a ""walk to the shops"" and ended up at the guy's hotel and room.

straight up asked him what's going on, it was incredibly awkward but we ended up having a good conversation about her and he basically was told the same as i was. except she lied and said i purposely told her i couldn't afford a room and she ""had to offer me her place"". this isn't true, she offered me her place from the get-go and i never insinuated i wouldn't get a hotel room. she told him she liked him, was incredibly flirtatious with him too and they actually took it much farther than we did. they had a lot of phone sex, he had her nudes (he didn't show me out of respect for her), and they cammed a lot. a lot more than she did with me. i felt heartbroken, still do but i'm feeling better. on this trip alone they actually had sex when she was at his room, he confirmed it with a text she sent him when she left to go out with me. he does really like her, i'm not sure if she likes him back but she did sleep with him so maybe, she never did strike me as that type of person yet here we are, i told him he could have her.

so yeah. in essence, she lied a lot. she told me she really liked me, told him she doesn't like me at all. was incredibly flirty with both of us and leading us both on. she told him she didn't want me at her house yet totally invited me to stay there. she told me she didn't like him, he's just a friend visiting, but then turns out she's had a sexual relationship with him for months and they even slept together while i was also there. it's shit.

shit update and it's 100% what you lot expected and were telling me was gonna happen. turns out i am really fucking stupid however i'm working on it and you can bet i won't make the same mistake again.

"i triggered my wife's ptsd and she pulled a knife on me.. i feel like a monster for causing this. my wife and i are newly married and very young. she spent 3 years of her life living with with a physically, sexually, and emotionally abusive boyfriend named alex who made her life hell, and it has really affected her life in many negative ways. she is not on any kinds of medication although she probably should be, but i have always been very cautious of her ptsd and do my best to not trigger any of it. i honestly feel like i failed last night as a husband. we were laying on the couch watching tv and somehow this escalated to us play fighting (we like to wrestle a lot so this wasn't new). all of a sudden we were standing up and i grabbed her arms and pinned her against the wall with what i now see as a little too much force. i don't think i'll ever be able to get rid of the picture of the change in her eyes. she went from laughing and having fun to absolute and utter fear. her breath got short and her skin went pale, her eyes widened and before i could say anything they started welling up with tears. i let go and she ran out of the room. i decided to follow because i had no idea what was going on in that instant. she ran into the kitchen and i followed, when all of a sudden she grabbed a knife from the drawer and yelled, ""get away from me alex! (her exes name)"" because of instruction she had given me months before in case of an episode, i knew i had to stop this the way she told me to, so i ran to her before she could do anything and pulled the knife away and hugged her, immobilizing her so she wouldn't do anything to hurt herself or me. after a few seconds of struggling, we fell to the ground, she hyperventilated, and sobbed in my arms. a few hours later she was back to normal.

my main point for posting here is because i need to get off my chest the fact that i had done something that reminded her of her terrible ex. it makes me feel disgusting. as her husband i'm supposed to protect her and i feel like i failed at this. although it's nice to share the experience, i can't help but tear up thinking about it. i used to be a person who didn't give much thought to people with ptsd. most of the time i thought it was just an act or a way to get attention, and i would say it wasn't real unless you got it in war or a car crash or something. i'm grateful i'm an advocate and a friend to those who suffer with ptsd. and as a friend i would also like some advice on how to help my wife and how to avoid triggering her again. thank you for listening, and any support would he greatly appreciated.

update: the support we are receiving from this community is incredible. y'all have reduced a grown man to tears seeing how many people love and care for us. we will take each of yalls suggestions into consideration and will update when we decide what is best for us. y'all are amazing and have a special place in my heart. thank you.

edit: for those helping me understand that going at her when she had the knife is a terrible idea, i understand i shouldn't have. thank you and if it happens again i'll take a more subtle approach. 

edit: for those who are criticizing how i handled the situation in whole, you are not my spouse and do not know who my wife is. she has asked me to take control physically because it helps her to calm down. it is what she asked me to do and what i will continue to do because she needs me to.

"if i report my doorman for calling me pretentious?. i moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. it's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. i always say a pleasant, ""hi, how are you? have a nice day/evening"" to them when i leave or enter the building, but i don't stop to chat to them as i have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200b;

one of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as i'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. i usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as i'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200b;

the other day he shouted out to me, ""come here, miss pretentious,"" so this time i turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""what did you call me?"" he then proceeds to say i'm pretentious and obviously think i'm better than everyone else in the building because i won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. his tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. i politely explained that it's not that i think i'm better than everyone but that i'm just really tired after work and want to go home. i also said i find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as i'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if i wanted to). he ended by saying that i won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if i keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. i told him (again, politely) that i wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and i then walked away.

&#x200b;

since then i have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""hello, miss pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as i walk into the building. i have completely ignored him both times.

&#x200b;

i feel like i should probably talk to him and tell him i don't appreciate being called that, but honestly i just want to report him to his supervisor as i'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and i feel like i shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building). so if i just go ahead and report him? i don't want to get him fired or anything, but i do want him to stop.",3

"for telling my sister a ""wedding tattoo"" is a curse (even though i have one), and now the curse is coming true?. my partner and i are in our 30s and we live in a country where gay marriage is illegal. we got engaged years ago knowing we wouldn't be able to marry, but we set a ""wedding"" date and had a party for friends and family. instead of an actual ceremony, we got matching tattoos. we had been together 7 years when that happened, and it's been another 6 years since then.

anyway, my sister has been with her husband for just under 2 years. they got engaged almost as soon as they started dating, and they married 3 months ago. however, they're both not into wearing rings, so my sister suggested to her husband to get tattoos instead.

i jokingly told her that it's a curse (that getting a tattoo of a boyfriend/husband/partner's name will result in a break-up) and she said that my relationship is still going strong despite the curse. i said yeah, but we were together for 7 years when we got the tattoos, and btw we didn't tattoo each other's names but something else (a picture of a memory we have together), whereas she was going for straight-up ""samuel <3 21.6.19"" in huge thick letters across her wrist. i told her not to do it, and to just wear her wedding band on a necklace or something, but she told me to piss off, and did it anyway.

fast forward, her marriage is falling apart. nothing happened, they just seem to be realizing they're not a good fit, and it's only a question of time when they'll divorce. they don't even live together anymore, he moved out 3 weeks into their marriage.

now, my sister is blaming me for subconsciously influencing her and making her marriage fail. she thinks that me saying it was a curse subconsciously made her act towards her husband in a certain way that resulted in him being pushed away and not loving her anymore. i've never heard of something like this before. i very much doubt i have this superpower of destroying relationships. but my sister is currently going around telling our relatives i'm the asshole that ruined her marriage.

"deepthroating my boyfriend after eating chocolate ice cream on valentine's day. as one might think on valentine's day in particular, people like to get up to some frisky business, myself included. after indulging in some post-dinner beer and chocolate ice cream, my boyfriend and i (f) decided to have an ""oral sex party"".  we felt creative and made up a card game that allowed us to test the luck of the draw. ~card game rules at the bottom~
each number card drawn would result in that amount of minutes of oral play performed on the partner, and if a face card was drawn, additional special features could be implemented during that turn, such as toys or fingers. each turn consisted of drawing a card and pleasuring the other orally until the timer was up. then switch and repeat until we couldn't take it anymore and would inevitably fuck. pretty straight forward.

a few turns in, i had only drawn low numbers and was itching to give him longer blowjobs as he was drawing high cards and face cards. i had just drawn a 4 which followed his 8 minute king turn, so i was incredibly turned on and really just wanted to pleasure him as he deserved. i was having the time of my life, and he clearly was too, so i went off script and ignored the 4 minute timer. i kept going deeper and deeper until i was feeling him down my throat. turned on by my own accomplishments of getting him that far back, i kept deepthroating him and when he told me he was going to cum, in my own enthusiastic dick swallowing vigor, i accidentally jammed him back to the feeling i knew there was no return from. a volcanic surge immediately erupted and i tried my darndest to swallow it back but there was just too much. i pulled back and tried, to catch it in my hands but was unsuccessful and left staring at a brown mess of the ice cream and cum on my white sheets.

luckily my boyfriend is the sweetest ever and after a quick pic\*, cleanup, and laundry cycle, we cuddled and enjoyed the rest of the night together.

\--&gt;after it happened i realized i could reap the sweet karma benefits of my misfortune and decided it was best to gather photo proof of such event. also was drunk and thought it was a good/funny memory to capture. albeit disgusting...

because y'all nasty asses wanted to see the aftermath(https://imgur.com/a/ggwdssr). it looks like shit so don't say i didn't warn you.


i guess it's inevitable with stories like these that end up blowing up to assume it's made up. here is the text(https://imgur.com/a/nqmulpq) i sent my bf asking for his approval to post because it doesn't just involve me, so i wanted to make sure he was comfortable with my sharing first. 3 years together and we continue to work on our communication and keeping each other in the loop. 

card game rules-
shuffle the desk of cards, either use half or full deck. however you're feeling in the moment. each player draws a card to flip over simultaneously. highest card is the giver in the first turn.

alternate drawing cards and going down on each other for the number of minutes you draw on your card. if you draw a face card, these were the special rules. to be changed as is fit for your relationship. ours were as follows-

jack was either only hands or only mouth for that turn. queen was the option to add a toy-vibrator for me, plug for him. king was the classic pinky in ass, other fingers in my pussy. or for him, my finger in his ass, a recent addition to our sexual escapades which i love. ace was getting to fuck, then going back to oral after that turn.

each face card that was drawn was followed by the drawing of a number to figure out how long that would last.

our rule was no cumming during the game so we could edge as long as possible before the inevitable fuck. that didn't end up happening past a few rounds...clearly.

"increase your offers to help a friend who is mourning about 6 weeks after the death of their loved one. this is the point at which the initial wave of support has died off and people are particularly vulnerable.. a wise leader of a church taught me this.  he had helped many through the grieving process. when a close friend of mine lost a loved one tragically, i asked him what i should do to help them.  he taught me that often, the hardest time for people while grieving was when the initial wave of condolences had gone away and people don't really know/forget to offer help anymore.  meanwhile, the person grieving has to start trying to transition back to ""normal life"" and routines and they are often left more lonely than ever. **(note , i have noticed that this jump in time to support can be much sooner that six weeks, sometimes it is a soon as a few day).


to be clear, offering to help initially is great and important as well but consistent continued support is priceless. 

edit:  i wish i could **hug** all of you through the screen.  so many of you have shared your advice about your personal struggles with loved ones.... thank-you.

"no regrets i won the lottery 5 years ago and haven't told anyone. i just got engaged. no regrets so after taxes my winnings came to just shy of 4 million. i paid off all my debts, hired an accountant, fixed some things on my truck, and put most of it in savings. 

i kept my job, didn't move, and kept my fucking mouth shut. 

my brother is a meth head, my sister is a spiteful whore, and my mom still blames everything on my dad who died ten years ago so i didn't want them scrambling to pretend to give a shit about me for cash.

i've been dating a girl for about 3 years now and recently asked her to marry me, she said yes. i bought a modest ring, just over what people would expect given my known employment.

this weekend i'm going to lay everything out for her and i can truly know she's in it for me and not the money. it's going to liberating to be able to buy what i want and take care of my friends, totally worth the wait

"my (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22m) tried to spike my drink.. this is a throwaway, my boyfriend also has a reddit account. i am sorry for how long it is but please read this, i need advice. 

updates at the bottom of the post.

i have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now and started hanging out with his friends, all guys, a few months after we started going out. there is usually at least 4 of us at one of our places, drinks, snacks and music every friday evening. my boyfriend is out of town for the weekend and the guys invited me anyway. we were at the friend in question's place, let's call him s. s has always been very nice to me, a bit flirty in the beginning but i just brushed it off and it didn't last long anyway. he plays guitar and i play instruments as well so we always show each other our compositions.

so yesterday when i went to his place, there was another friend and everything seemed fine, we were drinking and hanging out until around 1 am when other friend says he's heading home as he works on saturdays. not wanting to make anything awkward and as everyone was a bit buzzed, i say i should leave too to talk to my boyfriend and let him know i'm home okay. s says i should stay a bit more as he wants to show me the last piece he wrote, i agree and sit back on the couch. s brings his guitar then asks if i want something else to drink, i tell him i am okay and he insists he has an amazing whisky that i need to try, he then goes to the kitchen to bring it. in the mean time, i start heading for the toilet and catch a glimpse of him dropping something in my drink, it dissolves and he smells the glass, i quickly close the toilet door before he could notice me. now i was tipsy but still very aware of my surroundings, and i am 100 percent sure of what i saw. he brought the two glasses and kept watching me, not knowing what to do i ""accidently"" dropped it, apologized profusely and said i should really head home and l started heading for the door. s grabs my arm and is very insistant i should stay, he keeps telling me i should spend the night, how my boyfriend doesn't need to know, that i am really hot and how horny he is. i push him and run to the door then call an uber and head home.

i don't know what to do from here, i couldn't sleep all night and i keep imagining worse case scenarios. i don't know if i should tell my boyfriend or if he would even believe me and how he would react, i haven't heard from s yet and i don't know if i can even look him in the eyes. all i know is i am not going to be able to act normally and i am sure my boyfriend will know something is wrong. i really need some advice.

edit: update actually, thank you for the comments, the advie was very appreciated. i called my boyfriend and told him everything. he believes me and he was very supportive over the phone but hr is very upset, he says i should have told him right away and that he's coming back to ""beat the shit out of him"" and insists we go to the police. this is basically what i was afraid of, i am pretty sure he's going to go to s's place directly, he is 2 hours away. and i can't stop him because it's not like i can go there myself, but at least he says he is here for me.

second edit, another update: thank you all for the wonderful advice and support. we're going to the police station, i am writing this on our way, i am terrified and it's late, this has been a tough day but my boyfriend has been amazingly supportive although he is very angry. we agreed that we wouldn't contact him directly and bf said he would call his other friends to let them know after we talk to the police. this is going out of proportions and i am honestly shaking while writing this but i hope this is the right choice. i am still scared to ruin someone's life over this and i don't know if anything will be done but you guys were right to open my eyes that he might have done it to someone else or will in the future. my bf is very adament on taking it in his own hands if the police don''t do something so i hope they can and i will make another post when an update is necessary. thank you again, i would not have done this without the support here.",7

"if i tell my bio daughter that i don't want to help her or have her in my life because she decided that her stepmom should adopt her once she turned 18?. my ex husband and i divorced when my daughter was only 5yo. it was a messy divorce which ended in him getting primary custoy. i could have her every other weekend. our marriage hit the rocks after the death of my twin sister. depression hit me hard and i became an alcoholic. i willingly gave him primary custody so that she could have a better life. from then on, i strived to improve my life. i did aa, went to rehab and i've been sober for a long time now. by the time my daughter was 9, i was completely sober. i looked forward to our visits. i was really heartbroken that i didn't get much time with her. 

he remarried and i was really happy that she had a good family to take care of her. but over the years, her stepmom completely replaced me. she called her mom( i don't resent it, but it definitely stung ). she completely took my place at her school events, and after a while, my daughter didn't even inform me about anything in her life. i could clearly tell that she was no longer eager to visit me. i was not financially strong and could not afford all the things that her stepmom could afford for her.

at her graduation, she introduced her as her mother to other parents and i only got one picture with her. i was crushed. and when she turned 18, she asked her stepmom to adopt her. that broke my heart. she did not contact me much after that.

i moved to a different state after that. moved on with my life and i met an amazing man who is now my husband. we have a daughter together. i've completely moved on and i don't resent anyone. i have a great job, a loving husband and an adorable daughter. i'm content. i don't regret or resent anything. 

recently, my bio daughter contacted me and wanted to meet up wuth me. she's 28 now. according to her, she was kicked out of her house after my husband divorced her mother. she fell into depression, did drugs, skipped college and she's jobless. she's pregnant now and she wants me to help her. she apologized to me because she hurt me at that time. according to her, her mother manipulated her. 

idk. i don't feel any connection between us now. honestly, i've moved on and that chapter of my life is closed now. i don't want to open that wound ever. i don't think it will do any good for my mental health and i'm scared of the impact it might have on my young daughter. i don't think i can or should have her back in my life. here??

edit: i've talked to my ex and he told me that the step mom was a gold digger and cheated on him. but my daughter dropped out of college on her own because of her depression and started doing drugs. he tried to help her out but she never improved. so he finally kicked her out an year ago and never contacted her again. he adviced me not to take her in. he doesn't know that she's pregnant.

edit2: i'm helping her find a place to stay and a sponsor for support group. i'm not letting her stay with me for now. i have explained to her that if she's not sober she will lose the custody of the baby and she told me that she'll do her best. thanks for all the replies.

"a goal towards a tidier home is not through periodic 'binge cleaning' but by keeping the house clean through small, everyday tasks.. to have a tidy, livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors, you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday.

for example: if you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game, put it back after use.

if you use a blanket, fold it up after you get up. anything that is displaced when in use - even a pencil or a remote.

instead of piling dishes in the sink, try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it. this will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after you're done cooking. 
extra protip: if you have something on the kitchen counter, put it where it belongs (even in the sink) so that your counter is always clear. even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters, it's still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters.

what this leaves is a tidier, clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming, dusting, and/or mopping. when unexpected visitors arrive, you don't have to scramble.

i never have to do much in my room. my closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place. i have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later. it works for them but i don't think thats an efficient method.

of course its harder when there are more people in the house, but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce.

edit: massive response, thanks! the point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1) doesn't buildup 2) helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3) makes your home's default setting as 'clean' :) 

also, if your house is massively cluttered, then it's a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday. it's said that if you do something for long enough, say 40 days, it becomes a habit. 
edit 2: when you rely on binge cleaning, your mindset is that you don't want to do it now because you can do it later. this makes you less likely to clean as you go. whats the point when you can do it later? so the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself.
also i missed a word in the title, sorry!

"my sister got kicked out of her gym, they refuse to give her a refund for it after they renewed it themselves. i will be using a throwaway for this due to privacy concerns.

my sister is overweight, weighing in at nearly 400 pounds. it is a very embarrassing thing for her, and it's always been a struggle to help her shed weight. her endo has diagnosed her with severe thyroid problems along with hormonal imbalances that have been difficult to treat even with various medications. so a part of her current weight loss regiment is to exercise at a gym as recommended by her gp and her endocrinologist. she has enrolled at (x) gym a few weeks ago.

right away, she has claimed that she has had run-ins with a group of catty women. my sister has depression and anxiety, formed partly due to intense bullying from classmates and co-workers as well as abuse from our parents. so she tends to get overly nervous and makes mistakes. so my sister began to misuse the equipment accidentally, and the women tear into her in a very mean way. my sister apologizes but these women report her to the gym who reprimand my sister.

so for many days, my sister was being belittled and insulted by this group. they continued to report her and make her feel bad. still she tried to ignore it because her health depended on this. one day, my sister got filmed struggling with the equipment and she slipped on the mat, falling on her butt. this was posted online and got passed around the gym and outside of it. she found out way later, and this hurt her. when she reported this to the gym, the manager said he would speak to the women. days later, she asked the manager if he spoke to them, and he asked who my sister was (basically he forgot).

my sister wrote a complaint to the higher ups at the gym. she received a response stating that there was nothing they could do about her being filmed, as it was a public space. three days after this, she received a notice stating her membership at the gym was cancelled. despite this, she was charged the renewal fee. i stepped in and called them, demanding a refund on my sister's behalf. the gym told me that it was her responsibility to cancel the membership herself, i told them that *they* were the ones who cancelled on her. basically the conversation went in circles.

now what can i do? i have a feeling that there's not much i can do legally but i am hoping something can be done. my sister does not want to go to the media because she feels embarrassed and is afraid of being in front of a camera, also of the video online gaining more visibility. can i take them to court? if so, for what charges? can i legally compel them to give my sister the refund?",2

"when sitting down while talking to someone, cross your legs. if you need to leave or want to get out of the conversation, uncross them and lean forward slightly. the person you're talking to will likely start to wrap up what they're saying.. this probably works because of the sudden loss of a casual demeanor. the person will see it as a signal that you're about to leave, and will likely end the conversation for you, usually within mere moments.

edit: i just woke up, and can't believe how much attention it got! i posted this because i used to find goodbyes awkward, but when i started doing this it much got easier. as others have mentioned, leaning forward might indicate interest in the conversation. what i meant to say is that you should stop leaning backward. i guess i phrased it poorly.

"for sticking up for an ex instead of my girlfriend?. throwaway. my girlfriend and i are in a huge/ potentially relationship ending argument. i need to know if ita. 

i'm in a very ldr with basically the girl of my dreams. absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. 

she came to town, and i was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. they threw a party, and while on the way, gf randomly asked ""are there any girls i should be worried about"" this is probably where i fucked up,  but i explained that a girl i used to see will likely be there. explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn't seen each other since well before i met gf. i was asked if we ever slept together. i said yes, because...we had. also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn't a big deal. 

everything started out great. everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. 

gf gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. she randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. i was honestly so surprised. so was everyone else. 

i apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said ""no worries. play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes"" (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. she was so devastated that i didn't tell her that was out of line; however, i feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. 

we got into the biggest argument about how i didn't have the decency to stand up for her. i told her honestly, i should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can't be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. 

she's now back on a plane, and we will ""discuss further"" once she clears her head.

am i the asshole?

edit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. 

edit 2: update: i've gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. i admitted that i'm an asshole for how i've gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. i adore her, but i'm not comfortable with the default response being ""i'm jealous, i'm going to be rude to someone i don't know"" 

she is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always ""choose"" the other girl. i tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that i can't do anything about that, but i do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. every one of them, and i definitely think she can recover. but she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it's probably not going to developed past this. 

for the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren't strictly platonic. yes, i understand her comment was towards me. plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess i should take a page out of his book.

"for wanting a divorce from husband who lost 200k on bitcoin?. &#x200b;

my husband and i have been married for 10 years. for our entire relationship, i have brought the majority of the money into the home. i contribute 75% of that. i don't mind, really. it's not something i think about and i have always considered it ""our"" money. our country (switzerland) is really expensive and i grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. when i had the chance to go to university, i studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. years later, i make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.

we decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. i would check on the accounts every once in a while but, i haven't been checking regularly. a few weeks ago, i was thinking about buying a model 3, since it has recently come to our country and i've fancied it for some time. i played with the numbers and while figuring out if i can afford it or not, i realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. there was 300k chf/usd missing.

when my husband got home, i showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. this is about 25% of our savings. besides being shocked and angry, i cannot help to feel that he stole from me. he put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. i was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. they think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. but i honestly just want to get divorced. if he is capable of doing this, how can i trust him ever again? for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? for thinking about divorce?

&#x200b;

edit: to clear a few things. we always talked about where the money should go. what things to invest in, etc. i always thought he was really open about it and i trusted him... because he is my husband. i work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as i do. after going to work every day, making more decisions about money when i came home wasn't something i wanted to do. that's why i wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. i don't think that was clear above. so we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.

edit: if he had doubled our money or ""won"" in some way, would i be feeling the same way? partially. i would be angry for him not talking about this with me. this is a large sum, too large not to discuss. i would be happy because i would have more money. who wouldn't be happy if they had more money in their home accounts? but i would have stepped in and taken control of everything because i see all of this as gambling and that's not what i would like to do with money.",3

"i told my girlfriend to kill herself and she did. remorse 

we had been dating for 3 years and she was like my best friend. my first impression was that she was this cute girl who was really fearless and her life was perfect and nothing bothered her. turns out she was and still is the most unstable person i've ever met in my life.

there was a point where she was constantly calling me crying about something that had upset her. like she found one roach in her new apartment, or because exams were killing her and she's stupid, or because her friends cancelled on her or her father isn't listening to her again. each and every time she called, i would drop everything i was doing and go help her. it got to a point where i was often sacrificing important matters, one time i even left a job interview for a really good company because she was having a body dysmorphia breakdown. 

her mental breakdowns eventually overshadowed all the good times and i found myself centering all my decisions and time on her. friends & family started saying this was toxic and she was dragging me down so i finally broke up with her in person and comforted her for an entire 5 hours after. just sitting there holding her while she cried. she had begged me to stay and promised she'd get better and that she needed me. that's what kills me every time...

after a few weeks of not talking (i tried contacting her just in case she needed help but she stopped answering my calls), she called me while i was in a class seminar and i got so mad for some reason because everyone could hear my phone ringing and my professor was giving me the murder eye. i got madder than usual, almost freaking lost it and ended up telling her to ""fuck off."" thats seriously what i said...and then she started crying and told me she was going to kill herself because she's hurting and me thinking about all the ""she's manipulative and toxic"" drift my family & friends were on, i just told her, ""well do it then."" and hung up and went back to class.

i don't know why i said those things. i was just really angry and annoyed but after a few hours, i was okay and tried calling her back to apologize but she didn't answer. then i found out from a friend that she killed herself the next day.

i think about it every single day and its literally eating me up inside. i quit college, i'm addicted to stuff that i probably shouldn't even say on here, and no one wants to be around me anymore. i feel like a fucking murderer sometimes all i needed to do wasbe there for her and maybe she wouldn't have done it. or at least not be an ass and tell her to do it. 

the funny thing is everyone thinks i did her some good and that it's so beautiful that the love of her life was the last one to talk to her. i keep thinking that maybe if i hadn't been the last one, maybe she'd still be alive.

i'm crying now.

my husband (27m) had a different dentist from the one i (26f) had been using since i was a kid. there was a period of time he didn't go to the dentist for a couple of years. so about 4 years ago he went back to the same dentist he used to use, and his mother has always used. 
that dentist in nj told my husband he had 13 cavities! so my husband listened and went back to start having them filled. he ""filled"" at least two then my husband stopped going again. 

fast forward to now, i went to see my dentist on tuesday and made appointment for my husband to go in today (thursday).  my dentist showed my husband his x-rays and told him his teeth are perfect! and that he actually had pre drill holes where this other dentist was going to fill fake cavities!! this is so wrong! my mil also had thousands of dollars of work done to her mouth that could also have been unnecessary. she is making an appointment with my dentist to get another opinion on her mouth. 

we are members of legal shield so i would assume we would work though them. but i am curious on what legal action we can take or what we would have to do to take care of this. i would for sure think this is medical malpractice and i would hope he loses his license for this abuse. we have never dealt with anything like this before so any advice or information on how this might play out would be greatly appreciated!",2
"got a tarantula so the in-laws stop coming by. i have insufferable in laws. father in law is manageable, but mother in law is crazy.

my wife is chinese and her parents are really traditional. privacy means nothing to them, and my wife refuses to set boundaries. they will come around every day unannounced to visit my wife/play with our kids. so not only do i never get a break from my mother in laws constant nagging, i have no privacy from them.

wife has ignored my concerns for years. to be fair, she's in a tough spot as standing up to chinese parents is a pain i guess.

anyway, mother in law is arachnophobic. a few months ago she went crazy after a (wolf?) spider was simply in the corner doing nothing. panic attack and all.

so i got the idea to get a tarantula as a way to prevent her coming so often. it's in a big enclosure in the living room. asked wife before hand if it's okay, but didn't tell her the motivation. worked like a charm, the dad still comes but the mother can't stand to be in the same house as it.

in my city have no elevators whatsoever, but they all have stairs, so i'm stuck inside unless carried out and that's not an option since it's pure agony on my back.

this wasn't the end of it though, because around the same time my mother has developed paranoid schizophrenia and became completely irresponsible, taking out large loans from all sorts of firms to get 4-star vacations. she went to malta, greece and paris (twice), accumulating a huge pile of debt. she's retired early, so she only gets a piddly little pension and she's a chain-smoker, smoking 3 packs a day which adds even more financial strain.

i only get a disability pension which isn't that much and my father is a cab driver who works for a patron. he works from 5 am to 8 pm and doesn't make a lot. none of this is enough for the massive pile of debt, we live practically check-to-check nowadays.

i want to do something, get a job, make some money and help in putting all of this behind us and moving out so i don't have to stay with my mother, who has completely ruined us. but i don't have any skills, i barely learned anything in the rare home schooled classes i took. and i think i might be suffering from depression, i can't bring any focus or motivation to bear. i try to do some programming or focus on studying systems administration and i can barely focus without my thoughts drifting or switching to doing something else (reddit, fanfiction, youtube). but the others things i do aren't any more compelling. even my favorite hobby (gaming) doesn't entertain me. i just feel... empty and so, so tired. i don't even remember what it feels like to be happy any more.

sorry if i've been rambling or incoherent, but this is the first time i've got all this out. not sure if posting all this was a good idea, or if this even is the right subreddit for it, but i don't really have anything left to lose. any ideas, guys?",10

when's the last time you heard of a widely available support network for men? higher suicide rates, higher incarceration rates, un-realistic expectations. innocent guys getting punished with heavy sentences for false rape claims. guys being told to 'man-up' when they dare complain about anything. prostate cancer rates higher than breast cancer, with a fraction of the non-for-profits that are specialized for it. 

it's tough out there. there are people out there that are doing great work for men, great advice and great support. i'm very thankful for these people and organisations.

and make no mistake, this isn't throwing blame, or taking away from other worthy causes. domestic violence is real and prevalent, rape is despicable and ever present.

"no regrets i haven't wiped my ass since 2014. throwaway because this is my weird little secret.

basically, in mid-2014 i had a bout of baaaad gastro and i spent about a week sitting on my toilet like some kind of porcelain throned royalty. between the extreme acidity of the terrible squits i was gushing out and the three-ply paper i was attacking its aftermath with, by the end of the first day my asscheeks were raw.

day two was unbearable agony, and after my third or fourth deposit to the bank of stank i couldn't bear it anymore and went straight from the toilet to shower and sprayed my tainted taint with water. it was pure, unbridled, bliss in comparison to wiping each time, which even with three-ply felt like i was using sandpaper at that point.

so i kept doing it. i lived alone, nobody could judge me, so i took a quick shower and gently rinsed my butthole every time my gastro came knocking. some four days later, it had turned into an ingrained habit. life moved on, my shits downgraded from a 7 back to a blissful 4 on the bristol stool chart and i abdicated the porcelain throne a changed man. 

i kept washing my ass in the shower every time i took a shit, and i have honestly never felt cleaner in my life. long gone are the dingleberries. banished is the swamp ass. when i've had my salad tossed since this change, i've had compliments about the general cleanliness of my nethers. it's my private smug little secret when i talk to people, knowing that regardless of whatever else they might have over me they are very unlikely to have a cleaner asshole than mine, nor do they know the ~~power of the brown side~~ comfort that is a post shit shower.

the year is 2018. it's been about 3 and a half years since i last used toilet paper, and if i need to take a shit i and i'm out i just bank it for later deposit and hold out till i get home - thankfully though i'm very regular.

for those who are going to ask, i live in australia, and bidets do exist here but they're very rare, but they're on my to  do list because let's face it, a pre-wash never hurt anyone.

hi everyone

it's been several days since my post, and i really just wanted to say thank you to everyone who gave me their opinions and offered condolences. i appreciate your time and thoughts so much. plus, reading through this thread was a great distraction and it helped me keep it together for my family when i was with with them... especially the snarky replies lol.

it has felt like a long week but i finally feel like i'm over the hurdle. yesterday was the funeral, where my family asked me to speak. my cousins couldn't. the funeral was packed, and the overflow room in the funeral home was filled with people who loved my uncle.

my sisters fiance and my brothers girlfriend both came to support our family. i think that was one thing that really drove home the conclusions i came to earlier in the week. 

through this whole week, my bf has not once asked how i feel or if i'm okay. my friends, coworkers, and acquaintances who knew my uncle have shown me more compassion.

i don't hate him, but he really took me down.

at first i was going to take the advice many people gave and just ghost him. it seemed like the easiest thing to do. i even deleted all of my events from our shared google calendar, and left group chats that we were both in. i blocked him on fb messenger but that only lasted like an hour before i realized that i'm not that person. even though i was hurt and angry, i don't need to get even. 

on thursday (the night before the visitation), i cracked and texted him asking him to just talk to me and explain what was happening, and then i went to sleep.

part of me didn't think he'd respond, but in the morning he had sent me a long message explaining his perspective. 

he basically explained he doesn't handle grief or loss well due to past experiences (i understand), but then accused me of being like his ex-girlfriend and he can't go back to that and how i have to communicate.

i know i'm not winning any awards for communication. i'm afraid to speak my mind sometimes and that leads me to be passive aggressive or with festering issues. but how can i communicate with someone who doesn't respond to me or ask questions? i don't think he realizes it's a two way street.

we had a previous conversation where i explained to him that it was hard for me to express myself because of past trauma, and that i would try to improve but i would need him to be patient and call me out and ask me questions. this is what frustrated me the most.

i responded with a long message saying that i understand i reacted badly, but then explained my side and told him that his actions were hurtful especially because i really needed him and he rejected me. i needed support and he ignored me instead for being too emotional.

he said sorry, and asked if we can make up. i told him i don't know and that i couldn't think about it with everything else going on, so we're supposed to talk later this week.

the thing is, even though i understand his reaction a little better, it's not something i can accept or live with. as a lot of you pointed out, our communication styles are just too incompatible. i was willing to work towards bridging it, maybe because i didn't know where my line was. i definitely found the line this week.

even his apology didn't show any concern for my well being. i know some of you pointed out it's a young relationship, but i think generic condolences are not a lot to ask for from a partner - especially as we knew each other as friends before. 

he took my pain this week and made it about himself, and then waited for me to make it better for him. if i hadn't messaged him thursday, i truly doubt i would have heard from him at all. that kind of selfishness is not something i want in a friend or a partner.

so, whenever i get around to it, we're going to have to have that conversation. i'm pretty anxious about it and still sad, but i'm not willing to keep trying. if i did, i'd feel like i was selling myself out. 

if you read this far, thank you. i wasn't going to post this update because i felt self absorbed talking about myself like this. but i had a few private messages this week asking about what happened, so this seemed easiest.",7
"when my mom first met my father, he lied about graduating from a top university. i just got into that university.. gonna keep this short and sweet. my mom met my father 25 years ago. one of the many lies who told her about his status and upbringing etc was that he graduated from an extremely top university (about the same prestige as harvard for a us equivalent). after several occasions of sleeping with expensive escorts in foreign countries, my mom divorced him and raised me and my three siblings on her own in a foreign country where she knew nobody. we went from living literally the lifestyles of multimillionaires to being dirt poor and struggling to get by for so long (though things have been going pretty well recently). 18 years later, my two older brothers and i are all on full scholarships to overseas universities studying medicine and law and i just got accepted into the university he told my mom he graduated from. he is on his fifth wife, declared bankruptcy twice and his son just got arrested for possession.

"for not letting my boyfriend's best friends use my airline discount after saying they could?. throwaway because all parties know my account name.

backstory: my boyfriend (alex\*) and i have been together for 4 years, i've become friends with his two best friends (james\* and noah\*) but we're not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. i work for an airline and one of the major perks is that i get discounts on flights that i can also use for family and friends. as i am in my first year with the company i only get a certain number of discount seats and i had 3 left for the year.

situation: alex asked me if i could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. i happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. he booked his time off work and they made their plans. they were to send me the money and then i would put it all on my card just for simplicity.

three nights ago alex came home really upset. he told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. he was upset because he couldn't move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. i was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. to make up for i started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.

james messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. no ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. i was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. i sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as i would be using the seats for me and alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. he replied with a barrage of texts saying that i was being selfish and unfair as i had ""promised"" two seats to him and noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. he even phoned alex to complain. alex is torn. he thinks it's a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn't want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so i should just give them the seats to keep the peace. i refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.

am i the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?

&#x200b;

update: thank you everyone for your support. i must admit i know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the nta votes but i hate going back on my word and i guess i did feel a bit like an asshole just because i've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so i needed some honest opinions. this sub has shown me the light and i will be showing alex this when i get home. he is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if i have to grow it in a lab. i'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. any holiday suggestions?

2nd update: thank you everyone for your votes and insights. it made me realise that even though most of you have voted me nta, there are some things i hadn't considered. i have spoken to alex and shown him this thread (guess i don't know why i used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. he apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn't stand up for himself and i apologised for not discussing my choice with him before i told his friends they can't use my discount in the way that i did. he said he's just going to let it play out but he'll be willing to forgive them eventually. so for those wanting a final dramatic update, i don't think we'll be getting one. 
for anyone asking or not believing the story because of this: i don't know the story of the concert, this is the story as i know it from my point of view. they're going to see skepta.",3
"countering the ""rent is just throwing away money"" meme.. hello wonderful pf community. this is in partial response to yesterday's top post entitled ""buying a house 'responsibly' impossible for many?"". while this was a great post, i'd like to point out that renting isn't half bad for what you get. a rent payment doesn't *just* cover the roof over your head. you also get:

- included appliances, such as stove, dishwasher, fridge, laundry units, etc. this could cost thousands of dollars out of your pocket when you own. to not only buy the equipment up front, but also repair them.

- lawn care. you either have to buy your own mower upfront and be out in the hot sun for two hours every saturday, or pay a lawn guy. 

-  amenities. if your rental has a pool, gym, etc. you might pay a slight premium in rent for all of these, but the value is still there. gym memberships are *costly* these days. pool ownership and maintenance is a *hassle* (any current owners know this is true). 

- above all else, flexibility to move at basically anytime, so long as you have the cash on hand to buy out of your lease. with a house you have to factor in: possibly being underwater if you don't have enough equity, the extreme length of the sales process (even in a good market it could take up to a year!), and in a worst case scenario not even being able to sell it. i'm sure everyone already saw the ""leave your current job every 5 years or so to get a significant raise"" post. what if the next great opportunity is across the country? ya never know.

all this is *not* to say that renting beats homeownership. certainly the huge advantage of having no mortgage payment at the end of your 30 years (or however long) is great. but you have to do it right to make it work. just hoping to change the minds of some ""rent averse"" people!

edit 1: also property taxes!

edit 2: it's been pointed out that if you rent a *house* rather than an apartment that some of these perks wouldn't be included. but you also get more square footage and more freedom (not having to worry about pet regulations, not having neighbors literally on top of you, etc.)",10
"when arguing, try restating the main point's of the other person's argument back to them and have them do the same with you. believe it or not, the vast majority of arguments are based on miscommunication.  

with arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.

1) not understand the other person's argument

2)  feeling that the other person does not understand your argument

3) convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument

4)  arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...

5) an unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument

...

next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  

something like, ""hold on, i want to make sure i understand what you are arguing. you are saying that xyz is broken and the only way to fix xyz is to get qrs to modify y so that it will fit better into z?""

now this has several benefits.  

--first and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.  this is huge because most arguments get so convoluted the people arguing don't even know what they are arguing about (and this goes double for emotional and relationship type arguments when the people have history together).  

--secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect

--thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually ""listen"" and ""hear"" what they are saying.

--fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.

you can also do the reverse.  pause the argument and ask ""can you tell me what my argument is?  can you explain the problem as i see it?

this forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    and again, it helps to actually help define the exact problem...",8
"i confiscated my son's weed and then smoked it. let me start by saying my son is a very good kid.  he's a high school senior who gets mostly a's, he works a part-time job, and he doesn't get into trouble. so when i found a bag of weed in his pants pocket one morning while preparing the laundry, it came as quite a surprise.  i had no clue he was getting high.

flash forward an hour.  i'm in my backyard, chatting to arlene my neighbor, about what i found.  arlene has four kids, all grown and out of the house, and she's my go-to for parenting advice.  i ask her what i should do. she says, ""let's smoke it!""

i couldn't believe i was doing it, but 20 minutes later we were in arlene's kitchen smoking weed out of a tobacco pipe.  i hadn't smoked pot since college. we got really, really high and we giggled for hours in her kitchen, making and eating all kinds of food and dancing to the radio.  it was so much fun!

when my son came home from work that evening i saw him go into the laundry room, where his pants were folded along with the rest of his clothes, and take the basket upstairs.  he never does that, so obviously he was looking for his weed.  a bit later i called him down for dinner and we had a normal meal and conversation.  i sensed some relief when the meal was done and he went back to his room.

i still haven't decided what to say to my son.  meantime, arlene has the rest of the weed and i will have no regrets...unless she smokes it without me!

"my 4 person airsoft team apparently traumatized a small child — but i'm not buying it.. i'm apart of an airsoft team. we participate in military simulation and similar events. 4 of us were practicing clearing rooms — at my own external tornado shelter, which is on the opposite side of the house as this neighbor.

"for not letting a family member i barely know drive my expensive car in an ""emergency""?. i was at my in law's house yesterday, alone with their god daughter (we'll call her ashley, she's 28), while my husband was out doing stuff with his parents to discuss important family matters. i was already feeling pretty stressed and anxious about how their conversation was going to go. i don't really have a great relationship with ashley, so i was just keeping to myself in one of the guest rooms on my laptop with a large glass of wine. about an hour later she comes in, panicked, asking if she can borrow my car. apparently, her high school aged sister got in a really bad fight with their extremely dysfunctional father and needed to be picked up.

my car is a new mercedes that cost me around 80 grand. i absolutely did not want her taking my car, especially somewhere that was almost an hour away. i asked her if their dad got physical with her sister in this fight and she said no. so, i told her i would rather her wait until my in laws got back and see if she could take their car. 

she starts yelling at me that they probably won't be back for a few hours and she needs to get her sister asap. i told her that unless she believes her sister's safety is at risk, i don't feel comfortable with her taking my car. she asked if i could drive her to get her and i told her i had too much wine to drive. she then proceeds to shit on me for being ""irresponsible"" for drinking and not anticipating i might have to drive, as well as ""selfish"" for not letting her take my car.

when they get back, she asks to take their car and makes a huge deal about how i wouldn't let her take mine. she goes on about how my ""fancy car is more important than a child in crisis"". i told them she said the girl wasn't in any danger and she tells me to fuck off before she gets in their car to leave. 

my in laws said she's just being an overprotective big sister and not to worry about it. when my husband was driving us home he told me i made the right call because ashley is a very reckless driver, and totalled a car a couple years ago after driving too fast. however, the next morning my in laws text me that ashley was incredibly upset and i should have just let her take my car.

"i used to bully a kid in high school. i sent him a sex tape of me and his ex girlfriend. he dropped out of school after that and went on to become a drug addict. i feel absolutely horrible about it and cant get over the feeling that i ruined his life.. i was a terrible kid in high school. i was sort of a stereotypical jock bully kind of guy. i specifically bullied this one kid jack, who i just... irrationally hated. i thought he was so unbelievably lame at the time, and me and my friends couldn't resist picking on him. even just thinking about it makes me cringe. he was sort of an emo/scene kid who would wear anime shirts, which made him a big target for us. 

&#x200b;

he dated a girl named jess, but apparently they broke up on really bad terms. he would write on myspace (this was a while ago) that he desperately missed her and wanted her back, and he was sorry. jess sort of became friends with our group afterwards, something i am sure jack hated. one day we got drunk together and jess was ranting about how much she disliked jack and that he was a sad pathetic person, and eventually we hooked up and our friends left. we were both sort of... idk how to describe it, in this evil, drunken mood. we decided to send a video of us having sex to jack. the worst part was that in retrospect, she actually had no real reason to hate jack, she just hated that he was 'pathetic' and 'needy'. she was a terrible person too i suppose. hanging out with us made her a bully. jack was never mean or cruel to her, she hated him because she thought he was too much of a loser. i mean what the fuck was wrong with us that we were like this??  


he responded to the video saying that he wants to speak with jess, and that was it. i told my friends what happened, they thought it was hilarious, and soon it was spread all over the school that i had sex with jess and sent the video to jack. i remember seeing jack in the hallway and i saw his face, and it literally pains me to think about it, but at the time i thought it was awesome. his face was puffy red, his chin wobbly, his eyes were red, it was clear he was crying before or maybe the sight of me made him want to cry again. we hysterically laughed at him, right to his face, and basically made fun of him by saying that we fucked his girl. 

&#x200b;

i cringe in pain at the memory of that. i literally wish jack just took out a fucking knife and jabbed us all in the throat. i cannot believe we ever thought that was an okay way to fucking treat someone. and 99% of it was just trying to make my friends laugh, trying to see just how cruel we could be to push things to extremes. i am not even sure if i can fully understand the mindset i was in, it was a sense of complete superiority and distaste for someone 'weak' like that. 

&#x200b;

jack would end up switching schools very soon after. well, first he dropped out of school, then he went to an alternative school i think? something like that. regardless, i found his facebook page maybe a year or so later. my stomach dropped. it was filled with statuses about his addiction to pills and his attempts at recovery. lots of stuff about the pain and anguish of his life and how much he struggles with mental health. its been a decade, and i still check his facebook page a lot... and its the same thing. hes now a heroin addict. he goes through bouts of recovery, then relapse, then recovery. i cannot help but feel fucking guilty. this happened right when he transferred schools. he mentioned it in his status that it happened when he left our school, that was when he got addicted to pills. he also mentioned he left his school because everyone hated him there. 

&#x200b;

i sent him a message saying how sorry i was, and that i cannot believe i ever acted the way i did, and that i apologize to the fullest for how we treated him. he left me on seen, which is understandable. 

&#x200b;

it sucks. it makes me feel terrible about this. i wish i could just... idk, do something to make up for it. and it makes me feel terrible, i went on to have a great life. i went to a good college, am married and have a 1 year old kid, i live in a nice area in a (relatively) nice house. i sometimes think i would feel better if it was the kind of trope where the bully has a hard life and the kid getting bullied ends up super successful and the bully ends up a drunken loser. but that isn't what happened.

"nuclear power is infinitely better than anything we currently have and people need to stop fear mongering. people think of chernobyl and automatically discredit nuclear energy because they dont want that to happen again, although nuclear energy is much safer than it was decades ago.

coal mining kills about 12,000 people annually and its much more environmentaly devastating than nuclear energy. the waste from nuclear energy is really bad but theres very little of it and we have ways to contain it.

the breakthroughs that nuclear power could unlock if it was adopted worldwide would be enormous, we could basically solve the worldwide power shortage overnight and have so much left over that we could advance other renewable energies 10 times faster.

in the very... very rare case that chernobyl happened again i believe that the benefits it would provide to the world would outweigh the catastrophe.",6
"life on a budget. i am in a great mood today and want to try to spread some confidence. i know life can be hard, and finances makes it a lot harder than it has to be. my wife, myself, and our 3 month old baby live on a single income with no assistance other than renting a house that is based on my income. i make about $33,000 a year with base salary, benefits, and commissions. yes, we may not be in the best situation, and we don't have the most or nicest things, but even with our low income it's still possible for us to live, and even save! we pay close to $300 extra on my car every month and expect to pay it off next summer 3 years short of maturity. most importantly though, we are happy.

i'm no expert, and nowhere near perfect but here are some tips i have for budgeting:

* actually do it every month, there is no way you can just copy and paste it from month to month
* keep it simple, we like to line item everything we have, instead of food $600 we have groceries $300, monthly restaurant $26, emergency fast food $30, farm produce $24, and so on. when you have a small line item you are more careful with what you have on paper
* keep an overflow, but not too much. we usually keep about $50 each month for that inevitable ""oh no, i forgot i need an oil change!"" once you get really good at planning you won't need it as much, but that peace of mind makes budgeting seem easy.
* trust your budget. once you get it down don't hold your payments until the last second, just mail that check!

if we can do it, anyone can do it! you just have to believe in yourself and stick to your plan. nail that budget down, eat at home as much as possible, be thrifty, and learn to say no to that new tv. you guys got this, together we can all win at this money thing!

edit: thank you for all of your kind words! a few people have asked for me to lay out the budget so here it is https://imgur.com/a/osmdh3e(https://imgur.com/a/osmdh3e) . this month is a pretty big month for commissions so we decided to have a bit of fun and buy a few things that we've been wanting for a few months. the non-recurring stuff is most of that, and we are going to go on our first date since the baby so we pumped the restaurant budget up a tiny bit. it's important to have a bit of fun from time to time!

edit 2: i use everydollar to budget. i used mint for a little while but i found everydollar to be easier to use. linking your bank account seems like a good idea, but in my experience having the delay hurt me a lot, so i ended up manually entering everything anyway.

edit 3: a few faqs. 

* how do you get internet for $4.99 a month? i work for an isp and reimbursed for the majority of it. the mobile phone is also mostly paid for by my employer which is why it's so cheap for 2 lines. both of these were factored into my benefits.
* how is your rent and utilities so cheap? i live in tennessee which i think is one of the cheapest places to live in america. the duplex we live in is normally $564 a month, but it is based on income so we pay $444. electricity is the only thing we have to pay for in it because there is no gas, and each duplex shares a water meter, so they can't split it between the 2 units. the place isn't very nice i'm not going to lie, but until i can get my income up we're going to stay here and save as much as we can.
* why dota 2? because it's fun, and i like the tracking that comes with dota plus subscription.
* how do you eat so cheap? my wife is extraordinarily good at shopping for deals, aldi is great if you live near one! we eat different stuff every week because she only buys stuff that is on sale. we eat well and healthy too, tonight we had pork chops and brussels sprouts. also small stuff like buying whole chickens and cutting them yourself saves quite a bit of money. we spend about $20 for 4 chickens, which is about 6 meals worth of meat.

"employer offering to pay my student loan instead of contributing to my 401k. yesterday my employer let us know that they will be offering a new program in january. instead of matching up to 6% of our salaries in 401k contributions, we will have the option to put that money toward student loans. i currently have about 33k left and with regular monthly payments of $470, they will be paid off in roughly 6.5 years. i can currently add about $500 to the monthly payment, and at that rate, they will be paid off in ~2.5 years. using my employer's new program, i could have them paid off in ~18 months.  

my 401k will be at about 12k by the end of the year. i make 50k, so the annual contribution between my self and my employer is 6k. that 6k over 40 years will be worth ~60k at least. short-term, it would be nice to pay off my loans a year earlier, but long-term, my 401k loses a pretty big chunk of money. is this a good assessment?

"if i report my son's school?. okay, so at my son's school they have a system where kids get points for good behavior and negative marks for behavior that needs work. there is an app where parents can view this as well as communicate with teachers. 

my son's grade (1st) was having an end of the year good behavior field trip to a skating rink. the kids that could go had to have so many good behavior points. my son was diagnosed with adhd and we are working on ways to help him control his energy and to behave better. that said, he was about 5 points shy of being able to go on the field trip. because of that i did not send in a signed permission slip or money. 

the day of the field trip comes around and k send my son to school expecting him to have to go to another class room for the day. after school i pick him up and ask how his day was and he proceeds to tell me that they took him with them on the field trip. he said he was told to sit at a table on the side of the skating rink and to do a work packet while watching the other kids. 

he was upset because he was made to sit and watch everyone else having fun. that is understandable because these kids are 7 years old. yes he understands consequences for bad behavior but what adult thinks this is a good consequence? so since it was after school, i messaged his teacher asking about it. i have not gotten a reply. i tried calling the principal and was unable to reach her.

as per usual this didn't happen today but this past saturday. i (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. one of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. so we hop out and me, being the genius that i am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. i go to take a running leap in and as i'm pushing off the deck, i feel my foot slip. i end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. i come to as i'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause i need to breath, but they don't respond. most of my friends see me and think i'm joking, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. they stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. in another incredible bout of luck, once i'm stabilized on the deck i can move my legs again. friends call an ambulance (to which i am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks us healthcare prices) and once i get to the hospital i'm placed in the trauma icu and ct scanned. i then find out i've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. and now i get bed rest and at least 3 months in a c collar. so yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks!

"for telling the guy my fiance left me for how our relationship ended?. this happened a couple years ago but some of our mutual friends still think i was the dick in this situation, so i thought i would submit myself to judgement.

i was living with and discussing marriage with a girl i'd been dating for around 3 years.  she went off on a school trip around the end of february/beginning of march  and when she came back,  things seemed off.  it was just little things, like she started texting ""luv ya"" instead of ""love you"" and stuff like that.  i finally asked her what the deal was around the end of april, and we ended up ""taking a break"". i moved out, but we still hung out almost every day, still went on dates, still had sex. 

i had bought her a new cell phone around the time she got back, an lg v10 (believe it or not this is important). around the end of may or so, the phone malfunctions and bootloops endlessly, as they are known to do.  she gives it to me so i can try to warranty it or something to get some of my money back, while she buys herself a new phone.  i did some research and discovered that the bootloop could be temporarily bypassed by freezing the phone, so i decide to give it a shot so i can try to pull her pictures and stuff off and generally just try to win some good guy points.  it works, and as soon as i boot it up she starts getting messages from ""david"". lots of messages, of the not so innocent variety. 

i pop open the messages to see that they go back all the way to her school trip. she's been seeing this guy in secret for months, both before and after our ""break"" while also giving me the runaround and acting like we're on the verge of getting back together.  it's also clear that he doesn't know about me at all, every time he tries to make plans with her while we were doing somrthing, she was just making excuses like ""spending time with family"". 

i shoot him a few texts, tell him who i am,  that i just discovered i was being lied to, and that i suspected he was being lied to as well.  turns out he was recently divorced because his wife had been cheating, and he was horrified to discover that he had been the ""other guy"".  long story short, we both washed our hands of her and went our separate ways, but literally every female i know has told me that it was not my place to tell him and that i should have left well enough alone.  i even had to leave my job because the women there ostracized me so heavily because of it.  the way i see it, he deserved the truth and i helped him dodge a major bullet before it could hurt him like it hurt me.  clearly she was the asshole for cheating, but am i the asshole for exposing it?

edit to answer some common questions:

>why did you tell everybody?

i didn't.  i told one person at work, because i thought they were my friend, and who doesn't need a friend to talk to when shit like that goes down?  that one person told everyone else in the office.  we also lived in a really small town at the time, and gossipers gonna gossip.

>why are you calling her your fiancee when it sounds like you never proposed?

when i said we discussed marriage, i meant that we had sat down and decided that we were getting marries. plans were already in the works and a date had already been set.  i've always believed that a step that big should come from mutual agreement rather than springing it on someone and putting them on the spot for an answer. maybe i'm wrong.

>what did you do to make her cheat on you?

well, to paraphrase her reasoning, we had been together for a while and the relationship wasn't ""new and exciting"" anymore. she met a dude that made her feel the new and exciting feelings again so she decided to fuck him. also, fuck you for asking that.",3
"update: (not sure if i should break up) it's over. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/afjkus/not_sure_if_i_should_break_up/

i met with jake a day later.  i wanted extra time to think.  he initially acted really lovey dovey when we met up and told me that timmy was making me a giant ""welcome home"" sign for when i came back.  i said we needed to talk first.

i basically had written down an estimated numbers of hours i was providing active care for timmy in the past few months, versus him.  then how many hours of care he was predicting we each provide, which was 4 of his hours compared to 50 of mine.  i said that i hadn't had time to persue hobbies, go to the gym, etc in the last few months.  and also that we hadn't done anything as a couple.  i said for me to come back, he had to change all that.

he answered with his own list of stuff.  which was confusing, like his mom wants me to raise timmy's grades more as he struggles with reading, and he thinks that we should enroll him in a club.  i was upset because it was all stuff i'd have to do additionally to my workload.  i said i wouldn't, he said i'd come around.

then he said that i had put him in a bind for childcare the last two days, and asked if i would come and watch timmy for him anyway.  i said i would help for a few days if we have a sit down and he tell timmy that i'm not untrustworthy, as he had told the boy earlier.  he refused, saying that i proved i was untrustworthy by threatening to break up.  then he asked if i would at least chaperone him to a birthday party that's coming up at a bounce-trampoline place.  i said absolutely not, that i was undermined authority and that was awful in a place that dangerous.

he left.

my friends went with me to get my stuff yesterday.  i've been a mess, but friends are convincing me to go out with them a few places next week and i might take up dance classes again starting february.

thank you all for showing me i wasn't completely offbase

"update my neighbor falsely believes my disabled bil was being creepy, and i want to protect him.. previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9hm58g/my_neighbor_falsely_believes_my_disabled_bil_was/

hi, all. sorry for never replying to everybody's really kind, helpful advice -- i'm bad at reddit and really busy right now. i really do appreciate it.

for a few days after my initial post, my husband or i would walk my bil to his usual spot after work and watch from a distance to make sure he wasn't behaving inappropriately (he might have by accident). neither of us saw him do anything out of the ordinary; he just sat on the bench, took pictures, and looked around at the trees and flowers. he didn't watch or interact with anybody else, which is about what we expected. he's so, so shy.

per a lot of advice, i didn't delete any of my bil's photos for awhile. this pretty quickly got to be unmanageable though, because he takes 50-100 pictures every day, often just the same thing again and again. but we set up a google drive to save them all. 

my husband and i also talked to bil a lot about what to do/say if he is approached by police. he is not very verbal and very quickly gets flustered and upset in unfamiliar social situations, so we really practiced pulling out his medical alert card and being very ""non-threatening"" with his body language (my bil is 6'5"" but has physical mannerisms a little bit like a child's, so if you don't know him or why he's behaving the way he is, he can be pretty alarming). to be honest, i'm still nervous about it, but we practiced and talked about it a lot.

as for my neighbor, i saw her again a few times and she ignored me. i considered bringing my bil to meet her properly, but decided i didn't want to expose him to her freaking out. about a week ago, she approached me and told me she appreciated my ""taking control of the situation,"" but that my bil's disability was ""no excuse."" i said ""no excuse for what?"" and she said ""for filming and photographing children."" i considered pointing out that it isn't illegal to do that (as you guys did), but that would sound like he is doing it, so i just told her that she isn't doing that. she threatened to call the cops again but so far nothing's come of it. i'm keeping an eye out. in any case, it's getting colder, and my bil is spending less time just hanging out. he's also really happy to come with me to doctor's appointments, and i'm currently pregnant, so we've had a lot of those. (my neighbor started saying something about how i'd understand if i was a mother. i'm not showing yet, but i really considered telling her i was pregnant just to shut her up. but that's needlessly combative, lol.)

thanks again to everyone's kind advice. husband and i are currently working with bil on responses he should give if that neighbor/anybody else approaches him while he's nature-photographing.

"if fevers are the immune system's response to viral/bacterial infection, why do with try to reduce them? is there a benefit to letting a fever run its course vs medicinal treatment?. it's my understanding that a fever is an autoimmune response to the common cold, flu, etc. by raising the body's internal temperature, it makes it considerably more difficult for the infection to reproduce, and allows the immune system to fight off the disease more efficiently.

"i 31m found text messages from my gf 26f of 3 years to another man including ""i love you"". should i kick her out?. so this happened a week or two before christmas. we work opposite schedules so one of us can be at home with our kid at all times. she works weekends (and the occasional week night) at a local children's hospital and i work 9-5 weekdays. 

i had recently grown suspicious of her ""friendship"" with this guy she would bring over for play dates because he also has a young daughter. they were texting a lot and making plans to hang out together more and more frequently. 

one monday night when she had to work i decided to snoop. i logged into her imessages on the kids ipad and immediately saw that they were regularly texting. she was not texting me at the time but she was texting him, and very flirtatiously. kissy faces. heart emojis. all that. stuff she used to do with me! i kept my cool and kept watching to see how far this actually went. at first i was in shock and couldn't believe that was actually happening.

by the end of the night i saw it. they exchanged ""i love yous"" and they spoke of each other as their ""missing puzzle piece"" while making future plans to hang out together, alone. i still have all the text screenshots saved.

the next morning i brought it up to her and in my anger told her to move out. she claims that she didn't mean it and she was going to ""break it off"" with him after christmas but i find that hard to believe. she also claims they didn't sleep together but they had hung out together multiple times before without me so who knows. she even bought tickets for them to go to a hockey game together! plus i don't know what she's doing at home when i'm at work all week. 

part of me wants to believe her and let it go because we have a kid together and it was supposedly just ""meaningless words"" but shouldn't she have thought about before she decided to have an emotional affair with another man? she hid it from me so she obviously knew what she was doing was wrong.

the house and bills are in my name because we are not married so she has no legal right to stay here as far as i know (i have consulted with a lawyer already).

"i'm indian. apu is not even a little bit offensive. on the contrary, he's one of the best poc representations for its era.. the simpsons debuted in 1989, when the population was way more white, and the only really existent minority was black (and maybe hispanic).  indians basically didn't exist in the us.  

typically when making roles based on uninfluential minorities, it's considered okay to make them very negative.  this is why asian characters were shitty roles, while black characters weren't; blacks made up 12% of the population, while asians were not even 1%.  white characters were never made fun of for their whiteness, because whites were 80%+ of the populace.  

taking this into context, it's actually commendable how great of a character apu was written to be.  

now the bad part:  his accent was *absolute white trash levels of horrible*, and makes me cringe listening to it.  i definitely agree that he should have been voiced by someone who could actually do a fucking indian accent.  but again, given the time this was created in, even this isn't that big of an issue.  

i don't care who the voice actor is, because voice actors routinely voice all sorts of different races.  i've seen lots of black voice actors voicing whites, it's not a big deal.  i'd only care that they could actually get the accent to be sort of accurate.  that would *probably* necessitate the actor being indian though.  

for comparison, let's look at raj, from the big bang theory, which aired in 2007.  bbt pushes all sorts of stereotypes that don't even fucking make sense to me, like effeminacy and obliviousness, and these are *bad* stereotypes to boot.  and that's something that was created just 10 years ago.  not to mention that bbt is a completely shit show aside from all of that.  

my final take:  people crying about apu are crybabies who don't know how to think for themselves, and i don't think it's a coincidence that most of the indian people i know aren't even fazed by him.  i will agree that his accent was trash and grossly inaccurate, and his voice actor should have been replaced a long time ago.  apart from that, the character himself was totally fine.

so i'm sitting in this hospital bed just waiting for the labor to progress. the reason i'm writing here, even though it's unfortunate i have to think about this at this time, is because i'm currently in a different state (united states citizen) from where i live/am employed- so i'm pretty sure my insurance isn't going to cover jack for this whole ordeal. i'm worried about just how much this bill will be. i've already told the doctor that if it is safe to do so i would like to leave asap (after the baby is delivered of course) to prevent further charges. i'm still considering not getting an epidural to save that cost as well, although mentally i'd much rather not feel any more pain with this nightmare. 


i won't know just how much i'm facing for a while, but i'm sure its safe to assume we're looking at a lot, possibly 10k+? that's just a guess though. i wouldn't be shocked if it was well more, considering what us hospitals charge for everything. 


i also have never planned a funeral. ...we were thinking cremation, and i'm sure the funeral home can give us a quote when the time comes. no seperate ceremony or anything. i hope it isn't too steep. 


so, i guess i'm just wondering if anyone has any helpful advice with regards to saving a bit of money on these types of things and/or the best way to manage what will surely be quite the financial burden most effectively? me and my husband are both employed, and i will definitely try to pick up as many shifts as possible extra (rn). my husband is a bit more limited since he's a professor/musician and where we live isn't the most happenin' place for him to pick up some decent gigs for extra cash. we have a mortgage and 3 kids at home so obviously those things are still a factor. 


i'm just so lost... i guess i'm just hoping for some sort of guidance with this type of thing. anything. i never thought i'd be in this position...and everything feels so crazy. i guess this is the only thing i might find answers for in this whole mess, and i sure would appreciate any advice. thanks in advance for your time.

** so while i was in labor, it obviously became much more painful and i just could not keep up with my replies. i was reading though, and i want everyone to know that i did read every single reply and i went back to the post to catch any replies that do not show up in my inbox. i will respond here. i'm not sure i can reply to everyone individually, as so many of you reached out- and i can't express enough thanks for that. 
- many of you also have unfortunately had similar experiences and i'm so, so sorry for your loss. and thank you for allowing your experience to help another. 

**i did end up getting the epidural for thos who were concerned. i am still in the hospital, and the doctor will probably see me later this morning (i couldn't sleep much, it's 3:45am currently). 

**i put someone in charge of calling funeral homes, as so many of you had great suggestions with that and finding a place that could offer an at cost (and some places, free or close to it). unfortunately/apparently in this area only 2 places even accept stillborn babies, and 1 was about 2k before the urn and they told us you have to buy at least some certain  type of urn. many of you have said that is not true, but this person did not argue with them, she just gathered the info. the other isn't much better, but apparently i don't have much choice either. i will call them tomorrow as i can manage a more stern demeanor when inquiring about specific things/dealing with ruthless upselling. 

**a kind redditor (and another looked up some more generalized info) who works in insurance actually extended a helping hand and is offering me some more personalized (without personal info) guidance, which is so nice and will hopefully lend some answers while we get to figuring out the nitty gritty of it all. 

**i've had a few troll messages, and if you are one please know that i'm an adult who knows when and how to ignore- luckily it doesn't get to me but i do hope you reconsider your actions when messaging others as they may not be as stable/prepared for such a thing, especially when dealing with profound tragedy. 

*i'm quite tired atm, so i will update again later. thank you all for your help, suggestions, condolences, etc. much love to you all. ",10

"spend $1500+/month on groceries and eating out, please help!. for as long as i can remember, my family has eaten out 75% of meals.  my mother is the only mother i've ever known who is a certifiably terrible cook (my dad refuses to eat any fruits or vegetables or anything with spices other than s+p, so that doesn't help).  throughout college, i worked full time while going to school full time and spent most of my money pursuing the same habits, getting wendy's or taco bell 4-5 times a week.  i've never really learned to cook and when i think about it psychologically i realize i definitely turn to fast food as a comfort and really enjoy the feeling of ""being out"" at a restaurant or something.   i'm really unhappy if i manage to not eat out for a week or so and feel miserable.

now i'm older, 30, and i make around $200k a year.  but my habits have still not matured.  it's not fast food, but i still go to fast casual restaurants and fancy places 7-10 times a week, often paying for my gf. i checked my mint.com records recently and found i was spending upwards of $1500/month on this, which i realize is ridiculous.   i need to change and just feel a little overwhelmed with how to do so.  is this a case for therapy or is there something simpler i can do in the meantime?   

edit: whoa, this blew up. thanks everyone for the great advice.  i was an inaugural member of blue apron years ago and was frustrated with their selection a lot of the time. too much cod. yuck. anyway a lot of it went to waste anyway as i'd just ignore my blue apron food to eat out anyway. anyway i got rid of that a few years ago. i think the suggestions to do things gradually and without the use of a food service are good and i'm gonna try those. 

i agree with those of you who suggested it is not hard to cook. i should have been clearer in the op - i can cook fine, i just don't ever desire to cook at home. i genuinely prefer fast food and fine dining (curiously i sometimes prefer fast food). just thought i'd try and get some ideas from folks i respect (this forum) on how to change that.   i can probably ""afford"" it but i just don't want to. i would prefer to spend what an average person does and just save the rest.

edit 2:  since everyone was asking, i work in a big law firm. also i thought i'd give an update - i made a bunch of breakfast burritos to eat over the next two weeks instead of my usual latte and muffin out, and cooked enough chili for leftovers for the rest of the week. one day at a time.",10
"for pressing charges on my daughter for fraud?. me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though i consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. for some basic context, she took out a parent plus loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. in her first semester of her freshman year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. we explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. after me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. we brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

come us, a couple years down the road. we've gotten a letter from the department of education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. we reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. she filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct social security numbers and all. we've spoken with the school and the doe a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. we can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in medical debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. at this point, i'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. we don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. so, here's the important question, reddit: if i press charges here, aita?

edit: since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. a plus loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the repayment process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


edit 2: i promised myself i would never do anything stupid like this if i ever had a post blow up, but now i truly understand what rip inbox means. i really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; i know reddit is one of the few places i can make a post and expect to get a reply.  


in reality, even though i've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying i wnbta (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, i'm still 100% split about how i actually want to go. you guys have given me a lot to chew on, and i'd really like to thank you all.",3

my gf got pissed and said i was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive and you can easily get them at a cvs. i am all about vaccinations, but i am not a fan of being told i need to do something for someone else's peace of mind.

"encouragement it sucks but paying down debt is a good way to avoid spending money on stupid stuff.. the short is that my wife and i were making over $120k. i drove a stupid expensive truck and she needed to quit her job.

cut to late last year where i ditched my truck for an electric vehicle saving a combined $500+/ month gas and payments. she quite her job and got $5k in back pay, the ev tax credit yielded me a $6.5 tax return and my work bonus was $3k.

we also heavily reorganized our finances, changed insurance providers,  and got our spending under major control. we were never at risk when she was working, but we ate out too much and spent too much money on junk.

we took this ""windfall"" $14k and sat on it as it came in across jan/feb/mar. i watched our savings grow past our emergency fund limit and everytime i had the urge to go out and upgrade my vehicle again i would pay off a student loan. i just made another payment and feel proud that i am working to dig out of the hole instead of digging deeper in.

anyone struggling out there, when you get money don't do what you want to, do what you need to. i am confident that buying that vehicle wouldn't have truly negatively affected me, but the loan is something i won't be living with and that will be unequivocally the better life option.

thanks for reading as i still fight the emotional feeling if wanting my expensive luxury truck i can no longer afford a down payment on.",10
"how my emergency fund made a horrible week a little more bearable.. they say you should start every story with a hook. here's my hook: a friend of mine came to my house about three weeks ago and confessed that she was seriously considering killing herself.

after many hours and tears i managed to convince my friend to go to the er and sat with her all night there. she confessed to the crisis worker that her husband has been abusing her and that she was planning on overdosing that night. when her husband found out she was in the er, he threatened to divorce her to make her leave. mercifully, the hospital ""blue sheeted"" her, meaning she was held by law and admitted to the psych ward. 

 i'm a very recent graduate on the job prowl and living under a very tight budget (i've been using ynab and it's spectacular!). despite the narrowness of my finances and largely due to this lovely subreddit i've been striving very hard over the last year to build a little emergency fund. this emergency fund was the absolute tits during this trying time.

i told my friend i had the means to pay the hospital copay if she couldn't. during that night in the er while she peed in a cup i bought myself some tea and snacks. early in the morning i went shopping for a pair of drawstring-free sweatpants for her because she was sad and afraid and cold and hospital gowns suck balls. i also found her a book to keep her occupied, since psych ward patients are not allowed any form of media. when i was allowed to visit her at the hospital i bought myself a big old cafeteria meal with all the available comfort foods. when she got transferred to a hospital farther away i filled up my gas tank. when i had to cover her shift at work, after not sleeping for two days, i bought all the coffee. all of it. i didn't have the energy to cook so i ate out. when all the stress, sleep loss, and hospital time gave me a goddamn cold, i bought some medicine. after about three days in hell i finally got a chance to sleep. i rested so easily knowing my friend was safe and my finances were secure. all of the money i spent during that time was just sitting there waiting for something like this to happen.

she spent nearly a week in the ward and was put on medications. she says now she's happier than she's ever been. she's not out of the abusive relationship yet (that's going to be a whole other beast) but it sounds like she's gaining the tools she needs to take care of herself.

shit happens, mental health is serious, and emergency funds are super rad. if you don't have one, start one.

thanks for convincing me that the pain-in-the-ass process of saving for unforseeable events when you're poor is totally worth it.

"my (25f) best friend (25f) slept with an old crush at her bachelorette party and acts like nothing happened. i'm torn between doing ""the right thing"" which would likely ruin a 20 year friendship or closing my eyes and looking the other way. hear me out. 

let's call her jane. jane and i have been friends and neighbors since we were 5. we went to college together and had a typical ""wild streak"" during those years, filled with lots of debauchery. we never did any drugs, though. that was our hard line in the sand. after graduating, we both got well paying jobs and essentially got our lives together. i am not married and still happily single, but jane is engaged to be married to a great guy, let's call him robert. our families love him and over time, he also became my good friend. they're getting married in a beautiful destination wedding in september. i couldn't be more excited for them and jane has been planning this event for close to a year. 

this weekend we had her bachelorette party which consisted of going to our country club with 8 other girl friends. the plan was to just swim, tan, bbq, play volleyball, watch movies, drink cocktails, and reminisce. on saturday morning, jane comes to breakfast and tells us that she has a surprise for us. okay, shouldn't be the other way around? lol. anyway, around noon, 6 dudes in swimming attire roll in. we were like, ""um, isn't this supposed to be a girls weekend?"" to which jane replied, ""yeah but i figured you girls need some company"". we all laughed, however none of us ever even hinted at needing men. turns out, this was just her cover and ruse to get guys in without making it obvious it was for her. we spent the day by the pool, playing volleyball and drinking. now, most of the girls there were single so we got a little touchy feely with the guys. to our surprise, at some point towards the evening, i see jane making out with a dude in the pool. i just brushed it off and went about my business. another friend karen walked up to me asking why is name of guy here. initially i didn't know who she was referring to but then it clicked. i knew that dude looked familiar but couldn't put my finger on where from. turns out, he was jane's huge crush in college. classic football star, philanderer, handsome and charming guy. we both realized that the whole reason why she had invited these guys over was that she could casually spend time with her old crush. 

at that point i figured the party was taking a turn we weren't comfortable with so i walked up to jane, pulled her to the side and essentially reminded her that she's getting married next month. she laughed me off, asking me to not ruin her party. i wasn't about to argue with her so i dropped it. they made out the whole night, in front of everyone else. jane was sitting on his lap, kissing, petting, doing all sorts of inappropriate things. another girl even tried to say that our party days should be behind us, we're grown ups now, not teenagers fucking in bushes. nope, nothing could swing jane. around 2am, everyone went to the rooms. as expected, jane and that guy spent the night in the same bedroom and i assume they were not playing board games. this morning, we all had breakfast, then the guys left, we checked out, and came back home. i talked to jane earlier and she is back into the full wedding prep mode, talking about flowers and menus. 

me and the girls discussed about whether we should have a serious talk with jane. we've all seen other friends of ours getting married to the wrong people, being miserable, and getting divorced before they hit their 30s. i don't want this to happen to her. we're pretty much 50/50 on whether we should just forget what happened and never mention it again or have the talk with her. we all saw that she and that guy had some weird chemistry and seemed very comfortable with each other. i'm not sure if that was their first time together since college. i'm thinking that she might still have a thing for that dude but i am not sure how to bring it up with her without sounding harsh. what do we do?

i don't normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and i needed to reset it. when i go into her room, i found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. i look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. i go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously i am enraged, so i wait for her to get back from school, and i called the police. she was arrested, booked and released into her mother's custody.

her mother is pissed, and saying that i may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. she now has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn't take the rules in my house seriously. i doubt she'll get more than probation anyway.

"finally stood up to abusive husband. throwaway account as my sister in law lives on reddit. me 30f finally got a back bone and stood up to my 32m husband. long story so bare with me please.

we've been together for 6 years, married for 2. everything was fine for the first 3 years. we met at work where i was an an intern, he was a manager. he was so sweet and really supportive of my ambitions and goals as i was of his and we clicked right away. we began dating and as time went on, i started climbing the ladder at my job and on our third year together, i was offered a managing director position....that's when everything went south.

when i was offered the position. i was over the moon, having been an intern on close to nothing , climbing my way up to a position where i'd earn more than enough money to look after both him and i and our future meant so much to me. when i told him, i thought he would be ecstatic especially as he has proposed to me a month prior and i had said yes, it was a great way to earn more money for the wedding and a house.

his responses was lacklustre and he said oh okay, i'll have to think about how i feel about this, turned around and walked out the door and left me for over a week. wouldn't respond to my messages or calls. i was beyond sick and worried, i thought something had happened to him. he finally came back, over a week later (hadn't shown up at work either) strolls in like nothing happened and says, if you take this job, i'm leaving you. i was shocked and tried to talk about it about it but he said his feelings were final.

like an idiot, i declined the job because i didn't want to lose him. he once again become sweet again and even though i wasn't earning as much, we were still together. a few months down the track and he starts being critical of my appearance and mental state. he says i've put on weight and should be focused on doing more around the house and working out and he isn't happy with our ""average"" sex life. this throws me for a 6 but i oblige and start working 9-5, getting up at 6 to go to the gym to lose the 10 pounds i had put on off , cleaning the house before i went to work, coming home and cooking every night and then trying to get more adventurous and sexy for him to spice things up.

i'm exhausted by this, meanwhile he goes to work 4 days a week, does no cleaning, plays video games and criticises every meal i cook. i really start losing self esteem at this point and start feeling depressed. he takes it upon himself to talk to my boss behind my back and then i end up having a meeting where my boss says, i think you're putting too much stress on yourself and we'd like you to take some time off. i was stressed and exhausted but work was the only place where i could escape. even though it felt like shit, i decided to take some time off. while i was having time off my husband manipulated my work and kept telling me that i'm not of sound mind, that i'm hopeless, that i'm a wreck and should quit my job. i told him no but he barraged me 24/7 and told me that there'd be no wedding.....we had already paid for 75% of it and some of that was a gift from my parents, i was scared of letting them down so in the end i relented.


well we got married, i thought i could be happy but i was the shell of a woman i once was. jobless, in a constant state of fear of what else he'd say was wrong with me. he took my phone, limited my internet time, isolated me and made me believe i could only depend on him and that i wasn't worth anything.

the last year has been hell, all i've wanted to do is sleep my life away, although i would t dare in fear of his retaliation, instead i spent my day cleaning and cooking, doing everything he wanted and yet he'd tell me i was ugly and stupid and would just demand sex because the least i could do was get him off.

i felt like a used puppet purely there to satisfy him and not be a full person. fast forward to a few weeks ago, i found out i was pregnant, what should've been the happiest moment of my life, scared me to death. some of you may judge me for this but it shook me to the core. i thought about this for a few days , didn't tell him but decided to secretly abort. i was devastated, i want to be a mom but i couldn't imagine subjecting a child to this life. i was numb for a while, i just continued on with everything until a few days ago. 

it hit me like a train, he was so abusive in such a manipulative way. i had given up so much of me to make him happy, i had aborted a child because deep down inside, i knew he is a piece of shit.

i found my car keys that he had hidden and my phone. i found a divorce lawyer, called up my old boss, i went to work, i marched in and said to my boss that i'd like my job back. he asked how my husband would feel about it and i said, i don't care, i know i'm good at what i do and i need the money to leave him. my boss clapped his hands and said welcome back and that the whole team would support me coming back into the work force.

my husband obviously had gotten home by this point and noticed my phone and car was missing, started blowing it up, sending me disgusting messages and telling me to get home now. 

i went home. i walked in, he started yelling and telling me that i've abused his trust by stealing ""my property"" without running it by him, that i should be ashamed. i told him that he can get fucked, we're over, i'm leaving him and he'll be hearing from my lawyer. he immediately started crying hysterically and begged me to stay, that we should work things out , i told him that all of these years i thought it was me who was lacking, but thanked him because it was because of that lie that he kept telling me that made me realise, i'm not lacking, i'm an educated, smart, intelligent person, i said but you knew that already, instead of celebrating me, you became insecure and tried to diminish who i was to make yourself feel better. i told him he was right to feel that way, i am better than him and that you can't polish a fucking turd and walked out, blocked him on all social media, notified all of our friends and family and i've never felt better. 

my question is, should i get someone to collect my things from our house or should i just leave them to avoid having to deal with him?


i'm really looking forward to 2019!

"the reason it's looked down upon for a woman to sleep with multiple men rather than vice versa is because it actually takes skill for a man to get with a woman.. now i want to start this by saying i don't give a shit who fucks who how many times, but it's obvious why men are slapped up and high-fived when they bring home a one night stand vs a woman being called a whore when she has multiple partners.

women are picky af. men aren't. it's in our genetics.

for a man to bring home a woman, even a promiscuous one, you need some game. you gotta have -

1. good physical presentation, usually how you're dressed + how you actually look
2. you usually have to spend some amount of money.
3. you need to be able to produce good conversation that separates you from other men.
4. you usually need to be a couple levels above that woman (woman is a 6, guy is an 8)
5. a woman will probably ask for your occupation or field of study. a man will not care if you're a vomit collector (yes this is a job).

if a woman truly wants, she can just walk into a bar on friday night, spend about 5 minutes scoping out the room, go up to a dude she likes, speak to him for another 10 minutes, and take him home while both are completely sober.

a man doing this? no way. it's like an epic quest that you invest most of your night into. and if you did a *very good* job, with the help of some alcohol (not wasted but slight buzz), you *may* get lucky.

there have been dating app experiments where they take a 10/10 man vs a 10/10 woman, and at the end the man who is a complete adonis has 200/1000 matches, and the woman has 800+.

"by telling my coworkers i like kiddie porn.. this happened a few hours ago but i need to back up to last night to give a proper explanation.   

i've started watching chernobyl on hbo since got is over. i'm digging it so far and watched episode 3 last night. there's a scene where a group of 100 guys are digging tunnels under the nuclear reactor and it's hot. they can't use fans due to dust and blah blah blah so these men strip completely naked while they work. my immature ass thinks this is hilarious! i saw more junk in that 30 second scene than i've seen in 10 years. i'm giggling like a middle schooler pointing at all the penises. my boyfriend didn't find it as funny, but that's another story. the episode ends, all is well and i go to bed.  

then, this morning is when the fuck up happens. i'm chatting with some coworkers during break and someone asks me how my night was. my poor attempt at being funny was to respond with, ""it was pretty awesome, i saw a bunch of naked miners."" everybody kind of froze and just stared at me....i didn't clue in for the longest time. i just stared blankly back at them. nobody laughed at all and i could feel my anxiety closing my throat when it dawned on me. they thought i said naked minors! 

the english language is fucked up sometimes!   i quickly explained what i was actually talking about. everybody got a great kick out of it but i'm still the office creep now.  

tl:dr i said i saw a bunch of naked miners, but everyone thought i said naked minors.",4
"my two cents and deep concern about this sub.. hey all. me (m28) and my girlfriend (f23) have been long time lurkers on this sub. we have a happy and fulfilling relationship with trust, love, and passion. we have been through our ups and downs, but our relationship is incredible. 

we were reading a post today about a woman who said she found suspicious messages when going through her husbands facebook. also in her story she said that their two toddlers were taking up most of the free time and their marriage was hitting a rough spot, like many people struggle with the same situation.

fast forward to the comments. this is where my concern starts. misery loves company. period. the amount of cutting, negative, ""divorce him and move on, gohrl he lyin"" comments were unbelievable, and the same goes for almost every top post on this sub...

all i'm saying is be careful, y'all. especially the younger people who come here for advice. relationships take work, relationships are hard sometimes, and relationships take compromise. i hope that these folks understand that they're probably taking that cutting ""advice"" from middle aged, three time divorced cat ladies with strange colored hair, or dudes who are manipulative and have never had a successful relationships. who's got time for that?

mods, remove this post if i'm breaking any rules. but maybe its a good idea to put some sort of flair on username so people can be a bit more selective about where said advice is coming from. for example ""marriage counseling works"" or ""three times divorced cat lady""

just my two cents. sorry about the rant.

"general advice-when you mess up and are apologizing, don't put yourself down. not because you're being too hard on yourself. because it's manipulative. 

when you are apologizing to your partner for hurting them, don't turn around and say, ""i'm such a pos and i hate myself for doing it"". because of that person cares about you, you know they'll just end up comforting you. so why did this moment of you accepting responsibility and apologizing turn into you being comforted? 

apologizing is for your partner. not you. if you're feeling low and need validation, do that after the apology and do it in a ""this is how i'm feeling"" way. ",7
"july 16th, 2017 was the death date i decided for myself.. i went down a dark path for myself in 2016-17. nights of being drunk or high on oxycontin. gliding a knife gently on my wrist and then gently adding pressure until i saw myself bleed. 

i knew i was depressed. secretly, i've always been depressed but it really took control of me that year. 

i don't ever support drunk driving, but i must admit, i did it a lot. i hoped that i'd flip my car. but i never did. 

i didn't tell anyone of my constant thoughts of suicide or self harm. i didn't want anyone to know. i didn't want people to think i was just wanting attention. i didn't want people to think i was ""weird"" or being dramatic. i kept it to myself which is one of the most dangerous things someone can do when they have depression. 

the little voice in your head gets louder, more aggressive, mean, vile and evil. telling you, you're not good enough. telling you to just end it all. telling you no one loves you. telling you you're a waste of life. 

it's hard not to listen when the voice is constantly in your head. it dictates everything. i wondered to myself if i was ""crazy"".

i couldn't bare with myself. i cried all the time, alone. 

july 15th, 2017, i bought more than enough drugs to end my life. i was determined and ready for it. i wanted everything to stop. i wanted peace. 

i decided, for my last day on earth, i was going to do the one thing i loved and resorted to a lot. video games. 

i joined a random lobby. i usually didn't talk to others online, just throw music on and listen to that as i played. mute the other players. 

 but before i could mute the players, a woman in the lobby tried talking to me. she tried to include me in the conversation she and her friends were having. something told me to respond and join in the conversation. which i've never done before or cared to do. 

she was funny, she made me laugh. she included me into every conversation she and her friends shared. we joked, we laughed. for once in a long time, i didn't feel like ending my life or causing harm to myself. she told me to add her, and so i did. 

almost 2 years later, she's the love of my life. i'm hers and she's mine. she has no problem flaunting that. 

she has 2 kids from a previous relationship. she loves me and they love me. they call me dad, because their real dad is a shitty person. 

she helped me with my drug and alcohol abuse. she drove me back and forth from a drug rehabilitation centre for my opioid abuse. she waited in the centre for me while i got my daily dose of methadone to treat my oxycontin abuse. 

once the doctors at the centre trusted me enough to give me my own prescription of methadone so i didn't have to travel so far every day, she helped remind me to take it. 

she also encouraged me to see counselling and to go on antidepressants. i did, though it was a painful journey to find what antidepressant worked best for me, i did it. i feel happier and never have a thought about killing or harming myself. 

she gave me a family. she gave me love. she gave me happiness and no matter how difficult or stubborn. i was, she never gave up on me. 

she held me through my dark moments and eased the bad thoughts away with her words and touch. i can honestly say i've never felt that before. simply to put it, 

she saved my life. 

we've cried together, laughed together, been angry at each other among other things but we always ended the day with saying ""i love you"" to each other. 

just tonight, she dealt with my drunk ass and made sure i was safe. 

right now, i'm writing this while laying beside her as she sleeps. i love her. 

in the new few months i plan to propose to her and her kids. i will be the best step dad, husband and best friend to her. her and her kids are my everything. we have plans to expand our family too. 

she came into my life just at the right time. i'm grateful. i'm also lucky that we ended up living very close to each other. she has supported me through my rough times and i've supported her. 

i was never the one to believe in love but now that i'm in the place that i'm in, i do believe in it. it just takes time. 

thank you for reading. :)

edit: i just want to thank all of you people for reading my story. thank you for commenting and sharing your experiences with me. my intent while writing this post was to shine hope to people who are going through similar experiences. thank you for the slivers, gold and platinum. i encourage anyone to share this with a loved one, friends, lovers etc. a lot people hide in the dark with their depression and are scared to come forth with it and it shouldn't be that way. please speak up. <3",11
"by exposing myself to my wife's friend. this happened on friday, and i'm just now able to relive it without experiencing tourette-like outbursts of random noises and profanity from my extreme discomfort from the embarrassment.

i'm sitting on the toilet in the downstairs bathroom (which is right by the front door of our house), i have the door mostly closed, but it's not latched. doorbell rings, my wife answers it, it's her friend jen. jen comes in the house. i should mention that jen is a friend/neighbor we've known for just under a year and i don't really know her that well, which, for me, makes this worse.

i'm just finishing up, getting ready to wipe. i pull on the first piece of toilet paper, and as the toilet paper unrolls this big, and very fast spider comes running from behind the roll, brushing against my hand. instinctively, i jump up and away from this spider, as i do this, the door to the bathroom opens, there's jen, we both scream, me because my fight or flight (in this case flight) response automatically kicks in from my lizard brain thinking i'm getting attacked by this spider, and jen seeing her friend's husband with his pants and underwear down between his legs leaping toward her screaming.

a lot of apologies and light uncomfortable laughter afterwards, and i haven't slept well since.

tl;dr: by exposing myself to my wife's friend when i jumped from a spider while sitting on the toilet, right when my wife's friend walked into the bathroom.

"for not allowing meat to be served at my wedding?. i'm a gen 1.5 indian migrant to the uk (was born in india but moved when i was 6 with parents) so while i grew up british and consider myself to be british, i still have family in india and my indian heritage is an important part of my identity. my wife is 4th gen indian - her family immigrated decades ago so she, and her parents grew up fully anglicised. i'd like to stress there's nothing wrong with that - why should she have ties to a country her grandparents were born in?

due to the difference in culture we are having two weddings - one in england for all her family and our friends, and one in india for the rest of my family and friends there. we had the first wedding, which was very traditional and western  - church, reception etc. it was great, and we had fun. now the wedding in india - it's important as my grandparents are too old to fly to the uk so i'd love for them to see me get married. 

the problem comes with the menu - in a hindu wedding, and especially in the south, you don't serve meat. you just don't. in fact, what's served at a wedding is something called a sadya(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sadhya). it's fully vegetarian, and served on a banana leaf - super traditional. my wife says we should allow meat, despite the cultural taboo - saying her side of the family 'won't be able to cope' without meat. i'm of the opinion that they're all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it's that bad run to a kfc after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. it's also not like there won't be any meat - there'll be non veg food at the sangeet, there'll be meat at the reception. 

also during the english wedding i sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being hindus don't partake, but i told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. 

so, for not wanting meat at the wedding?",3

"i cut myself last night to try and relieve the nagging nerve pain i've had for years and it worked.. conflicted i've had crushed discs and a cyst on my spine for about 10 years now. on the daily, the pain is manageable, but when it flares up, i have nagging, burning pain in my hip, down the front of my calf, and into my ankle. i tried to get in to see my doctor yesterday, but he's out of town. i have an appointment on monday. heat and ice didn't help. stretching didn't help.

it felt like if i could just reach the area inside my leg that hurt and press on it, the pain would go away. i was so desperate. i'm so, so tired of this pain. so i took a small blade, found the most painful point, and inserted it in my leg. it didn't hurt at all to do and the relief was instantaneous. the nerve pain went away from that point down. i could still feel it higher on my leg, so i made another cut. i made a total of seven. it feels like i can reach the area that hurts now. i don't want the holes to close because then i won't be able to reach the spots to make them stop hurting.

i know i shouldn't have done this. i've never purposely injured myself before. i'm just really tired.",12
"by handing my usb to my roommate. **gonna use a throwaway. i'm not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** 

i had an essay to print out this weekend but since i no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down to the print shop. so, i wasted no time copying all my shit to a usb and grabbing my coat. i was literally just about to shut the door behind me when i heard my roommate calling my damn name. he wanted something printed out as well. a fucking flyer or some shit. random, but ok whatever. 

he asked if he could use my usb. i didn't see why not, so i said sure. once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my usb and said: ""valar morgulis, motherfucker"". i said: ""valar dohearis, you degenerate turd"" and bounced. the print shop was busy when i got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. little did i know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.

i handed the cute print shop girl my usb with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. as far as i knew, there was nothing else on the usb except those two documents. print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. her expression was unreadable. like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. she leaned in and sheepishly asked: ""which two files, sir?"". i replied: ""only the two you see on there"". 

at that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. folders that never even existed when i copied my essay. here's the damn punchline. all these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:

**""tiny twink drilled hard by handsome handyman""**

**""college stud drains his big uncut cock""** 

**""cute boy fucked in the ass by daddy""**

**""teasing my drunk straight friend with raw dick""**

**""high school hunks fuck bareback""** 

**""hung doctor gets head after physical""**

**""planet of the bottoms: dawn of da dick""** 

there were loads more, but i'm sure ya'll get the pornographic picture. i shook my head in horror and said: ""that ain't mine"". print shop girl's eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. 

""what should i print for you, sir?"" 

""it's my roommate... he does this kinda shit""

""of course""

*crickets*

i swallowed what remained of my dignity and did what had to be done. 

""print the one called assignment, please. under, uh... all ass all access. thank you""

**tl:dr i walked into my local print shop with an essay i had to print out. walked out looking like a porn addict.**

*edit: ya'll giving me too much attention. appreciate the rewards though. just wanna provide feedback to some of the comments. i requested that print shop girl expand the display settings to show the number of files in each folder. all the folders had 0 files except one: ""all ass all access"". that's how i located my essay. for the record, i'm not gonna revenge-prank my damn roommate by fucking him. also, this throwaway isn't to hide this post from him, i just don't wanna have him think these little stunts of his are worthy of living on the reddit account i use daily. hence, an account that will eventually become obsolete. valar morghulis, ya'll.*",4

"for asking my wedding guest to leave for wearing his military uniform at my wedding?. the son of one of my husband's family friends showed up to my wedding in his marines formal wear, complete with all his medals. now, i have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. my wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.

up until the point that i asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which i don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. if he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  i felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!

i felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.

"by having a seizure and going full mma on the six cops trying to help get me in the ambulance. checking my email is the last normal thing i remember before waking up in the hospital, except for a few scary-as-fuck bits here and there. hence, this comes from my own direct recollection, with the gaps filled in by my wife and other witnesses.

i had a full tonic-clonic seizure, right at my desk. details are mostly irrelevant, here, but i've never had a seizure before. (and initial assessment is that it was probably a ""perfect storm"" situation with a new prescription i was on that will (hopefully) never happen again.)

my wife was in the next room and of course called 911, and the ambulance showed up. problem is, i was postictal(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postictal_state?oldformat=true), which is a post-seizure state where you're essentially not in your right mind. but when two big dudes came into my house unannounced and in a big hurry to move towards me, i went into home-defense mode. the fact that they were clearly in emt uniforms and there to help me was lost in the scrambled mess my brain was in, but my more basic instincts were working fine. i don't think i actually assaulted the emts, as they just kept their distance and radioed for police backup when i started yelling at them telling them (apparently) ""get the fuck out of my house. i don't wanna fight you.""

and so the police sent one guy.

now i remember feeling extremely protective of my wife and convinced that this home invasion was serious business now that this 3rd guy was coming towards me and attempting to physically restrain me. i don't remember, but i'd bet you dollars to donuts that the millisecond he rolled his shoulders forward and widened his stance is the second that i went from uncooperative to full apeshit; it's just what you do when you're trained to fight and there doesn't seem to be another option, as when you are protecting your family like i thought i was about to have to do.

that's when things started getting ugly. i was an amateur mma fighter about fifteen years ago with a local dojo, and while i haven't practiced for a long time, i can tell you those instincts never fully leave you. i know how to reverse any submission hold a local cop is likely to be able to proficiently attempt on me, apparently even whilst postictal. before backup arrived, i had swept the leg of the officer and had him in an armbar. thank fuck i didn't go for a blood choke whilst my brain was short-circuiting. i was also screaming (roaring, apparently) at my wife to call the police. the irony of my request was lost on me at the time. that primal roar was the scariest sound she's ever heard come out of my body, so she tells me, and i didn't stop roaring. luckily (for him and me), cop #1 didn't put up any further resistance until his backup arrived.

five more big dudes showed up (now 6 cops + 2 emts + my wife). no weapons drawn, no tasers. fortunately they knew they were walking into a medical call, and boy they should get a medal for how well they handled it.

i wasn't going down without a fight, and 1v1 was no contest even though they were way above my weight class. but with sheer overwhelming force they pretty much wore me out and then dogpiled me to the ground, cuffed me in the back, and then stood me up to walk me to the ambulance. big mistake. i easily spun my way out of the officer's control grip (hand on handcuff chain, other hand on my shoulder), and gave him a front kick to the breadbasket he probably won't forget anytime soon. ""bring it, fuckers,"" i remember thinking (or saying? who knows). i also remember being this weird mix of scared, emboldened by my recent ""escape"", and pissed *right* the fuck off, all at the same time.

still cuffed, front kicks were the new order of the day. i was like the goddamn free sample guy at the supermarket, giving them out to anyone who came near me. details are loose on what happened next, but i guess they did some kind of brute force team tackle again and got me to the ground, and from the cuts on my wrists, they may have used some kind of pain compliance technique with the cuffs. it didn't work, as i was able to shrimp my way out from underneath the guy(s) on top of me and throw a nasty double heel kick from lying down. fortunately it just grazed the guy on the shoulder rather than the neck/head, which is where i would certainly have been aiming.

next thing i remember vividly is being face down on my living room carpet barely able to breathe (thanks to being out of shape these days, with at least one big guy on my back), and thinking this was the end for me, then they'd rape my wife, and let my cat out in the cold winter night.

they weren't screwing around at this point. apparently judging it worth the risk, while i was pinned the emts shot me in the ass with some kind of chemical restraint, and the cops just sort of sat on me and let my wife try to calm me down until it had taken full effect and i was strapped to the gurney in soft restraints.

when i woke up (over a full day later--combination of insomnia + seizure + downers + 1v6 cage match really wore me out, i guess), i was bruised to shit, but aside from some minor cuts on my wrists from the cuffs and a nasty hole in my bottom lip from me biting it during the seizure, i'm a lot better off than i could have been. i have some nasty pins and needles in my hands so those cuffs must have been torqued fairly hard (by me or the cops, who knows), but i'm told by my attending doctor that should go away in about six months(!).

when got home i called the police to apologize and thank them for getting my combative ass to the ambulance. thanks to them for being incredibly good sports about the whole thing. (and not pressing charges, especially given my level of...enthusiasm.)

i'm still trying to wrap my head around just how badly this *could* have gone. yeesh. the unpredictable seizure alone is bad enough without nearly suiciding-by-cop had there been a weapon within reach. scares the bejesus out of me just knowing how absolutely out of control i was.

tl;dr: i learned exactly how many big dudes with at least basic hand-to-hand training it takes to drag me from my home against my will. (six, plus a syringe of something in the ass.)

edit: well, this was a much bigger response than i expected. thanks for all of your comments (especially those from police and medical professionals and other patients that have gone through something similar). and, wow, thanks for the gold, kind strangers.

"by making my cousin agree to hooking up with me.  

this happened today morning and i am still thinking how to process it. this is gonna be a long rant.

i have another account that i use professionally so this is a throwaway.

going for a stressful period in life and so i often hang out with my cousin and we too are really close in a sibling way. so, coming to today i live in 2 rooms on the first floor - an old room where everything from my previous flat is stocked and is more of a store room and the other is where i work and live 24x7. i woke up early to try clean my old store room and was rummaging through some old dvds and stuff.also made double sure i had the condoms hidden away in a box and whilst doing so, a client who had been avoiding paying me called - i dropped everything and got into the call which ended with me throwing away my phone and the tempered glass cracks. no worries, i got another one- meanwhile cousin was laughing away hysterically at me. i was trying to get the new temper on and realized i need to wipe it, given how lazy i am i asked her to go get some wet wipes from the other room and told her which box had it. she went and disappeared for nearly half an hour. given, how absent minded she can be i did not think anything of it and kept the phone aside for now.

later, she comes to the room with a very serious look, somewhat teary eyes and asked me if i really wanted this ? i said ""yes, i have been waiting forever for this"" and i mimicked her serious tone just for kicks. next thing i know she has jumped on top of me and is kissing me - not the brotherly kiss btw and i sat there all frozen and for some reason i did not move a muscle to throw her off me. i just froze. she starts stripping and i said something like why/how...its a bit foggy there. she says see saw the strawberry condoms, the adele dvd and the old box had this pretty please designed on it. strawberry is her favourite and adele is her weakness. so, my poor cousin struggled with the moral dilemma for a good 30 minutes before coming to me to ask me and i stupidly said yes. i put the condoms instead of the wet wipes (both have some bluish covers) that stupid adele album is here favourite.

thankfully, before she could disrobe and this went any further, we heard my mother shouting from below that lunch is ready. i quickly made my exit without blinking for a second and had my lunch without choking myself. mom dragged my cousin to the market for some shopping and my cousin told me with great sadness in her voice ""i am there for you""

i am writing this now knowing i might have messed up my relationship with her forever.

i know i will tell her the truth when she comes back but such a series of coincidences is too hard to be believed

their answer was ""yes"", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. at least in our names, our family is protected. we think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.

they've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this october. but we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. this is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. but it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.

we would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. but instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. this is like the difference of a factor of two. we spent our money needlessly.

i'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. my husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. i don't think they did it with malice ""hehe we get a bigger house if we lie"", but i think they knew they didn't want children. you don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?

would i be the asshole for selling their home? we'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. they'd never be homeless.

**edit**

just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. the problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. children need extra space. now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.

our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. in our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. this is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. there's already been hubbub between my children ""why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom"", etc. ""because they're having children"" can't be our reasoning anymore.",3

"for getting defensive about a birthday gift i gave to a friend?. for a friend's birthday i got him a budget record player from amazon along with 10 old vinyls from a second hand shop. he is pretty into music so i thought it would be a cool gift. plus i'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.

after i gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. here enters pretentious music snob (pms), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.

pms: (asking me) how much did you get it for?

me: 60 dollars.

pms: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. it's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.

i thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but i gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.

my friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. 

pms: the speakers sound pretty crap.

friend: i think it sounds fine.

pms: you know what you can do? you should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. here's the setup i have at home. (pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) the one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.

at this point i was pretty annoyed. he might be right, but i think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when i was right next to him. so i decided to call him out.

me: hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)

the room became silent and it got pretty awkward. i know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling pms out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but i reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.

so aita?

edit: i posted this before going to bed (i live in australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but holy crap this blew up. here's some additional info:

when birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. so when pms was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. 

to be honest i'm not a confrontational person and i wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. i said what i said to a) shut him up, i wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes b) yes i said it in a way that embarrassed him. i'm not a saint, i didn't take the high road, but i sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. 

when i said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. i've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since pms was also annoying him. 

i posted this to see if my response was appropriate and that i didn't over escalate it. my conclusion is that sometimes you gotta be an asshole yourself to stand up to a bully and i don't regret what i did.",3
"target charged me a $3.18 without explanation. check your cc statements.. i was checking my credit card statement this morning and i saw a charge i made at target.com for a christmas present but right next to it was another charge from target for $3.18.  i called their customer service number to ask what the charge was.  i gave them my previous order number and they said the total cost of the order was the exact difference from what i received in my email.  so i have an email saying the price was $122.16 but then they just decided ""nope, changed our minds.  price will now be $125.34."" and made a separate charge to make up the difference without any notification.  they said as a ""one time courtesy"" that they would refund me the difference but could not explain to me where it came from (shipping?  tax?).  just a warning for those of you out there because i wonder how many of these small charges fall through the cracks.

edit: some extra details.  target confirmed that they made the charge (though the call center rep couldn't tell me why) so it's not a spoofed charge to check if my cc is valid.  my confirmation email from them includes tax and notes that shipping is free.  so it's not an adjustment for sales tax.  if they did need to charge me for shipping after all, they should at least send me an email asking if that's okay or if i want to cancel the order.

"i (22m) crossed a major boundary, how do we (21f) talk about it?. hey guys, first off i apologize if my formatting isn't very ""reddit-like"". i almost never actually post on reddit.

so i made a mistake tonight..and i'm ashamed of myself because this was completely out of character for me..but now i need to fess up. i'm going to give a bit of context and then sum up my questions underneath.

&#x200b;

my girlfriend left her laptop with me because it died and she needed me to try to recover family photos and documents from the last 7 years that would have all been lost. while transferring the data i was popping in and out of folders to make sure everything was being captured, when a particular phrase on one of the screenshots in a photo folder caught my eye..something she says to me often and we've come to sort of associate the phrase with us. the screenshot was her confession of love to someone she was with before i was around, ending with that quote, our quote.

&#x200b;

i couldn't leave well enough alone..and the next thing i knew i had opened up her internet browser..sure enough facebook was logged in. and i searched that phrase in the conversation history. there were..more than a few results. i read through some of them, more than i'd like to admit. i couldn't believe how many guys she had dated before me, she had never hidden it from me. i knew she had dated alot more people than i had, but the number of guys..i wasn't expecting it. many of them she had said similar or the exact same things she says to me. some conversations she had even sent out the same ""intimate"" photos i received from her when we started dating. (some of the guys were within a short span and didn't last very long) i'm a little hurt to be honest. alot of the things i thought were exclusive to us were not, is this normal? i've always intentionally avoided saying things i used to say to exes.

&#x200b;

that aside, i know i messed up. i completely betrayed her trust by going through all those conversations and i need to come clean about it. on one hand i'm a little hurt..on the other i shouldn't have even known about this.  how can i discuss this with my partner in a healthy way? is it fair for me to feel a little hurt at the same time?

edit: ok i wanted to clarify because alot of you seem to think i'm expecting an apology from her which i'm definitely not. i know that i screwed up and shouldn't have snooped. i violated a major boundary and i would be pissed if i were her (that's why i feel it needs to be confessed)  for the sake of being honest and open i'm going to talk to her about it and face the fallout. i think some of you are right and i have some..confused feelings about it. to my knowledge i don't make her feel anywhere close to what she's expressed with past partners and it is a little upsetting, not because i'm not the first one or because she's had ""too many"". that's not at all what i'm getting at..


&#x200b;

 tl;dr i snooped through my girlfriend's facebook chats with her exes and realized she says the exact same things to me that she said to all of them, and i feel bad for violating her trust and need to confess to her what i did.

update: hey everyone! sorry for the delay between posts. 

so we talked it out. she agreed that it was an invasion of privacy but also says i have her permission to go through her messages anytime but to just tell her first..not the response i had expected. we had a decent conversation about both sides. everything is good between us. thank you all for your insights and messages it's greatly appreciated!",7
"i stole my first stepmom's wedding ring. bit of backstory, my first stepmom was a lunatic. she treated her son (my stepbrother) like he was her husband, rather than my father. she would take him, my sister, and i to the store, buy him a super cool, expensive toy, then berate my sister and i for asking for something too (and it would usually be nothing even close to being as expensive or big as what he got). she would let him bully me, including knocking out my four front teeth (which i had to go without for almost a year cause the teeth weren't ready to come out) and every time i tried to fight back he would immediately cry and run to her and i would get in trouble from her and my father, who only went along with her shenanigans cause he wanted someone to take care of him (aka a wife). 

the final straw was when my half brother was born. i was only 7, but i was expected to raise him. i had to feed him at ungodly times in the night while my dad and step mom slept, i had to change his diapers, bathe him, all of the things you had to do for a baby and all the while i was expected to still do well in school and choir (which i ended up having to quit because of all this). 

one day, they left me home alone (another thing they did frequently) and i decided enough was enough. my stepmom had taken her wedding ring off for who knows why and i saw my opportunity to mess with her. i went into their bathroom and just snatched it up, along with a couple other pretty rings i saw. i hid it in a hole in the couch that only i knew about and waited. 

well she gets home and has a fit cause she can't find her ring and of course accused me, but for once my dad stood up for me and said i would never. i left the ring there for a couple days until she gave up and had to believe she had just lost it. i then moved it to a toy box in my room where i forgot about it for many years. me stealing the ring was the first in several things that caused their marriage to fall apart (not that they needed any help, they constantly fought from day 1 of their relationship). i found it again when i was moving out of my dad's house at 18, and by then my crazy stepmom divorced my dad and he remarried to another lunatic lady (hence why i moved out before i even graduated high school). i still have the ring, as it's very pretty and it constantly reminds me how i basically ended my dad and first stepmom's marriage. i still think it's hilarious to this day.

"for refusing to lift something heavy for a woman as a man?. i was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while i was working at my desk, but when i got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. i was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while i was working just because i was the nearest available man, so i refused. the other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought i was joking, so i kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. i thought one of them should have done it in the first place.

am i the asshole?

edit: to clarify, the women in the break room weren't on official breaks. they just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. there are no official break times in my workplace. also, i was working on something at my desk when i was asked to lift said object.

edit 2: at the time of being asked, i was asked to help ""lift something"" in the break room. i assumed it was a package of mail or paper and i didn't know i'd be doing it myself, nor did i know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.

edit 3: this was not the first time in the day i refilled the dispenser. i'm the closest man who sits near the break room, so i'm regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. however, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn't exactly petite either — none of them in the break room are. furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it's placed on the dispenser. i have also witnessed a 4'11"" woman change the bottle, so height isn't exactly much of an issue here.

edit 4: the woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. she is also married with children and i'm the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, i highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.

edit 5: i never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume i did. i just refused to do the task for her.

edit 6: i am not the strongest person in the office — far from it. i don't lift weights and stay slim out of preference. we even have some female gym fanatics here. also, i barely know the woman who asked me. she's in another department in another part of the office.

update: i very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. she still defends chivalry, while i obviously find it illogical. our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. yes, everything i posted happened almost a decade ago. our discovery sparked a heated discussion and i wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others' viewpoints to close our debate. i put little effort in my original post without thinking i'd get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.

i'm still employed with this company, and some involved have left. if there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. i'm glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. it's no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and i am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men. our head of hr also announced in a staff meeting that we'll be employing more men to bridge the gender gap in our office, and some married coworkers told me they've even made positive changes at home as well — all stemming from a seemingly petty ordeal.",3

"by jacking off to my mom. throwaway for obvious reasons.

holy fuck i can't believe i'm writing this.

to give you some context, my mom used to be an adult actress. she has been pretty open about it in the past, and my family doesn't really judge her for it. she stopped about 5 years ago after she got pregnant with my sister and hasn't looked back.

today i was doing the five knuckle shuffle to one of those compilations (i don't want to be judged, so i won't say any more). you can probably see where this is going. just as i was about to bust a nut, it cut to an old video of my mom. i could definitely tell it was her because she looked directly at the camera for a second, but the machine was already in motion. i tried everything i could but it was too late.

later on i went downstairs to watch tv and i couldn't even look at my mom. this is definitely gonna be an awkward few months. one thing's for sure, from now on i think i'll just use my imagination.

"psa: useful personal finance loopholes. a lot of personal finance advice is straightforward applications of math: keep expenses less than income.  pay off highest interest rate debts first.  compound growth is your friend.

then there are obvious legal requirements and benefits:   use tax-preferred retirement / hsa accounts.  keep insurance in force.   know how self-employment taxes work. 

this post is about less-obvious but still interesting-to-redditors ways to use loopholes / benefits in existing us laws to your advantage.  there's an endless number of these, but some come into play frequently enough that it makes sense to raise awareness about  them.  our friends in other countries, especially the uk and canada, are welcome to lobby for local versions in their associated personal finance subs, see links in the sidebar. i don't know those laws...

here are some that you may not already know about:

tax planning:

- if you earn less than 30k single / 60k jointly, you can use the saver's credit(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit for a portion of your ira or 401k contributions, even for roth contributions. full-time students are not eligible.

- you pay no taxes at all on long-term capital gains(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/no-capital-gains-due-for-some-investors-1.aspx) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 15% tax bracket.  that could be $95,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly.  this is better than a roth in that you can do this at any age.

- sales of a personal residence often have no capital gains tax(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-gains-and-your-home-sale-1.aspx) as well.  various rules apply.  

- if you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) can be schedule e expense deductions against your rental income(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income).  

- take advantage of ""adjustments(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/cut-your-taxes-without-itemizing-1.aspx)"" like student loan interest, tuition, moving costs, etc., that don't require itemization if you are eligible.  

retirement:

- employer contributions to your 401k don't count(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/employer-match-counts-toward-401k-limit.aspx) against the 18k limit.  

- if you change you mind about making an ira contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be allowable, you can simply remove the money(https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

-  for redditors with more ""life experience"", you can increase your contributions (https://www.trustetc.com/resources/investor-awareness/contribution-limits) to a 401k and ira at age 50, and your hsa contributions  at age 55.

- self-employed people have lots of options(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts.  this can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.

- think you make too much to contribute to roth ira?  think again!  the ever-popular backdoor roth ira(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  but no, i am not adding the mega-backdoor roth.  there are some places even i won't go.

health insurance:

- if you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (cobra) coverage.  this works retroactively(http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take cobra at day 59 and be covered for the previous 59 days.  yes, we get that cobra is expensive.  but it's free if you wait to elect it and don't need it, but you're still covered because you can elect it retroactively.  any other health insurance you'd have to pay for but probably still not use.

- you won't pay a penalty for lack of health insurance if you have a single  brief coverage gap(http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-coverage-gap-exemption/), which is defined as ""less than three months.""  i.e. may 1 to july 28 is ok.  may 1 to july 31 is not.

"by adding my colleagues breast milk to my coffee.. this happened about 45min ago. some background info: my colleague, let's call her karen, just got back from mat leave and apparently has been proactively emptying her jugs at lunch time using a breast pump.

so about an hour ago, i started fixing up my daily post-lunch cup of joe when i opened the staff fridge. to my horror there was no more dairy (typically myself and another colleague take turns  supplying cream/milk for the entire office because we're the heavy coffee drinkers). after shuffling around food for 30seconds or so, on the back shelf, i saw a bottle (not quite a baby bottle) filled with some kind of milk. now i wasnt about to drink my coffee black like some kind of psychopath, so without any hesitation, i grabbed the bottle and loaded my coffee up. despite the coffee tasting a hint more sweet, i thought nothing of it.

15min later, cue karen going into the fridge and noticing her bottle has moved. not just that, her superhuman attention to detail has noticed the bottle isnt as full as before and proceeds to go on a witch hunt around the office, yelling ""who the fuck drank my breast milk???"".

"we should stop the women and children first mentality.. i do think children should go first when it comes to things but women shouldn't go first just because they are a woman. and this goes for anything, food, shelter, going first in line. whatever it doesn't matter. this is mainly pertaining shelter and natural disaster type situations though. it's always women and children first. adult women are not more valuable than an adult male and should be seen as easily replaceable. men should not have to go last just because they are a man and history says women come first with that stuff.  it's harmful to the ""everyone is equal"" movement that has been going on for the best several years.

"i'll only accept feminists wanting more female ceos when they start fighting for more female bricklayers, sewage cleaners and garbage collectors. i'm sorry women, you don't get to have your cake and eat it too.

if you want 50% of ceos to be women, or 50% of every company's board members to be women, you should also be working for 50% of sewage cleaners to be women, 50% of garbage collectors to be women, 50% of builders to be women etc. you get where i'm coming from.

at the end of the day, women get the cushy jobs like being a barista, or a teacher. i'm not saying these jobs don't present their own sets of challenges but they don't really require you to get your hands dirty in the same way the jobs left for men do. 

i've got a lot of respect for women who do jobs like garbage collection which is mainly done by men, because you are showing that women can do these kinds of jobs.

"by encouraging my husband in bed and ruining sex for the day nsfw. so as usual, this wasn't today but last weekend.
after a busy workweek where me and my husband had been coming home, and pretty much passing out at the end of the day, we figured a saturday afternoon would be the perfect time for some quality alone time.
i'd been teasing him for the morning whilst we did general household chores and finally dragged him upstairs mid afternoon to get down to business! 

everything started off brilliantly, the clothes got thrown, things got hot and quickly led into some excellent 69ing.
now, my husband is deft of finger and pretty quickly had me moaning with pleasure and a very intense orgasm. 
we quickly switched to him on top and i was encouraging him to go harder so that he could have a great finish as well. still all good so far! i continued to egg him on, telling him to step up his game and finish him. (no body slam moves required)
....

after a particularly enthusiastic thrust i suddenly got a stab of pain in my side, making me curl up in agony. he mistook this for intense pleasure (apparently my pain face is similar to my sexy face? not sure how to take that one!) and kept going for a couple more plunges before it finally became obvious to him as i burst into tears!

this lead into him panicking that he'd somehow broken me with his cock (he may be overestimating there) and me trying to figure out wtf had just happened and why i was crying. i'm guessing it something to do with the lovely stabbing cramps in my right hand side of my abdomen. possibly.
cue the naked running around as he grabs hot water bottle and glass of water while i curl up on the bed, now very lacking in sex appeal.

turns out that if you have pcos (polycystic ovary syndrome), 'enthusiastic exercise' can sometimes cause a ovarian cyst to get over excited and burst! 

worst part was, we were trying to fit in this fun time before his parents came over for dinner and now, 20 minutes before they arrive am now stuck in an ungainly position on the bed, totally starkers for all to see. 
i had to phone his mum to ask if she had any ibuprofen she could bring round for me as we had none in the house and then had to try and explain exactly why i needed them. luckily she had the sense to not ask any further questions when i said it can be triggered by certain types of exercise.

managed to get husband to help me pull some clothes on moments before they arrived, so saved some of my dignity at last.
he's now convinced his dick is cursed and is going to break me again.

"by trying to be my boyfriends hero. sorry in advance for mobile formatting.

so this happened yesterday night, here is some context.

i am a serial sprainer, in the 4 years my boyfriend has lived with me, i have sprained my ankle 7 times. i have tripped random stupid crap, dog toys, a rock in the grass, stairs, anything my ankles can find they will try to kill me on.

my boyfriend is always there, coddling me and nurturing my softball heels. i always thought one day i will be there to nurture his aches when he would fall.. but he never fell.

in the four years we have lived together he has never once slipped on ice, tripped on a rock, tumbled over an ottoman, or even dragged his foot across some slippery water.

that was until yesterday.

we were uber eats delivering in the lazy snowfall we had in kansas, thinking we might get some decent tips. we delivered to this townhome complex, he got out to deliver while i stayed in. on his way back to the car his phone chimed for another delivery. he pulled out his phone, and instead of paying attention down he went on a patch of ice.

he didn't fall and crack, he fell down with enough grace to land on his butt and his elbow. still, beggars can't be choosers. 

it was my turn.

i was going to coddle him now. i was going to nurture his swollen softball bumps. i was going to pick him up and help him to the car and baby him while he sniffled and reeled.

i was going to be the hero for once.. keyword being ""was.""

i lept out of the car. ""i can be your hero baby"" played in my head like elevator music. i felt my cape flowing figuratively behind my back.

suddenly i was on the ground, my knee twisted at an 80 degree angle. my hip felt the twist and it hurt so bad, i thought i broke it. unlike him, i did not fall gracefully. i hit the ground with such a thud that the lady in the car next to us got out ready to help me.

i laid there on the ground, air knocked out of me. enrique iglesias' ""hero"" stopped abruptly and instead sirens were blaring in my head. i instinctively wriggled my feet to see which one was going to get too thicc for socks.

everything seemed fine until i went to get up. nope. my knee was kaput, and i let out a gasp in surprise.

of course my boyfriend was up, not even bruised or limping, ready to swipe me up and buckle me into the car.

my boyfriend and this sweet lady was trying to help me up, but i elected to chubby lady crawl by the car so i could get up myself. i had them open the door and i crawled in, thanking the lady and buckling myself in.

as i sniffled and licked my wounds, he told me he was grateful that my first reaction was to try to help him. we laughed and joked about how funny it was. it was like a cartoon skit, i was peter griffin falling down and holding my knee, hissing between my teeth. one moment i was coming around the car the next i was on the ground with a shocked look on my face. i am still giggling about it.

he went to the store to get us some treats since we didn't want to end the night on a bad note, and once he disappeared into the store i just bawled and screamed. i think if anyone heard me they would think i was possessed.

i just wanted to be there for him for once, i felt so useless that even when he fell i couldn't help him. instead once again i was the victim of a sprain, only i wish it was my ankle. this time it is my knee, and i would rather sprain my ankle twice again. 

i composed myself by the time he got back to the car with skittles.

today i am confined to the bed, wishing we had our uber card already so we could get some crutches and gooey pizza. now i am browsing reddit until my phone dies then napping while it charges.

he on the other hand, doesn't even have a bruise to show for it.

boyfriend: 8
me: 0

tl;dr: i fall down a lot, my boyfriend never falls. he finally fell for the first time in 4 years, and when i went to help him. i fell down too and ended up spraining my knee.

"do you ever view ""not spending money"" as ""earning money""?. example:

tomorrow, i have to fly for business.  12 hours in the back of economy.  for $625, i could have upgraded to a lie-flat business class seat.  it was tempting, as i could *technically* afford it.  (i'm not rich by any means, but i'm not struggling.)

instead, i'm choosing to go without.  because the way i see it, in 12 hours i can either have some mild cramping that will pass in a day or two and $625 in my bank, or i can hopefully have a decent sleep but wake up with a large dent in my bank account.  

now, here's the thing: i would love that upgrade.  i've talked myself into it being a wise idea for a number of reasons.  so i've counted that money as being gone in a way - but by selling my shot at the upgrade, i've earned that $625.  

yes, i know i haven't actually gained more money by not spending it...but in a way, it feels like i have.  does anyone else ever treat big potential purchases this way?

"i'm sick of every tv show eventually having a left leaning overtone.. it seems like every show i watch lately starts off the same way. they steer clear of any sort of left or right overtone. it's not needed for the plot and they don't put it in. i start getting into the series and then the left talking points  start to creep in.

slowly but surely the left shit seeps into the show. it might take a couple of seasons but it always starts. i can't mention any of the actual issues because of the filters but you know what i'm talking about. 

can't i just watch a fucking tv series without a having left leaning agenda pushed at me, or for that matter any agenda? especially when it's just not fucking necessary to the plot of the show.

netflix especially seems to be experts at it. every god damn show i've watched on netflix starts as just a normal good series and 2 seasons in switches to propaganda.

"i've been lying about my age on this site, creating a whole fake persona.. on the internet, it can be very hard to be taken seriously. this is especially true if you're a teenager. 

for over two years now i've been insinuating and telling people that i'm a 25yr old engineer, when in reality i'm still a high-school teenager. 

it all started when in the comment section of a since-deleted r/politicalhumor post. i was debating some random guy when i accidentally revealed my age. after that, the whole argument went straight to insults and name-calling. ever since then i've been faking it for the sake of online credibility. i even went so far as to make fake stories about high-school a decade ago. 

recently, however, my urge to get internet validation has stagnated, and i just want to be myself again. i still think that there are many misconceptions about modern teen life, and that most people are too quick to assume we are superficial, braindead morons, but in my opinion it's better to be laughed at by others then to be artificial to yourself.

edit: thanks for all the support. i would just like to clarify a few things. first off, i don't advocate for revealing personal information online, notice i still haven't given you an actual number for my age just a range. i also think lying for safety is completely acceptable. i, personally, will just not reveal any personal information real or fake in the future. i also mentioned politicalhumor. i was not trying to defame any political group, just showing a subreddit where both sides can get tangled in over-passionate hostile arguments.

the only time i speak in a scottish accent, is when i'm around family. it can get pretty confusing if a mate is round, or lets say i meet a girl etc. i think the reason why i put on the accent was to fit in at school, because kids are cruel and would make fun of the native tongue, so i just kept it going all through high school up until now.

i've realised now at 21, how stupid it is that i had to fake an accent to fit into society. i think back now and wonder, what if i never faked my accent? would life be different? probably not.... but i just thought i'd share this with you all.

edit at the bottom: better timeline 

second edit at bottom: thank you and some understandings 

first of all, thank you to all the kind people who commented on my original post. those who told me to stick to my guns made me feel stronger and had saved me from further years of being totally stepped on. 

like the original post said, my boyfriend and i got into a heated argument because i, a rape survivor, was incredibly uncomfortable watching a clockwork orange with him. 

i had left our apartment for a few days and had some time to think. i've been with him for three years now and it is almost as if this tiny little bomb caused my whole world to blow up. i've realized how many times i've put my own feelings aside for him, how many things i have missed out on because i was busy catering to his feelings.

yesterday, i went home so we could talk. and needless to say, it didn't go well. he was still furious with me, claiming i never care about him or his interests. i counteracted this by listing almost everything i've done for him. i asked him why he was being like this, he knows what i've been through and has always been so understanding.

cue the real person that he is coming through. he said something along the lines of ""honestly, i was just going along with it because you seem like you needed support but i don't see the big deal."" asking me why i couldn't just ""get over it"" because it happened ""so long ago."" (i've been assaulted three times. once when i was ten, again at 16, and then again last year. but that's besides the point, even if it happened once a thousand years ago, it would still affect a survivor.) 

he then continued to blame me for his aggression, saying he was angry because we haven't had sex in a couple weeks. (i have bad spouts of body hatred due to my ptsd and do not like being touched when i'm in this headspace.) he advised that i maybe try going to therapy twice a week instead of just once and maybe that could help. 

i didn't know what to say or what to do. i was terrified of the man in front of me. all of this over a movie? i was shocked and hurt. so, i left. his name is on the lease so i'm not in any binds with him, thank god. i packed my shit and didn't look back. 

i'm still really shaken up. i've known him for so long and never saw this coming. it was like an immediate switch flipped on in his brain. i didn't know that man who i was talking to and i never want to again.

i'm staying at a friends place for now until i make enough to rent my own. very thankful for my steady job and even steadier friends.

just needed to get this off my chest i suppose. i haven't really told my friends the extent of what happened. i don't know why. maybe i'm embarrassed. i don't know. 

thank you all for the support. thank you for reading <3

edit someone commented and i now see the timeline seems a little murky. apologies that i wasn't more specific.

original fight happened on tuesday. i left that night and stayed out tuesday and wednesday nights. yesterday morning, i made my original post looking for a little bit of outside advice in this situation and then yesterday late evening is when this big blowout happened. apologies again for any confusion, i now see how it could've been a little weird because of my wording and lack of specifics!

edit 2 thank you for the two silver. i'm not sure why i've gotten them? but thank you. second, i've been thinking about it all day, really stewing on everything and thinking back to the past three years and the weeks leading up to this and i've realized that x wasn't as peaches and cream like i really thought him to be. yes, he was incredibly supportive and kind to me, especially surrounding my trauma. however, i believe this to be because i never said no to him. everything i did was to make him happy. these past couple weeks, i have started to say no to him. i really believe he never thought i would do this and it caused a lot of anger for him. the film isn't why we broke up, or why he blew up, the film was simply the ""final straw"" in terms of him tolerating me saying no. 

truly thank you for all the kind words and support. i really just posted this to vent and surely didn't expect all of this. <3",7
"by hugging my friend's sister!. i feel so embarrassed even typing about this even though this happened like an hour ago. i still can't believe i can be this stupid. me and my friend had  decided that we would meet at a certain point so that we could go have lunch to a place which was close to that point. he told me that even his sister would come along with him. and i was fine with it.

note: the problem was that i couldn't seem to remember how she looks because i rarely see her as she stays away from the family.

so back to the present, after sometime i hear someone say hi and i turn back to see who it was. it was my friend's sister who was walking towards me with her arms outstretched. i commit to the hug because if i didn't it would get awkward. so i hug her and it seemed she really wasn't into it. so i step back from her and check what's wrong.

now i realize i did two mistakes. 1. she wasn't my friend's sister. because my friend was exactly behind her and with him was a girl. and she was already laughing about it. 2. she actually wanted to hug a person who was behind me and that's why she extended her arms.

after that they were kinda shocked, i couldn't really tell what their emotions were because i just walked away.

after that embarrassment i hugged my friend and ' his sister '. and they mocked me until our lunch got over.

tl;dr : basically hugged someone else thinking it was my friend's sister.


edit : after seeing the reaction maybe this was not as embarrassing as i thought it would be.",4
"my son (12) went through tsa with carryon luggage and a backpack with money that is now missing...what do i do?. ok so my son left louisville early this am to fly to tampa and he had 2 envelopes with money in them in seperate pockets in his carryon luggage bag. when he went through screening he said his luggage was missing and could only find his backpack and shoes for a moment until his luggage finally came out. he stated  several other people behind him had already gotten their luggage. so it sounds like tsa placed his bag back through for some reason? he said they did not bring him over to open his bag and being 12 thought nothing of it, really. he went straight from tsa and boarded. his flight landed and i was at the gate waiting for him. when we got to the car he wanted to take the money out and have me put it in the bank for him. obviously, it was gone.  all he had in his luggage was literally only clothes and those 2 envelopes. what can i do really? 

edited to add update:
the money was his that he got for christmas. his dad held onto it until they got to tsa and said he watched my son place the envelopes in the bag in different pockets.

he is reasonably responsible with his money as well and had made plans to save it up for some nerf guns and such. i filed a report with tsa as well as contacted the airline and both airports lost and found. so hopefully we will get some answers soon or at least an idea. 

it definitely could have been somehow lost between tsa and the final gate but i think we have covered our bases as much as we can right now. unfortunately, it's one of those sucky life lessons.

"for wanting to abort my late husband's baby?. my husband died a week ago and i'm 13 weeks pregnant. my in-laws know and they want me to keep the baby so there's a piece of him alive. when i mentioned i might get an abortion they flipped out on me, called me every name in the book and selfish, at which point i broke down in tears and left.

i don't know what to do. on one hand i can understand what they mean, if i abort there's nothing of my husband left. but i just... don't know. i can end this chapter of my life and move on. i don't know what to do. i know a lot of you are thinking it's amazing i'm pregnant and i can always have a piece of him through my baby but that's the thing, i can't decide if i want that or not. i've never been more conflicted in my life and i have to stop thinking about it so i don't miscarry from the stress.

edit: i don't know how many people will see this but i want to thank everyone who offered support and shared their stories with me via pm, i'm truly moved. i'm still undecided on what to do moving forward but i i'll try and find someone to talk to. some more context if anyone's wondering:

*  my husband died by suicide because he was too stressed out about his career. no one really saw it coming.
*  i don't have any children, or family. my sister is the only one i know and she's on the other coast. i'm 25.
*  i don't know if i'm going to abort, however *if* i do carry the baby full term, i'd rather take care of it myself and not give it up for adoption.
*  i'm in new york which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. i'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.
*  my financial situation is... okay. i can support my baby and i if i budget down.
*  my relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. they didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.
*  some people are questioning why i'm trying to move on so fast and saying i'm awful for it: the baby is growing and i can't hit pause. i need to make up my mind sooner than later.

  my mind still isn't made up and likely won't be soon. i'll take some time off to think and talk to someone about this situation. also to the very colorful pm's telling me to kill myself, go fuck yourself. thank you.

"update. caught my wife cheating. what about her kids.. tl;dr i informed the ex that we would divorce and made arrangements for visitation.

sorry this update might be jumbled i originally updated in the wrong sub. this is the umpteenth time i have written this out, each time it's shorter. i not sure how to cross post so i am retyping, bear with me. last week was a busy week with daughter grad., moving her home, kids sports starting, lawyer, and the first face to face with wife. 

got home sunday, put daughter's stuff from apt. in garage. i get a call early evening from 14 yr. old. ""dad what's going on. no one is talking to us. mom and grandma are crying grandpa's yelling. is this because of what i told you?"" i assured him that his mom made a bad mistake, that he had nothing to do with this mess. he asked if i was packing up there stuff because he saw the uhaul in the driveway. i explained what happened and that all their stuff was remain there.

monday and wed. were sports nights. family sits in bleachers while i stand behind home plate backstop. my usual spot since i don't see eye to eye with fil. on the way across the field the oldest stops his warm up and rubs over to me. we hug and talk a few minutes then send him back. as i get my spot i have a 10 year old crash into me at full speed. i bend down hug and kiss him all over as he is squirming away. my fil asks if we could talk. we step away from earshot. he apologizes for the way he has treated me in the past and that he was wrong. well a little late but i accepted and said i knew that it was hard thing for him to do. he invited me to sit with them, i declined. he asked if i wanted to talk to wife. i said thursday would be better, do we set tinne and place.

tuesday comes meet with lawyer. i told him the whole story, he knew from his partner but wanted to hear from me. he asked what i wanted to do. i wanted to stay with the boys then stay married. the boys were most important.  he stated in his experience that the marriage would be a charade and not good for the boys. we could work out a visitation if wife is welling. as far as support he said i could do what i wanted for the boys. not to give her anything for me to control. the prenup was solid, she violated conditions, no support. he cautioned though that judges around the country have in some instances ordered child support in my case due to being in their lives so long. he did not think our judges have ruled that way in tgge past but you never know. he was sure her attorney would seek support. he suggested that we try to agree on everything we could before court, the the judge would look favorably on us.

before leaving he told me that every monday morning the partners meet to discuss new and on going cases. my previous attorney started out describing everything. each partner has a specialty. estate planning/elder law, criminal, liability, family. later in tgge pm the criminal lawyer meets up with my attorney. after the meeting he called a contact in the prosecutors office. the $15000 did not seem right. how do folks in the middle class have 15000 in cash laying around. turns out ex did not abandon them he was in jail. he was released 3 yrs. ago, when feds were releasing nonviolent criminals to ease overcrowding, etc. he was sure the police would be interested if he was back and practicing his profession again. but he did not have any other info but the jail time.

thursday i meet with with and fil. i asked if they minded if i recorded so there would be no misinterpretation latter. they agreed. before we started wife wanted to talk privately.  fil moved to another room. wife started to apologize. i cut her off. i said before you say anything know that i know a lot more than you think. i asked how long the sex, she said the one time. i told her the video shows that is not true. i played a clip of her dusting the tv. she never saw the camera. i know it was only a few days but she was going to lie so i was too. she thought it was part of the video game. it's not big but it is obvious on top of tv. she admitted since march almost right away! i told her no more lies! i told her of the family secret, that he was in jail not running away. she admitted to this also. i asked how long in contact, since feb. i asked if she met up anytime before him appearing she said no. i then told her he had been out for 3 years.  the look on her face told me she did not know.

we get fil back in. turn on recorder. i asked if she had a lawyer? no. told her to get one because a divorce will happen. they both asked if something along reconciliation could take place, i said no. i said i wanted the boys, she could live with ex. i told her when speaking privately that ex tried to sell me the boys. i repeated for fil. we settled on the boys could see me anytime within reason, she would not keep me from them. i said i would provide at my choosing. she would get no support. i did not want her getting the boys to ask me for things, they would be honest if i asked.

there you have it. one last thing, redditors the wife and i are avid readers of this site. we have our favorite subs. we would read and share, it was a thing we did together. she has read my post as she figured it out and she read every reply you made. she stated you ""savaged"" her. you said many things i only wish i could have because i did feel it. for that i thank you.",7
"i found a fake wells fargo account with my name on it, what next?. i was checking my credit reports and i found a wells fargo credit card opened in my name. i have never dealt with wells fargo. 

the account was open from 12/2013 to  4/2014. it had a $5000 limit, and the ""high credit"" listed on my credit report was for almost all of it. it was paid on time, and then closed.

i have a lot of questions. since it's for a closed account with payments made on time, should i report it to the credit bureaus or just leave it alone? does this mean my information has been stolen? should i file a complaint with someone, since this is probably a fake account created by wells fargo?",10
"farenheit is superior to celsius. farenheit is a better system for the use case for temperatures that 99% of the population has: temperature of the weather. it's better for two reasons:

1) the scale is far more intuitive. it's approximately 0-100, with 0 being really cold and 100 being really hot. 50 is about average. temps below 0 and above 100 are possible, but rare and extreme. that tells you everything you need to know to interpret a temperature, without having personal experience with it. conversely, the same range in celsius is -18 to 38. utterly meaningless. 

2) farenheit is 2x more precise than celsius. you would never need to use decimal or ""half"" degrees, because each degree is a small increment. this is related to #1 because the precision is scaled to about 0-100. 

if you are a scientist in a lab, having a scale from water freezing to water boiling is logical. in normal life it's meaningless and it leads to an inferior temperature measurement.

"for not paying to save ""my"" dog's life after my mom ruined its health?. when i (22f) was 11, the family dog died. i was very sad and repeatedly asked my parents to get a new one. they finally agreed, on the condition that i'd be responsible for it and take care of it. that's how i got mickey, the cutest cocker spaniel and best boy ever.

i did take care of him. i took him for a walk every day. started spending my own money to buy him food. i was so motivated with the whole dog caring thing, i even read books and magazines on how to properly educate it. they made a big point of feeding it properly and not spoiling it with human food, so i tried to stick to dog food.

but my mom (53f) would still give him ""treats"" which consisted of pretty much anything she was eating, including sweets, chocolate and cookies. throughout the years i confronted her about it but she'd just brush it off every time. i tried to buy her ""good"" treats, actual dog snacks, that she could feed him, but she continued to feed it junk.

over the years, mickey started gaining weight. he refused to eat proper dog food, eating only my mom's junk food. he also grew very attached to her, mostly because she spent all day at home with him and fed him. i was still the one taking him on walks (not once did my mom do it), playing with him at the park, but he seemed to prefer her company to mine. she'd even make snide remarks about how he'd ""chosen her as his mommy"" and ""liked her better"". this only increased my resentment towards my mom.

fast forward a few years, i had to move away for college. i reluctantly agreed to leave mickey with my parents. his health started to decline even more. my mom didn't take him out at all, and without me to control her, he grew even more obese. every time i visited i'd see the poor thing getting worse and just looking sad and it'd break my heart.

this has been going on for four years. mickey is now eleven years old, half blind and with very limited mobility. last week, he started vomiting blood. my parents took him to the vet and found it's going to need surgery to survive.

that surgery's going to cost roughly $2000. my mom doesn't have the necessary funds and asked me to cover it. i told her i can't do it. i do have the money, but it's nearly all of my savings which i need for myself. i love mickey, but i can't justify spending all my money, specially when his health is so poor and he'll probably die from something else soon anyway.

upon hearing this, my mom accused me of being heartless and ""basically killing the dog"". she said i'm the reason she bought mickey in the first place, and reminded me of my promise to care for him. i told her she's the reason he's dying, and that she's been poisoning him for years.

later my dad called, told me i'm being unfair, that even if my mom hasn't cared properly for the dog, it's wrong to let him die ""just to punish her"". the dog's life is more valuable than an ""i told you so"" to my mom. he asked me to reconsider. i still said no, but now i feel really conflicted. so reddit, aita?",3
"the argument that ""we shouldn't drink milk because no other species drinks the milk of another species other than humans"" is so stupid i can't believe people actually use it.. wanna know what else no other species does besides humans? cook, make bread, make cheese, refrigerate food, make airplanes,  and so-fucking on. a lot of research suggests that cooking meat in particular was one of the things that led to drastic cognitive development in the brain.

i ask my son if he spilled it and he said he bumped it. the girl says ""it was $5"" and looks at me expectantly. i was pissed about how rude she was and the way she was just looking at me and expecting me to pay for her mocha frappa-whatever without even asking, so i just shrugged and walked away. my partner called me an asshole when i told her the story. aita?",3
"my mum threw me through a glass door when i was a child. i have scars all over my face and body from this. i only just found out this is how i got them.. i went next door for ice-cream and when i came back mum was very angry. i remember standing on the porch waiting to get beaten then lying on the kitchen floor with blood spreading out. i was always told that the wind slammed the door into me. it never made sense on that sheltered porch though. now i don't know whether to confront my mum with it or not.

we had a very broken relationship when i was a teenager to the point of estrangement then slowly built a relationship through my twenties. now i'm 37, have 2 kids and what looks from the outside like a ""normal"" relationship with her. 

i'm pretty sure she has undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder so it's possible she will completely deny or has built a different reality of that event. 

i found out because my dad casually dropped into conversation one day what it was like to watch my mum pick me up and throw me through the door. random dad.

i am often lost in this world of pain from my past again and have a history of drugs/ alcohol/ eating disorders/ depression. i've worked very hard to get to a stable and content place with myself and finding this out has derailed me somewhat.

"ex bf tried to rape me last night. as the title says. 
he was in town and asked if he could crash at my house. i said yes. he does this sometimes. he sleeps in the spare bedroom. last night he came over and was saying how horny he was. i denied his advances. eventually it turned into me bitting, scratching and kicking him in the balls to get him off of me. i told him i'd call the police if he did manage to rape me. he was just like ""no you won't"". the whole time my dog is going crazy trying to get between us (wish she'd bit him). it ended with me getting to the kitchen and picking up a knife. which got him to stay away. i got him to go outside and i locked the door. this whole thing lasted probably 5 mins. one thing i'm proud of is fighting him off; i didn't give up. i don't plan on telling anyone about this because it's kinda extreme. i mean i pulled a knife on this guy. sorry for the jumbled up thoughts. cheers, reddit. 

*edit* 

thank you everyone so much for your kind words and support. i plan on filing a report when no one else is home (for privacy). i know as much as the next girl that without proof not much can be done. i don't live alone. i was actually surprised no one heard the fighting. i wanted to punch him but i didn't, i wanted to hurt him, but i didn't. i was embarrassed to be literally caught in that situation. so i didn't call for help. i probably didn't leave any marks on him because i wasn't trying to hurt him, i was just just trying to make him let me go and stop. i did text him later in the night and told him he was never welcome at my home again. i never plan on seeing him again. ive looked into restraining orders but they're apparently hard to get in my state without a ""reason"" (that can be proved).  i want to add that to the few that said i would be somewhat responsible if he did this to another girl and i didn't do what i'm obligated to do which is to report this and then it happen to another girl...i would feel guilty forever. one day he may have children and what if they bring a girlfriend over and he does this to her? i want everyone who's concerned about my mental well being that i'm ok. if anything i feel empowered. i won. i feel silly saying that. but i did it guys. i fought off my attacker and i won. thank you again for all the encouragement and good advice. also thank you for the tough love from some commenters.

i had moved to california a few years earlier. a few blocks away was a grocery store. in that store was a toy section. back then. 1998? it just had an assortment of coloring books and some ""squeaky"" toys. rubber animals you would squeeze to make a noise. i would grab the ""squeak"" thing from those toys. they are the size of a pill or vitamin. if i placed it in my mouth and pulled it to the back i could talk while making a stupid noise. one time heading back to my friends after grabbing a fresh squeaker i accidentally chortle\ snorted and inhaled the thing. i'm behind the store now ready to hop the stone wall back home. no one is around. nor will there be til the trash is dropped at end of night. so i'm choking. but instead of a gasp its a loud squeak. reeeeeet, ruuuuuh. i'm grasping at my chest. reereet, ruuuh. my vision fades and a fall down on my back. this dislodges the squeaker with one more loud reet. after a moment on the ground i get up and go home. deciding i'll never take a squeaker again.

"for not trading seats on a plane?. this happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought i was a bit rude, but i thought i was completely justified.

when we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he's very proud of it. then he asked if i could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. i was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. i honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. so we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" i answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


as i said my girlfriend said i was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

"update re: i might be kicking the bucket, what do i need to do for my wife here?. short version: faced with mortality i wanted to do everything i could do for my wife. my previous assumptions about the transfer of property were wrong and would have caused my wife a lot of undue stress. i'll be taking steps to ensure she has immediate access to everything as well as legal documents to support her as needed. 


freakin novella:

so a couple weeks ago i received some fairly ambiguous and uncomfortable news that caused me to really think about the state i'd be leaving my beloved wife in if i were to die. original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8co3an/i_might_be_kicking_the_bucket_what_do_i_need_to/)  

it felt great to know that her promising career and our financial position would carry her through the worst case scenario, but i also identified a number of of things that i should address and i believe they may apply to some of you. it's become a bit of a stereotype that only fiscal nerds and the elderly need to be concerned with stuff like this, but i'm a reasonably healthy 28 year old that just left the army and i spent the last two weeks scrambling to deal with this stuff because of a random blob on an mri. 

**first thing is first, i'm not an attorney or finance professional and this is just stuff that i've observed throughout this process. please feel free to speak up if you disagree with whatever follows; i'd definitely appreciate making sure i'm doing everything i can do here.** 


**1.** the first thing that i did after leaving the doctor's office was drive to a lawyer's. it might seem unnecessary and like a waste of money, but i'm glad i did and i wish i had gone sooner. i'm fortunate enough to have access to ""free"" legal services by virtue of being on active duty; however, i would have happily paid to know that i'm preventing my wife from taking on additional hardship during what would likely be a very already difficult time in her life. even if you don't have a medical concern, i still strongly recommend doing it because shit happens. a lawyer may also save you from the ramblings of a random man on the internet. 

**1.a.** i, stupidly, believed i understood the way things worked. i thought my wife would inherit everything because she's my wife, right? what's mine is hers, as we often see with posts about brutal divorces, and our situation is very simple (only one beneficiary, no crazy property stuff, etc.). what i didn't consider about that reasoning was that divorce is usually a drawn out legal process under the best of terms. i had wrongly assumed that joint ownership was sort of inferred by virtue of our marriage. my wife almost certainly would have gained access to all my assets, but only after having dealt with a lengthy legal process and piles of paperwork (that shit takes 18 months in virginia). it makes me ridiculously sad, and upset with myself, to think of my wife dealing with all that stress in the midst of such a traumatic time because she married an idiot know-it-all. 

**2.** my first step toward making life easy on her was making sure she had easy access to my (our) money. we've kept our finances separated because we feel it's a wise choice for newlyweds. i still feel this way; however, our circumstances have changed and i was unwilling to leave her exposed to the risk of the aforementioned stress.  there were three options here: handle it using a ""last will and testament,"" add her to my account, or set up a ""payment upon death."" i'll get into the will thing a little later, but i didn't like it for this situation and my intent. instead, i chose to add her to the account because she would have (actually has) direct and immediate access to those accounts without dealing with any bureaucracy. the last option is sort of a middle-ground between all the other steps. ""payment upon death"" is a way of telling you bank to give all your stuff to someone when you die. this offers protection from the risks of a joint account while circumventing lengthy administrative processes; however, i didn't like the idea of my wife having to prove to some strangers that i was dead. i'm sure this wouldn't be too unreasonable of a process, but i just saw it as another burden for her to deal with as she worked through everything.

**3.** the next step was making sure she had access to the investments i made. this was easy because i'm behind a lot of you and only have holdings in a few mutual funds.  those holdings are linked to my banking accounts and i've left my wife with a detailed explanation of what they are and how to deal with them, sell them, etc. i also explained the order in which i believe she should sell them and the scenarios that would justify doing so. 

**4.** the final asset to worry about was my car. if the worst happens and my death is inevitable, i'll trade in both of our cars so that she can have one brand new one and remove one more potential stress factor during that time. for now, i'm just working on adding her as a joint owner so that she has more control (as with the bank account) and won't be subject to the bureaucracy i keep mentioning. 

**5.** the ""silver bullet"" for addressing any of my oversights in preparation for my wife having to deal with all my assets during this process is a general durable power of attorney. there's a huge amount of risk exposure here, as with joint bank accounts, because this allows someone to legally act on your behalf. i can't begin to tell you how many guys i've watched meltdown afghanistan because their wife took everything and divorced them using that power of attorney. that being said, i have complete faith in my wife and you can also set these up to have a limited scope or scale (e.g. timeframe, what it applies to, etc.). mine will also be secured in a safety deposit box with other key documents that she'll be able to access if i die. 

**6.** my last main effort has been compiling a massive document of everything. this document will also be in the safety deposit box and will contain login information for literally everything (bank stuff, credit cards, utilities, car loan, computers, social media, netflix, etc.). it also contains details on how and when various bills are paid, where spare keys for the cars are, the type of oil her car needs, the order in which to sell investments, advice on financially moving forward (you guys make an appearance), approximate values for any of my stuff that happens to be valuable so that she doesn't get taken advantage of, contact information for the attorney, etc.  this is literally just a giant pile of everything, almost like a reference book for me. my intent here was to provide her with more information than necessary because i don't want her to deal with the stress of something working through netflix password recovery when she moves. 

**7.** i previously mentioned that a ""last will and testament"" wasn't ideal for my circumstances. the truth is, relying solely on one would have done a shitty job of fulfilling my intent here. i don't have a lot of stuff and i want my wife to have everything, so some massive undertaking isn't necessary to ensure the proper transfer of my ""estate."" these documents certainly have their purpose, but in my case this document was only slightly better than relying on community property laws and probate. the common expectation, at least in my experience, is that the bereaved sit down in an office with lots of hardwood and leather-bound books while a stuffy man with a stack of paper quickly takes care of the rest. after speaking with an attorney, this really didn't seem to be the case. i ended up having one drawn up to serve as a tertiary contingency plan in the event that this somehow becomes what is best for my wife, but i really didn't like it and hope she won't rely on it because my previous steps were effective.

**8.** the last thing i did was an advanced medical directive. in the interest of saving my wife from having to deal with the reality of deciding whether or not i should die i went ahead and did it myself. i outlined the criteria for which medical staff will have to follow and i set limits on what i was comfortable with with regard to prolonging my life. this in and of itself was worth the trip because i know the scenario that this could apply to would tear my wife apart.  



so, all that being said- is there anything else i can do here?

"when i was 21, nobody showed up to my birthday party at the bar that i rented out. first off, i'm a guy and i still think about this today and it makes me cringe inside thinking about it. it was sort of a low point for me personally and it makes me wary of the choices i make moving forward.

**backstory:**

back when i was 20, i was pretty popular or so i thought, i had big groups of friends but not one best friend. i had what i thought great relationships with people and i was the type of guy to be there for you. i was always going out to friends birthdays, meet ups and seeing them before they'd go out to college etc. basically, i was a stand out guy and was loyal to the bone. if you needed me to pick you up out of jail at 2 in the morning, i was the guy to call, i had your back.

**story about the night:**

that night, i had reservations from a friend who knew the bar owner, they had their own personal bar in the back and they told me i could rent it out for free. i thought great, this room is pretty big and has enough tables to sit about 35 people. i had personally invited 30-40 people a week prior and was excited about the aspect of seeing all of my friends and just getting completely wasted with them. party was to start at 10 so i decided it's probably a good idea to get there a little late to make an entrance. 

around 10:30 i get there, music is blasting but the backroom is completely empty. the bartender asks me where my friends are at and i told them they all must be running late, trying to laugh it off with her. i stood by the bar staring at my phone, i got a couple of texts from people saying they'd be late or cancelling last minute. around 11:30 rolls around, still nobody and i can see the bartender feeling bad for me, offering me free drinks throughout the night. i felt completely embarrassed and stupid just standing there alone on my birthday thinking i had all these great friends. around 12:30, still nobody, not one person has texted me since, so around 1:15 i tell them forget it i'm going home. the bartender put her hand on my shoulder and told me to forget them and know who my real friends are. i held back my tears standing in that dark empty room, feeling drunk and completely humiliated. so many mixed emotions went through my head but mostly embarrassed and betrayed. i went outside and called a cab and cried in the back on my way home. i got to my place and just sat on the bathroom floor for an hour that night, crying my eyes out like a little kid. friends asked me about my birthday the following day but i didn't even respond to them.

i've gotten over it because i'm 26 now. its still a hard thing to think about and muster. it's really effected the way i've chosen friends to keep close, my trust in people's words have been completely broken unless they've been able to prove otherwise. i really don't expect anything out of anyone, and when they do i'm really caught off guard. it's something i hope nobody ever has to go through. 

i've never felt more alone then that night.

**tldr- invited tons of friends to my 21st birthday party, not one person shows up.**

edit. i didn't think i'd be getting this sort of response. i'll try to respond individually if i can, stuck at work at the moment. i'm reading all your comments, i'm sorry to all the people that this happened to because honestly, it's one of the most gut wrenching feelings to go through.

take it from someone who has continuously fallen so much, the ground has became my home. as cliche as it sounds: **do not give up!! keep pushing!! keep climbing!! find amazing mentors, work hard and surround yourself with positive people and the world will be your oyster. you will get there.**

**the majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

the _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. examples:

* let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. cool; **zero stars.** shoot i might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* together but your s/o cheated on you once? most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. great; **one or two stars.**

* married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. awesome; **two, maybe even three stars.**

* good relationship with your s/o but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(this&nbsp;is&nbsp;uncommon.)_

* everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? probably **four to five stars.**^^_(this&nbsp;is&nbsp;uncommon.)_

this applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a tldr for the tldr, i'm avoiding listing every single condition. you get the idea.

basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" if everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

you get the drift? 

---

##tl;dr: 

the vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. it's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. the more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

yeah, this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub's been around for almost a decade. it's also long overdue considering we're at over 1.3m subs and y'all are always so grim. shrug. ~~***comments open for 72 hours or less,***~~ edit: which is to say that we'll take feedback on this and whether there _should_ be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give... but honestly, we'd rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason. if you disagree with a downer, just downvote it.

"i have a micropenis.. remorse: if you feel bad 

i have a micropenis. my penis is about 2.5"" erect. i've never told anyone about it. i don't want anyone to know. they will think that i am less of a man. at the very least they will pity me, which is even worse.

i'm not overweight or anything like that, it's just the way it is. i'm a virgin, never done anything with a girl. i'm average in terms of looks. i'm short but girls show interest occasionally/rarely. i'm scared to do anything. i'm 19 and in college, so everyone around me is having sex all the time and i have to just feign laughter as guys tell me that they ""fucked this really hot girl last night."" it's great. i've known that my penis was small since i was 13/14, but i assumed that it would grow eventually. it didn't.

i've read just about every single article, study and forum post about micropenises and the consensus is that women don't get pleasure from penetrative sex at all. in movies you see the two main characters get together and it's very romantic, they kiss and start to have sex, they're both moaning and loving it. it seriously breaks my heart to know that i'll never be able to give a woman that experience. i know that i can learn to give cunnilingus (and i've read a lot on the topic), but it's just not the same. women talk about being ""filled up"" like its the most amazing feeling in the world. it hurts to know that i can't provide that feeling. i've tried to kill myself before. i broke into a building and was standing on the roof about to jump, but i just couldn't do it. i stayed there for hours trying to find the balls to do it, but apparently they're small too.

i hate it so much. the thought of a woman laughing at me when the clothes come off is terrifying. very few women would accept a man with a micropenis and even if there was a woman who could she would always think about a guy who was larger. penetrative sex is off the table so she would probably seek it elsewhere. i know i probably sound like a whiny little bitch, and i most likely am, but it just really fucking sucks.

**edit**: i apologize for the fragmented writing, my thoughts are quite jumbled.

**edit2**: thanks for all of the replies. people are misquoting and misunderstanding the things that i say, so i'm pretty much done commenting. i realise that when something like this is posted, all the magical optimistic fairies come in and say that the world is a beautiful place. but thinking that the majority of women are going to be okay with a 2.5"" penis is delusional. genuinely delusional. especially 19 year olds.

i may have exaggerated by saying that it is one of the main elements of masculinity. when i said it i was mainly referring to height. which many studies support. 

are there some who will accept it, absolutely. i guess, i just need to find them.

oh, and thanks for the 9 months of gold. this is a throw away, so it's kind of a waste though.",12
"my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue.. i honestly don't know what happened. a couple of days ago, my girlfriend who i lived with left our apartment while i was at work, claimed to her family and mutual friends that i'd been physically abusing her, and blocked me on everything. i have no idea what's going on. there weren't any major problems in our relationship that i could see, and we just had consensual sex last night. the very last time i spoke to her before all of this happened, she was perfectly fine, kissed me goodbye before i went to work, and everything was normal.

then i got a call from my dad toward the end of the day asking me calmly if i've been hitting my girlfriend. i didn't know what he was talking about, and then she told me.

i rushed home, and she had gotten all of her stuff and is staying either with her family, or a friend of hers. my facebook account is blowing up, and i have no idea what to do.

none of what is being said is true, and i don't know if someone is just playing a cruel joke on me. a few people even mentioned that the police were called, but i haven't heard anything as of yet.

the last major argument we had was probably in february around valentine's day. we were going through some financial trouble, the stress got to us, and we were both getting upset with each other over petty, household things. she was my best friend, the person i could rely on to be there for me, and the person i would be there for always, no matter what. we were definitely planning on getting married. it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. her family had basically accepted me into the family. i was close with both her mom and her dad. i only called them both once each -- neither of them answered my calls. i called my, i don't know, ex? just twice. no answer. she blocked me on every social media platform of hers that i know of. i asked a couple of friends, but they are being distant with me -- just one word answers, or ghosting me.

what the fuck is happening here? we'd always been up front and honest with each other, and our communication was stellar.

tl;dr: i guess my girlfriend decided she wasn't happy in the relationship or something, and instead of breaking up with me, she left behind my back completely out of the blue, and claimed to everyone that i've been physically abusing her. i have no idea what's going on.",7

"for never telling my son about the existance of his twin brother. my 4 year old son jon is the one of the twins i had. my other son was mishandled by a nurse and passed away shortly after birth, it was an unfortunate accident. 


me and my husband left our unnamed son with the hospital and did not press charges against the nurse, much to our parents'(both his and mine) displeasure. our reason was that we had no time nor energy to deal with them, our priority was to look after jon, who was much smaller than his twin and needed more attention.


while growing up, despite never being mentioned, jon seemed to know that he once had a brother. he told us his made-up stories that he had about brothers, he played roles about brothers with his toys, and he even asked us to give him an older brother.


initially, me and my husband made a promise that we would never tell jon about his unnamed brother, but now he wants to tell jon about it when he is older. it must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. 


i am still still standing firm to our promise. i believe that we should not dwell on the past and move on. jon is my son and my little bundle of joy, i would never want him to know the sorrow of losing his brother. i want to convince him that his brother is just a fragment of his imagination.


now both my parents, my husband's parents and my husband is calling me cold blooded. they want so much to included a deceased brother into jon's life. he is still little, so it wouldn't be now, but they intended to tell him one day and i cannot stop them. however, i will still try to convince them while there is  time, he needs no such negativity from the past.


for thinking this way?

"june goal: do not buy breakfast or lunch out!. me: 31/f, fully employed, $3,145 net take home each month

i have been slowly working my way out of credit card debt for the past three years. with a little over one year of payments left to go on my $20k debt consolidation loan, i can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

with that, i have been closely monitoring where my money has been going this year. i am very good about tracking how my money is distributed (bills, rent, loan payments, etc) but have never been good about tracking what i have been spending my money on. in looking at my spending habits in january, february, march, april, and now may i have confirmed what i already knew in my head... i spend a shit ton of money eating out. in january, i spent $400 eating out on just breakfast (coffee) and lunches alone. in february, close to $500. same goes for march and april. i was way down in may because i made a conscious effort to not eat out so that i could save up for a trip i took. it helped a lot.

i took a look at my calendar and found that i miraculously have one lunch appointment on the calendar and no breakfast appointments in june. this means i have an opportunity to save money by eating breakfast at home and packing my lunch every day. 

i know this seems so simple but i haven't always been good about this. my work culture is such that people eat out a lot, i meet with people over coffee or lunches frequently, and so on. some of that i get reimbursed but a lot of it is just eating out with coworkers. i live in a mid-sized city, so lunches cost anywhere from $10-18/lunch. not terrible, but like many of you know, that adds up!

i'm excited to challenge myself this month and hopefully save a butt load of money. this money could be better spent either in savings account (that's dismal right now) or paying off loans. 

thanks for reading. i really feel like i am starting to make a turn in how i manage money and am so looking forward to financial freedom in the very near future. my june goal to not eat breakfast or lunches out will help give me the boost i need and hopefully, become a habit of mine.

**edit (6/1, 8:40am est):** 
wow! i wasn't quite expecting that type of response! a couple of things i learned from you.

* scaling back or cutting the number of meals you eat out can make a big difference financially.  
* it can also make a difference health-wise!  
* it's important to be strategic about when you eat out, especially when it comes to work and colleagues. even though you aren't going out and buying lunch, don't exclude yourself from group situations if possible.  
* when meal planning, variety is key. some of you mentioned getting bored with the meals you were making at home and as a result, would slip up and buy food.  
* r/mealprepsunday was mentioned several times as a resource for planning.  
* really examine why you're in debt to begin with. and once you pay off that debt, consider investing the money you no longer are using to pay down debt. your future self with thank you!  
* more than anything, it's about having realistic goals and making sure you aren't setting yourself up for failure. 

i very much enjoyed reading all of your responses, tips, and well-wishes! it has given me great motivation for today - day 1! for breakfast i had cheerios at home. i packed myself a lunch and headed to work where i am now sipping a free hazelnut coffee. 

i look forward to catching up with you all at the end of the month. for my own purposes, i will be keeping a daily log of what i spend (including non-food related items), what i meal prep and eat, and what noticeable changes i see. i've never had a ""blog"" so to speak, but i might consider starting one so i can share all of this with you later this month. any suggestions you have for sites would be most helpful!

"for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?. just as a little background, i grew up in a very strict christian family where i wasn't allowed to cut my hair, ever, because ""hair is a woman's crown"". it was down to my knees by the time i escaped at 18. ever since then i've either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because i cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. so that's a big reason i'm so stubborn about this issue. also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. right now i'm bald because i always shave my head completely for the summer. 

one of my good friends is getting married in august and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. everything had been cool, she's always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if i could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. she explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. i told her i really didn't want to get a wig, and we've been on bad terms ever since.

all of our friends are on her side because ""it's just a wig"" and ""it's not like she's asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she's not the one being unreasonable."" and i know i can be very stubborn sometimes, which i guess is the reason i'm posting here. 

the thing is, i don't know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. i've already paid for a bridesmaid's dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who's going to do our makeup. this wedding has already cost me a fortune. i could afford a wig if i wanted to, but do i really want to spend the money on something i'll never wear again when i've already spent a ton? not really.

also, this is going to be on a plantation in louisiana. in august. i'm already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. 

my biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying i'm the asshole-is the principle of the thing. i feel like it implies i look bad because i don't have hair, which i personally don't think is true. is being bald so hideous i'll ruin her pictures? is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? and i think the ""i want us to match"" thing is stupid. we're already wearing matching dresses, why isn't that enough? i know it's ""her day"" and we're supposed to make her happy, but isn't there a line? 

i've offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she's not having it. i'm still in the bridal party and invited but i don't know for how much longer, honestly. for not wanting to wear a wig?

edit: just to add two things: 1. she's not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. along with the headscarf i'd also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of august so it'd still be really short though.",3

"my friends house was stolen oh. location: ohio

hello,

i am writing this on behalf of my friend and co-worker who is fully aware i am posting this.  below is a description of the situation, taken and edited for privacy, from a post he made alerting his friends and family of what has happened.

>my husband and i were recently paid a visit last month by someone claiming to own our home. ""i'm sorry..this is going to sound really crazy and i know you have lived here a long time, but i own this house."" which just happens to be the home we purchased 8 years ago and where our family have been living and paying our mortgage. i immediately asked him to leave our property and contacted our local police department while he angrily began taking pictures of our house and vehicle in the driveway. to my surprise when i searched our county auditor's web page, there were indeed two transfers made in july of this year. we were never made aware of or signed any transfer of ownership. when i contacted our mortgage company to whom we make payments, they were not aware of any title changes either but they did make it clear that we are still responsible to make all of our mortgage payments.  
>  
>we made a trip to our county records department but no one could answer how our home was seemingly purchased right out from under us and the deeds transferred without us or the mortgage bank being involved. the department head and supervisor at the records department were just as baffled as we were.  the previous owner who sold us the home is deceased and the original lender is no longer in business. we then received legal council and filed a police report last month due to multiple very aggressive attempts to gain access to our home by a man claiming to represent the ""current owners.""  apparently, our house should never have been sold to us and has recently been sold right out from underneath us. we were advised to submit a title insurance claim and begin preparations to move.  
>  
>we found out that there was a case that involved our house and the ""detroit fire and police pension property scam"" out of michigan. that case opened in 2008 and the final judgement was made 4 years later. we purchased our home using a ""survivorship warranty deed"" with what we assumed was a clean title, but we were wrong.   we have requested that the corporation evict our family and not return to our home again.  fortunately, no one has returned since.  we were alarmed when the supposed ""new owners"" received their first piece of mail at our residence which happened to be a water bill. they have made yet another transfer without notice.  i got in contact with the water company only to get an apologetic, ""i am sorry mrs. #####., only the owners can change it back and we can not give you any balance or account information.""

while they have sought legal counsel, they are desperately seeking any additional information they can get regarding this situation.  everyone they speak with seems baffled by what has happened.   i will run all questions through him before responding for complete accuracy.",2

i confronted him. i asked if he had ever been unfaithful. he looked like he was about to say no then he admitted four women and the nanny. two were in a city he travels to frequently. one was a one night stand on a trip. and one was local. all told, he had a mistress for about seven of the thirteen years we were married. i can't imagine what the women went through. if they didn't know he was married, then they were victims. if they did know, then i hope they find peace from whatever demon caused them to sleep with a married man.  


i think i could've stayed with him if it had just been the women. maybe, i can't say for sure. but the nanny was a violation of trust and an act of a troubled man. she had to fear for her job. i can't blame her in any way, and i'll reach out to her when the time is right to make sure again she knows she's loved.  


the kids cried when we told them. he's at an airbnb until he can find more permanent housing. i'll stay here with the kids. the current nanny is moving in for the foreseeable future and my mother is coming to help. we'll all be ok.   


i did want to say one last thing. there were those who came into the original thread with hatred in their heart towards my husband's accuser. i looked at the place you came from, and it's vile and hurtful. i hope whatever pain in your life, current or past, that caused you to spew such hatred is exorcised and you find peace and love. always look for the good in people and forgive their trespasses as you are forgiven yours.",7
"is the japanese surgical/dust mask trend actually helping lower the % of people getting sick over there?. have there been actual studies? or how about just comparing their infection vs population rates to begin with?

**edit:** so far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. they prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. they prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

sounds good to me. 

so yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

why do you do this to me. why. do you know what you're doing? every time you come into my office and sit across from me and cross and recross your legs and talk about the weather and then (somehow) about how unemployment insurance is actually bad for poor people do you know that i'm wondering if your panties are equally as conservative? that i'm curious what you'd look like on top of me, my hands tweaking your nipples like doing so would be tweaking taxes on the top one percent? that i'm thinking about you looking back at me as i fuck you from behind, your jesus necklace swaying back and forth as you scream ""drill, baby, drill!""

you're not crazy, just politically hypocritical. social conservatism is selfish and untenable. your adherence to laws written when people owned slaves and the largest city was 1/10th of what it is now is ruining this god damn country. and i want you so bad. i want you so so bad. 

ugh. be my monica lewinsky. i'll be your bill clinton. let's reach across the aisle... and into each other's pants. ",11
"oh my god pedicures. holy hell. my feet are in a state of bliss. i'm a dude and not afraid to admit i always thought pedicures were super feminine. my wife has encouraged me to get one for years and today i finally relented. 

my feet are as smooth as a baby's bottom, i sat in a massage chair and soaked my lower digits in a hot tub, and i'll be damned if my toes don't look dainty as fuck.

"by ruining my valentine's date with my girlfriend. so my girl and i had a great night planned. i made reservations at her favorite restaurant. she got a sexy little number to wear for ""after dinner"" and sent me teasing texts all day. she absolutely loved the flowers i got her, and she presented me with a bouquet of homemade beef jerky. she then proceeded to spend, i kid you not, 3 hours getting ready.  she looked friggin' amazing though. we were both starving and she was really looking forward to a night out. 

so we get to the restaurant and get seated. the only menu they give us is this valentine's day special. i do some quick mental math and realize *this dinner is going to cost me close to $300.* 

oh. hell. no. 

so my gf looks up from the wine list and sees i am antsy. she asks what's wrong. i mumble something about their prices having gone up. she asked if i wanted to go somewhere else and i jumped on it. practically raced out of there. she followed along and sheepishly made excuses to the wait staff. 

so we get back to the car and i apologized and told her $300 was ridiculous for one dinner and she was like ""wait? what? it wasn't that much"" 

turns out the menu prices were *per couple* not per person like i had thought. 

once i realized that dinner would in fact have been in my budget. i tried to get her to go back to the restaurant. this is where i *really* fucked up. she kept saying no and that she didn't want to. she said she would be too embarassed to go back. i said that was ridiculous and i didn't understand why and i kept trying to get her to go back. then she suddenly burst into tears and sobs ""why. aren't. you. listening? it doesn't matter why all that matters is that it does. why do you want to push me into something that makes me feel so uncomfortable?""

ah fuck. she kinda had a point. i apologize and drive her home. i asked if she wanted to go to any of the other restaurants on our route home. she said no since she ""looked like shit"" since her make up got all messed up from crying. (she didn't. she still looked gorgeous) 

we get home and i don't think anyone on the face of the planet has ever gotten changed from fancy clothes to sweats as fast as she did. i tried apologizing again, she said it was ok but she just wanted to be alone for a while. 

now she and the cat are in the other room watching true crime documentaries. 

tl;dr i ruined date night by thinking the restaurant was over priced and leaving (it wasn't) then not listening to her. now girlfriend and cat are probably plotting how to get away with my murder.

edit: just to clear up some confusion from the way i worded it. dinner was not $150 per person. they were doing a v day special where for $150 you got dinner, dessert, champagne and flowers for 2. 

edit 2: wow! i can't believe how this blew up! thanks everyone! of course my first reddit gold is on a throw away. lol but thank you! 
also... fuck. girlfriend has indeed found this post. i got a ""did you post about last night on reddit?"" text from her this morning.

"""nutritionists"",""nutritional therapists"", ""holistic nutritionist"", or ""nutritional coaches"" don't require any formal certification, education or training to use those titles. ""dieticians"" do require it. be careful who you accept diet & nutrition advice from.. **edit** 
important note to this. only registered dietitians or rdns (registered dietician nutritionists) are technically certified to diagnose & treat food/nutrition related illnesses, diseases, & conditions such as eating disorders & deficiencies. 

1) some or most people might spell it dietitian, not dietician. unsure if one is correct or if its just regional.


2) ymmv. certain countries or states likely have different regulations on this. afaik in  most parts of the us and uk, nutritionists *can* get some sort of certification and higher ed training, but its not generally required, and its not as regulated as a dietitian or registered dietitian.  in almost all cases, anything like ""diet coach"" or ""nutrition coach"" or ""heath coach"" or ""nutritional specialist"" are bs terms. main takeaway from this lpt is do your research on your own country or state's rules, and be careful who you trust.


3) i'm not intending to imply that there aren't any nutritionists with 4 year degrees, graduate degrees, or proper training. just saying rigorous education & certification is not always required, unlike dietitian, which is a regulated & protected term almost universally. i'm sure there are some great, knowledgeable nutritionists and nutritional therapists out there...and some terrible quack dietitians. again, do your research and be careful who you trust.

"purchased a laptop from a guy on craigslist and found cp on it. i am being told that calling the police is a bad idea because i am the one in posession of it.. basically the title. bought the laptop from the dude at his home in his drive way. after 2 hours i found the cp on it and shut it down immediately. i wanted to call the police but i am being told that that is a terrible idea as the texas law regarding it is stupid as fuck. they said that i would be the one charged as i am the one in possession of it and that the creator of it would face separate charges. 

am i going to have to get an attorney for this or is there a way i can report this without one? i am pretty broke and can not afford even 100s for a consultation fee. 

is my friend right in that i would be fucked if i called the police?

edit: i just got back from the police. i am not going to provide many details here other than i am not in trouble, so far, and that i only gave information about how long i had the laptop, how long it was before i found the cp, and handed over copies of all documentation. i had my old cell phone on me and recorded the audio of what happened on it for cya. 

i was tempted to just wipe the device when i first found it as i felt like i did not want to lose the 200 i paid for it. yes selfish i know but at that point i did not care. my conscience got the better of me though. the police have it now and i have records of everything in case they decide to bust down my door over this.

"it took 24 years, but i finally kissed the girl i had a crush on in grade 11.. she was one of those popular girls in high school.  heck, she was better than those popular girls at school because she never gossiped or said anything bad about anyone to anyone.   she was nice to me, always said hello to me, always smiled.  she was the one all the boys wanted.  i helped her out once on a school project and as a thank you she took me out to dinner when she was driving me home (she had a license and i didn't!).  i had such a crush on her.  

&nbsp;

what shot did a nerdy (my mom still bought my clothes for me at 16!) bookworm like me have with a popular girl like her?  even though i knew she'd say no, i don't think i could have dealt with the rejection so i never tried asking her out.  after high school, i would run into her occasionally at the clubs and sometimes when visiting friends at her school (we went to different colleges in town).  and that was pretty much it, after i graduated i didn't see her at all and she passed into memory.

&nbsp;

fast forward to this year. i've changed quite a bit obviously, more confident and comfortable in my skin as all adults should be by now (although ironically, i'm posting this with a throwaway).  she popped up on my recommended friends list on facebook so i added her.  we started chatting, catching up on what happened to the both of us after high school and made plans to meet up for dinner to catch up in person.

&nbsp;

meeting up at dinner, she still looked every bit as beautiful as the day i met her.  still the same pinball smile and bright eyes that all made my heart skip a beat everytime she looked my way in highschool.  she told me that she had always found me nicer than the other boys at school and really cute and smart.  i admitted to her that i had a huge crush on her all throughout high school.  she acted surprised and asked me why i didn't ask her out if i had a crush.  a little part of me died knowing that i actually had a shot with her back then.  dinner was wonderful and we went out to a pub for a quick evening drink and made plans to meet up again on the weekend.

&nbsp;

and then as we were walking back to our vehicles, we stopped and said goodnight and we finally kissed.  16 year old me would be so proud.",11

"psa - parents don't be afraid to educate or explain your financial situation to your kids, particularly as you both get older. i think financial education is a great thing at any age, but i can appreciate talking about finances - especially family details - can be a sticky, tricky topic.  we are often taught that money isn't an appropriate subject, and that may be true in many cases.  however, i see multiple posts on reddit about people asking for advice on how to deal with their parent's situation and i've learned from what happened to us as well ...

my dad died suddenly at age 66.  he was always good with money and we lived comfortably and somewhat frugally.  as my parents got older, i tried gently prodding financial insights from them - did they have life insurance, are all the bills covered, does my mom get dad's pension if he goes first.  my dad was never comfortable discussing any of these things.  when he died, my mom was clueless, and everything was left to me to figure out.  clearly my dad should have talked to her, if not to me, but i was in a much better position to deal with everything even though i had to figure out the information with nothing to go on.

this morning my husband's single mom calls us in tears saying that she can't travel to visit us this year because she is broke.  my husband grew up relatively poor, but she had married a few times in her 50s and was actually given a $250k settlement from her ex-husband, about 3 years ago.  somehow she has blown through this and doesn't earn enough from ss to cover her basic bills.  if she had only talked to us when she got that settlement i could have helped her plan a way to make it last - we had no idea she received this money nor that she was living so close to the edge.

too little, too late in both these situations and yet, my husband and i are being called in to help.  death is inevitable, money is necessary, i wish my family had not felt these were taboo topics until it was too late.

edit:  well this blew up ... as many have realized, yes, i was talking about adult children in particular based on the experiences of myself, friends and colleagues being unpleasantly surprised by parental circumstances and then not being in a position to do anything about it.  of course, as a parent, use your discretion on kids of any age - still lessons to be learned, just not in the ways many have described below.",10
"so i (22m) went on a date. the most degrading, humiliating moment of my entire life.. i met a woman on a dating app she said she wasn't looking for a hookup just looking for someone to hang out with i asked her in so many words if she meant strictly platonic and she said we'll see. okay great i drive 45 minutes to her house i get lost and  i call her up, ""hey can you get me cigareeetteeeesssss"" yeah so i show up at her house she hugs me we go inside and sit on the couch and for a solid 10 minutes she lectures me on how it was wrong that i asked her if she was open to sex then she told me how she has 2 kids taken by the state in california and one autistic kid that would be coming home in 2 hrs.. we watched a movie i tried sitting closer to her and she freaked out and lectured me about personal space and boundaries (this is date? i cant sit next to you?!?!?) the movie finished and i asked her if i should leave so it wouldnt be awkward for her kid... she said no it would be fine if i stayed then she said she was thinking about getting pizza and she asked me to go pick it up (pick it up) but i ended up buying 40$ worth of pizza and beer for this psycho... the kid came home we ate the pizza we sat on the couch the kid used me as a jungle gym while she texted other guys for about 4 hrs i was about to get a beer (i paid for) when she grabbed it out of my hand she said ""im gonna get drunk off those and you have to drive home soon"" 1hr later when the last movie ended she said ""im going to bed you have to leave"" i got up and sprinted out the door havent talked to her since now im laying on the floor in my bedroom which has no furniture in it balling my eyes out because im so lonely and people are just going to take advantage of me.

"i put a ladybug out in almost freezing temperatures and left it. i know this is stupid but i don't really know why this is hitting me so hard. 

last night i was sitting in my room when something moved out of the corner of my eye. i flinched at first because i thought it was a bug, but i realized it was a ladybug which i've always loved. it was below freezing and i knew he came in for warmth, but i knew he would starve if he stayed in forever, so i decided to let him stay in my room for the night in a container with a little bit of water, and i would release him the following morning.

well.. right now is the following morning. i woke up and he was in a different spot than when i went to sleep so i knew he was walking around looking for something to do, i knew it was time to release him since it's just about the warmest it'll be all day, but it's still almost freezing. i felt sad as i picked up his container and carried it outside, but like i said i knew he would starve to death for sure if he stayed inside, and i didn't want to interfere with nature's course that much anyways so i knew he had to go. 

i went outside and found a little tree and some soil to put him by and let him crawl out into it. i stood up and looked at him and he was so small and he was walking around, and instantly i felt like crying. i'm a 22 year old man and i had to cut myself off from looking at him because i thought i was about to cry outside in public. i got back to my room and i started crying, just the image of how small he was, alone and probably cold and hungry and how i had to turn my back on him.

i don't know why i feel so bad. i believe in my logical reasons for having to release him, but i can't help but think, what if i could keep him inside and warm and well fed and stuff. i don't know. like i said i know this is dumb but i kinda just had to vent. thank you

edit: wow, i didn't expect anything like this kind of response. i wrote this 14 hours ago on this alternate account of mine, and just now i was browsing the home page of reddit on my main account and came across a post on this subreddit about a ladybug with 2.8k upvotes, over a hundred comments, and gold/silver, it took me a moment to realize it was my own and i'm completely blown away. there's so much support, advice, and just general thoughts put into all these comments and pm's that i don't even know where to begin. 

from what i've learned in this thread and some personal research, ladybugs are more resilient to the cold than i initially thought and have numerous methods for coping with it - obviously not all of them survive but there's at least the hope that he's okay. even if he doesn't, a lot of direction was given regarding dealing with that possibility. i, and from the looks of it most of you, want him to survive, but all of it is honestly just nature's process and in the end there's only so much we can, or should, do. it still saddens me, the image of that small, lonely ladybug against the elements as i got up to walk away, but i'm much more accepting of it now.

i appreciate all of the kind words and thoughts put into this little venting session of mine. i would love to reply to each and every one of you but i hope this edit and a few replies can show how much it means to me, i've read through all of your replies and they are all appreciated. thank you all so much. i hope at the very least this can spread the positives of empathy and bring a little more care to people's hearts.",11
"people shouldn't complain about privacy while they at the same time share everything about their life on social media.. i had a discussion with a co-worker today. we talked about surveillants. i thought that london and places in japan did the right thing by installing a bunch of cameras around the cities. it has prevented and solved a lot of crimes. he didn't agree. he said that he wanted his privacy. he went on and on about the huge privacy issues we have today. like how the government scans and reads our emails and yada yada. i simply asked him ""if privacy is so important to you, how come you share everything about your life on social media? you upload photos of yourself, your kids and your wife. you have your house and address online. you share your work and expensive stuff you own. how come you're so concerned about privacy when you're giving 100% away every day?"". he didn't have an answer for that at all.

i get that you want privacy regarding money, bank information, and other personal stuff. but other than that, what do you have left to protect by not installing cameras everywhere?",6
"i am not proud of my son.. this saturday, my son will have been sober for 18 months.  he got his ged this year, and he starts at community college at the end of august.  he finally has a job that i didn't get for him, soon he will be moving into his own apartment, and he hasn't missed a single appointment with his therapist.  he has done everything you would expect of a precocious 17-year-old who hit a rough patch after meeting with a particularly bad influence.

 he is 29.

this is the point where i'm supposed to say that, nevertheless, i'm *still* proud of him for turning his life around, getting off drugs and off the streets, staying out of trouble, and acting like a responsible adult, or at least an adult who knows the meaning of ""responsible."" maybe i'll throw in a reference to the prodigal son and kill a fatted calf for him. that's certainly what's expected of me.  that's certainly what my *son* expects of me.  he ~~wants~~ demands praise and forgiveness and a party and me to hug him and tell him it's all right.  demands me to tell him how proud i am that he's made something of himself.

but i'm not, because he hasn't.  not in the slightest.

his mother and i gave him every opportunity we could.  i don't expect any praise for that, because unlike my son, i don't expect praise for *doing what you're supposed to*.  she and i worked hard to give him a loving, stable, comfortable, supportive home.  we were involved in his school, we introduced him to music (to the extent that any two people can; his mother was a damn good cellist, though) and sports and culture, we fed him healthy meals, we played with him--thanks to him, we got in the best shape we'd ever been in since our 20s--and we let him stumble and fall and make mistakes and *get back up again*.   

he started shoplifting at 15.  the first time we caught him, we bodily dragged him back to the store, made him return the copy of grand theft auto and apologize, and offered to pay for any damages.  the second time we caught him (this time with a pair of shoes), we did the same thing.  the third time, we started going to family therapy.  

therapy seemed to go well, and after a few sessions the therapist asked for a few one-on-one meetings with him.  after two of those, the police came knocking on our door, because the little shit had concocted some story about how we were a religious cult who raped him for breakfast every saturday ... and the dumb chickenshit therapist actually believed him.  rational heads prevailed, we fired that therapist, and he went through six more in as many months, until eventually we couldn't find anyone who would take him as a patient.

by 16, he was drinking.  then we found pot in his bedroom, and in *our* bedroom.  he started leaving needles, bongs, and crack pipes where he knew we'd eventually find them, just to fuck with us.  i know this because he said so, in those exact words.  he had his first intervention and first trip to rehab that year, and his first relapse.

he had to repeat a year of high school at 17, which meant he was now the ringleader of a group of other young dipshits, who saw him as this totemic mentor-shaman who could hook them up with whatever shit they wanted.  i'm also damn sure he started fucking one of his gang's younger sister (13) around then, but i had nothing to go on but my own instincts, so all i could do was tell her parents to keep an eye on her.  no charges were ever pressed, and the family never spoke to me again after that, but they did pull both of their kids out of that school, and my son was furious at me for daring to not let him continue committing statutory rape.

he decided to try for ""normal"" rape later on.  while i was away, he spent an uncharacteristic night at home and on his best behavior.  after his mother went to sleep, he followed her to her bedroom.  he took a knife with him.  he crept into the room, straddled her, put the blade to her throat, and slid his other hand inside her. 

i don't know exactly what happened next.  i know he held her down and tried to undress her.  i know she fought.  i know he stabbed her. i know she got away and locked herself in the bathroom before he could catch her; i hope that means she kicked him good in the balls.  i know she broke the window and screamed for help.  i know he ran.  i know she was lucky the ambulance got to her before she bled to death.  i know he called his friends to brag and beg a ride.  i know the police caught him.

i know if i'd been home, or if *i'd* caught him, i'd have killed him with my bare hands.

the state tried my son as an adult.  he pled out, but only after making his mother testify and smiling the whole time.  she divorced me a month after his sentencing; i looked too much like him.  she killed herself a year later.

i would be a liar if i said i didn't blame him for her death, because i absolutely do.  he was sober when she went to her room, sober when he pulled out his knife, sober when he climbed on top of her, sober when he raped her, sober when he stabbed her, sober when he ran, sober when he called his friends to brag, and sober when the police found him.  when i made the mistake of visiting him after the divorce, he laughed and said she'd had enough of his dick that i could never satisfy her.  when i made the mistake of visiting him after she killed herself, he laughed again and asked how it felt to have ""some prick take your bitch away.""

i should have killed him right there.  it is to my eternal shame that i did not.

they let him out after serving three years.  he spent the next six years on the streets, in and out of rehab, on and off other people's couches, and would grace me every six months or so with a phone call demanding money.  eventually i refused to talk to him unless it was to drive him back to rehab, and i stopped completely after he stole my wallet.  

two years ago, he came to my house with his aunt (his mother's sister) in tow and crocodile tears in his eyes.  he pretended to apologize.  i slammed the door.  his aunt barges in to try to shame me into forgiving the man who raped my wife, caused her death, and laughed about; he stayed outside.  he slashed my tires, threw a brick through a window, and drove off in her car.  his aunt had no idea that he'd taken or keys, or that he'd been armed the whole time.  she blamed me.

he guilted her into letting him stay with her, went to rehab and relapsed, then went again, and here we are.  

in stark contrast to the ball of shit that is my son and his life, i have watched my friends' and colleagues' (those who will still talk to me, that is) children go on to become doctors, lawyers, skilled tradesmen, actors and musicians, academics, entrepreneurs, and career military.  i've seen a few start their own families.  and even the ones who've had a rough start, or who stumbled and fell, managed to pick themselves up again, or are bravely soldiering on.  i have nothing but respect for them.  i also note that *they* do not expect juice and a fucking cookie for having a job and not getting hopped up on meth or raping their mothers for 18 whole months.

my son has pretended to reform before.  he has even convinced himself once or twice.  but he always backslides, always relapses, always finds new ways to disappoint, always hurts other people for his own short-sighted benefit.  his aunt is already at the stage where she is pretending she ""must have forgotten"" where she put some knickknack or piece of jewelry, and has already told me to fuck off after i've warned her of what my son can, will, and has done before, and what he will do again now that he thinks she is weak.  when he fucks up again, when he hurts someone else with his ceaseless bullshit, i will not be there to pick up after him.  i am through with him.  i am through with his aunt.  i cannot talk to her without being overcome with rage and shame as i see the stupid, stupid hope i used to have that my son would ever amount to anything, and i do not need any more disappointment and failure in my life.

i am not proud of my son.  i am sorry for inflicting him upon the world.",11
"my brother and i stole a puppy.  this happened in 2003. my brother and i have never told a single soul. there was an article in the local newspaper about a ~~guy~~ asshole who had killed his dog with a spading fork and this asshole happened to live one house over from where my brother stayed at the time. we knew this because the night of the incident the cops was called on this guy by a neighbor who went to investigate the noise and caught him red handed, this neighbor in turn told my brother. he still had a puppy that the spca for some reason never removed from his care. 

bro and i love dogs and are both pretty pissed and want to kick his ass. so about three days after the article we are having drinks one friday night getting ready to go out and the issue comes up. my brother gets this sly look on his face and tells me we need to ~~steal~~ save the dog as we could hear it whimpering and yelping from time to time and we didn't want it going the same way as it's mom. 

we ditched going out and decided to stay in and wait. at around 2 the next morning we put our plan into action. we jumped the wall of the property next door with some meat and made our way to the dog killers house were i jumped the next wall again to get into his property and lured the puppy to me with the meat. it was obviously scared and barked at me but i eventually managed to grab it and get out. 

the poor animal was terribly neglected and infested with parasites. the next morning when my brothers gf walked into his place the pup was clean, fed and sleeping on the sofa. we told her we found him in the road the night before coming home from the club. she of course helped to find it a good home. no regrets",12

to clarify, the kid who hit me in the chest was a good friend of mine. he did not intend to hurt me. we were just clowning around. the kid who bullied me would just slap me or punch me. i thought he would stop but he never did. i didn't want my brother to do anything about it because i was scared he would get hurt again. he had a level 2 traumatic brain injury from a mountain biking accident and everyone is very protective of him. to those of you who say i should have told on the kid. that is a terrible idea. that would just serve to put a bigger target on my back. then it would have been twenty bullies hitting me every day. 

also, i feel bad for the kid i hit. i feel like his home life isn't all that great. he is always looking for attention. i tried talking to him afterwards but he didn't want to. i did talk to his brother, though, and he was glad i punched him. 

as far as the surgey goes, i think i will do a ama on that because i saw a lot of questions about it from people who have pectus and are curious about the surgery.

"i (38m) irishman recently found out i have a brazilian daughter (19f) i knew nothing about because her mother never told me. dna proved she is mine, but there is a serious language barrier.. 19 years ago i met a brazilian girl who was friends with my brazilian buddy who worked and lived in ireland. she came over to ireland to study and joined our group of friends, we grew close and to put it bluntly we had sex many times. she couldn't stick ireland's climate though and found the culture too different and went back to brazil, she wanted me to apply and move with her back to brazil. but i was in brazil before with my buddy in the late 90's, lovely country, but the climate and culture i found too alien, just like she viewed ireland as too alien. she eventually came to understand and all that shite, we broke up and we went our seperate ways. sadly never heard from her after that. i moved on. 

fastforward to half a year ago i'm at home after long day at work, doorbell rings, i answer the door and there she is again, this time with a young woman beside her. she explains that the girl is my daughter. i instantly believe it to be a real possibility, the girls age matches up to when we were together, she is quite fair and has similiar green eyes to me, and me and her mother did not have protected sex. i invite them in to ask all the standard questions. the girl really started to get emotional and cried and got angry at her mother and then looked at me crying asking in broken english was i really her papa? i said i don't know, but we can do a dna test and find out which her mother translated to her.  we did the dna test as fast as possible due to the fact they aren't eu citizens so only had a certain amount of time here and weren't here on work visas. did the dna test and yup, it turns out i'm her papa. i'm overjoyed, i never had kids in the 19 years since, always felt bad that i was a 38 guy without a family, as i've never been good at staying in long term relationships. i am quite pissed at her mother, her explanation was that i wouldn't move with her to brazil so i was no longer relevant to her, pregnant or not, the only reason she brought our girl to finally meet me is because my daughter kept begging to know who her father and she decided once my daughter was an adult she would bring her over to meet her father. this is warped and fucked, but what matters now is my daughter and not her mother. 

&#x200b;

anyway now that the backstory in out of the way. my daughter is getting irish citizenship as i am her father and am irish which allows her to. her mother has gone back to brazil. she is living with me now for the time being and wants to get to know me better, she is very affectionate and we get along amazingly she is into many of the same movies, genres as i am which allows us to connect despite the language barrier. i will never get used to being called ''papa'' though as in ireland we call our parents, da, daddy or dad. she is going to start learning english via tutor. she finds the language very difficult at the moment and i have been trying to personally help her learn it as best i can too, but it can be frustrating when trying to communicate with her.  i am crap at languages and can only understand a few key portugese words. she has quickly filled a hole in my life, is a joy and i feel like i have a lot to life for. any advice is appreciated.",7
"by asking my neighbor ""who died?"". so this happened like 2 hours ago, but it needs some preface.

about 3 weeks ago my neighbor saw me dressed in all black leaving for work and he asked me, ""who died?"" i laughed. he laughed. we all had a good time. today—i'm heading to my car, and i see him and his wife dressed in all black so i obviously asked, ""who died?""
 
his wife breaks down and starts hardcore crying. turns out her mom had just died. she then proceeds to lecture me about making fun of death as she's still crying at a 6/10. her husband never said anything about the fact that he made the same joke 3 weeks ago, which is fine. i wouldn't have either. 

so now i'm gonna avoid her forever. i know it's not the craziest tifu, but now i'll respect death forever.

"i found and read my dad's journals... ok sorry if the formating or spelling bad, i'm on my phone and just had to get this out there, i've been upset since this happened.

well it started innocent enough, i was looking for our picture albums. i want to make him a little scrapbook for fathers day.. anyways, i found a couple of boxes he had stuffed away in his closet. so i guess curiosity isn't always a good thing this time. i opened one of the boxes and of course started reading. 

and the one i read made me both angry and sad. apparently, when i was younger (5yrs old or so), someone from either school or around town, called child protective services on my dad. he never mentioned this to me and all i was told, is that these people just want to make sure ""we were safe and doing ok"" now, my dad raised me pretty much alone, my mom passed when i was very young, and i never really knew here. i will say my dad isn't a ""normal"" looking dad (especially back then). what i mean i guess is he's the tough tattooed looking guy, like you'd think is more likely to see him in a fight rather than playing outside with a 5yr old girl.. 

i know most people (still) judge him as soon as the see him, but once you get to know him, well not even that, just talk to him and you'll see he's the kindest guy you'll know. 

anyways, in his journal he wrote about cps coming for weekly, then monthly check ups and the case worker always seemed worried him about some little something they found ""odd"" in the house (like omg he left some dangerous looking tools out in the garage).  when he started writing about making changes to start looking like a ""dad"", my heart broke. he wrote about why and when he cut his hair short because of it and even looked into tattoo removal (which he couldn't afford, thank god, i love his tattoos he's told me the story of each and everyone), he even tried as he put it ""dress more classy"". trying to prove to these people that he was a good dad. 

but, none of this worked, cps still came by (from what i tell, they stopped when i 10 or 11yrs old or so).  he wrote about time that if i did any little thing wrong in class teachers always questioned his parenting, telling him things like ""he wouldn't be able to raise a daughter properly, he should find a woman""... 

the times he tried to participate with the pta or help on field trips or whatever and he was always rejected. i hate, hate how they acted towards him and it breaks my heart. he's never talked about this to me, or even let if show that he was uncomfortable when i did school activities. there's more in these journals but that's enough for now, that's my confession.",12
"i found my wife's r/unsentletters throwaway account and i haven't told her. she doesn't post very often but when i found it six months ago she'd posted five times in one year and she's posted twice since then. most have been addressed to me. 

i feel like i'm violating her trust on the one hand, on the other hand, she is posting these letters to a public forum where anybody can see them. 

she forgot to log out of her account one day so i noticed the username and didn't think much of it at the time. thought maybe it was one of my kids friends who had used our computer then got distracted back with whatever i was doing. 

then one night i'm scrolling through unsent letters and i see this username, so i read the letter, and it's very clearly describing a situation between my wife and i. 

so i go into the post history and i learn a lot of things. feelings she has for an old boyfriend (who she's found reasons to meet up with twice and nothing's happened, though part of her would like something to) chief among them. 

i want to broach this subject with her, get all these problems out in the open, work through them. i don't want her to feel as though i violated her trust though. i'm caught. 

i also don't want to risk accidentally saying something that gives away that i know these things. 

i also don't have any intention of stopping following up on posts from this account.

"for contacting the mom of my daughter's (15f) boyfriend (15m) regarding some concerning behavior and messages?. so my 15 year old daughter is in her first ""serious"" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  i put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  my daughter and i have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  i am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.

the problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  he calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  she has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  he has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  she recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.

she sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  i was very proud of the way she handled it.  we have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  i think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.

last night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying ""babe, call me"" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  it was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  he then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  he then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  she.  is.  done.

as a mom, i would want to know if my son (13m) was treating someone like this.  i recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  we have chatted in the past, and i have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  or would i be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?

&#x200b;

update:  i talked with my daughter tonight and told her that i was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (for the record, i would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  i respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  i explained that i don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and i am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  but i have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  i am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.

she was not upset at all and said she understood why i would want to call his mom.  she asked that i wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  we agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by friday, i will make the call.  as a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  she is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  

&#x200b;

also, for those of you who have asked... from a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  we never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  when problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  so her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.  i'm so happy that years of those types of conversations worked and she has a very good grasp on what health interactions look like!",3
"i just ate a bowl of soup. doesnt sound like much, but its the first time in a couple months ive had a full serving of something.
i cried before eating it.
i cried over a spoonful of potato salad yesterday.
i cried over a slice of pizza the day before that.
i know its all in my head, and soup isnt that filling, but i had an entire bowl. multiple mouthfuls. my heart was racing the entire time but i did it.

eating is hard but im going to beat this disorder.

pretty long edit: so its 1am, im tearing up reading comments, and ive just woken up from a forced nap because i was attempting to make boiled eggs, messed it up twice (apparently im terrible at cooking boiled eggs?) and then my stomach started hurting too bad for me to stand up. which made me incredibly nervous because i have a phobia of being sick. so intense tummy pains and feeling sick are terrifyinggg. i unfortunately havent been able to eat more since the soup but ill try again today!

i didnt expect any responses to this, let alone this amount and how bloody supportive they all are.
i just needed to talk about my little victory, because while my parents are so so supportive they dont entirely understand how it all works. my family all understand that i am struggling and have been struggling, but theyre very ""its all in your head you need to just get on with it"" kind of people. not in a mean way, just in a them way. 
so its been so lovely reading all of the 100+ comments of pure support. 

at the minute my mindset about recovery is i think pretty damn good. while the thought of gaining weight makes me very uncomfortable, and the thought of not being able to lose weight like i was is mildly upsetting, i absolutely do not want to starve myself anymore. i want nothing more than to be able to eat normaly. 
not eating for months has been horrific, i have felt weak, sick, and dizzy every single day, i have become incredibly anxious about everything, im struggling with any kind of public appearance at all. 
but im hoping once my eating is fixed and my body starts acting somewhat normaly then i can then move to focus on the other things! 
i have had some really scary moments while restricting one being my paramedic neighbour had to take my blood sugar because i was unable to stand up after not eating for 3 days, and basically told me i was close to passing out because it was so low. and honestly i felt like i was dying. i have never been so scared, and i never want to feel like that again. 

there was a point last year where i was eating fairly well, i was going to the gym,i was genuinely happy, and my mental health was the best it had every been. and i am so determined to reach that point again. if i could beat my eating disorder last year, albeit i fell back into it very quickly, then i can sure as hell do it again. 

so once again, thank you all so so much for all of the comments and support. as crappy as my body feels while its trying to get used to actually being fed, the optimism i now how is making me see how bloody worth it its going to be.

i love all of you so much honestly 💕",11

"by unzipping my balls. not sure if this disqualified me but it actually happened a few minutes ago. just before my shower i decided to do a bit of manscaping on the ol' vagina miner. grabbed the dedicated clippers and went to town knocking back some of that kentucky fescue when i spotted one slightly angry looking follicle. positionally, we're talking less on alvin and moreso on the chipmunks. as any sane person would do, i grabbed some tweezers with the intention of yanking the little shit out (the hair not the dick). i squeezed the hair with my tweezers, and being the baby i am, gave it a fast tug. and because the universe is a cold-hearted bitch, it turned out that this hair wasn't your standard ingrown. nah. this greedy fiber decided it wasn't enough to coil up in a small ball and just uncoil like your grandmother's knitting yarn. instead, it chose to grow at a near 90° to my taco bender so when i gave it that sweet tug of justice it split open my hog like fedex shipping envelope. and so here i stand with one hand clutching toilet paper against my angry inch while the other types this out to you fine dimes. hope you have a great saturday and can manage to keep your favorite penis in better shape than i have.

"florida 'no surprises' law.. just thought i'd share this as i sometimes see health insurance issues here.

i was about to just write a check and be done with it and decided to call and pay with my rewards credit card so it wasn't a total loss. i complained about the bill to the customer service rep i got and she said 'let me put you on hold because florida has a no surprises law'.  while on hold i googled it and it passed in 2016.

"(final update) my new employer has a creative way of doing payroll that just doesnt seem...legal. are you ready for a justice boner?. edit: a word and a state. sc. 

i was waiting to update this pending big doings by the corporate office, so thank you. 

so i quit, though i bet you all saw that coming. 

i gave 4 weeks notice per the crazy ass owners ""requirement"" because i decided to move out of state and had the time. 

then he decided to try and screw me. when the schedule for my last 2 weeks came out, i wasn't on it. he apparently told the manager not to schedule me because i was ""toxic"" and ""not a team player"". 

but, as the saying goes, i didn't get mad. i got even. 

i knew he would try to call me in. because that's what happens when you only have two people to close and one isn't working. so every time he called i said ""i wasn't scheduled today, so i made plans.""

after about a week he threatened to fire me. my response? ""you already did. constructive dismissal exists. you reduced my hours to zero, basically firing me. i've already been to the unemployment office."" (i didn't, i was moving, but i wanted to hear his heart audibly stop.)

then i asked about my last check. since he's fired me, i needed to pick it up. he said i could get it on payday and hung up. 

i should also note that during this time i sent very lengthy email to the corporate office detailing every single shady and illegal thing this ass was doing. from trying to write work arounds for labor laws into the hand book, to getting employees to pay him back ""overpayments"" with personal checks, to the contamination, all of it. with pictures. 

so payday rolls around. no check. i call and no one answers. i go in person and no one knows anything because apparently, no one got paid. no one. not even the managers. there's no direct deposit, he always cut paper checks (and forward dated them 3 days) so everyone was screwed. 

but me? i was walking on sunshine. straight to small claims the next day with a written letter from the assistant manager (who's a friend, tbh) verifying that i had quit and not been paid and calls to the owner about it hadn't been returned. he had two days or until the next pay period, as long as it didn't exceed 30 days, to pay me after separation. 

he showed up and tried to say the internet was down, which is why i wasn't paid on time, but the judge was having none of it. i got the max i could claim, 3x what he originally owed me. and the joy of seeing him get dressed way tf down. 

and it gets better. due to my emails and photos (along with other employees who made reports) corporate descended on that franchise like a swarm of angry valkyries. 

i was long gone and moved away by the time they actually did anything but he got ousted. 

officially, he turned it over to spend time with his family (cause his daughter joined a christian cult and ran away???)  but really corporate was furious at the shit he was doing and the terrible reputation the place had (essentially damaging the brand) so they threatened to rain legal brimstone down on him so hard it would make god jealous unless he turned the store over. 

according to the assistant manager anyways.

the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a wwii german ju87 stuka dive bomber(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junkers_ju_87). it was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

"if you want to make sure someone has learned the correct process, make them deliberately do everything as wrong as possible. speaking as a teacher (and anyone in an educational or supervisory role will likely relate), one of the most frustrating things is when you explain a task to someone and check that they understand, only for them to completely botch it. in fairness, we often do make assumptions that because *we* can do it well, others will have the intuition to also have the same skill and knowledge. it's difficult for a learner to recognise and validate their own process as being correct. however, people are very good at recognising when something is wrong.

the way this concept was introduced to me was to play two games of tic-tac-toe. the first game: play as normal and see who wins. you normally see some cockiness as people try to outplay each other and reach the inevitable draw. there's no real thought process of how to win, just making sure the other person doesn't.

second game: the goal was to *intentionally lose*. suddenly, the room fell quiet. each player had to think about doing the *wrong* move in order to lose. there was much more reflection and processing than playing to win.

this was then explained in the context of doing powerpoint presentations. we have an idea of what a good presentation should look like (clear bullet points, minimal text, minimal distractions, etc.), but we never seem to get students to understand what we expect. turn the expectations around: as a pre-task, get them to make the *worst possible presentation*, and you suddenly get a bunch of people engaged in outdoing each other in throwing in walls of text, spinny animations and multiple soundtracks. when the students made their proper presentations, they avoided all the things that they had deliberately done wrong.

whether you're teaching someone else, or teaching yourself, it may be helpful to do it wrong.

**obligatory clarification edits:**

1. this is intended to be a one-off exercise to **check** understanding. don't deliberately teach people the wrong method to do this.
2. the key is that the learner is **intentionally** making the wrong move, not accidentally or unknowingly. they must be aware that it is wrong.
3. don't do this in a real, practical situation. this is a learning and training tip.",8

"for stealing my friends bird. i love birds, and i'm the proud owner of 2 budgies. i've had them for about a year and a half. when i first got them, my friend fell in love decided she wanted one of her own.

she then proceeded to spend the least amount of money she could on a cage and decorated it with minimal accessories. she got the bird, and while she seemed to like it at first, she basically ignored it after a month. 

every time i went over to her house, i told her that it needed more attention. it just sat in the corner all day, silent, occasionally gnawing at the only toy in the cage, which was shredded and worn within the first couple of months. its food and water were probably only changed once a week. it was living above a mountain of poop because she never changed the tray.

i told her repeatedly that she was neglecting her bird. and despite promising to do better, she never did. 

i asked her if i could have it. she got really upset with me, saying that she had paid for it so she had the right to do what she wanted with it. 

i felt really horrible every time i went over there. i decided i wanted to steal it. i felt like i could give it a better life. it could even make friends with my 2 birds. i just couldn't let it live the rest of its life unhappy in the corner of a cage, doing nothing. 

so i did it. she was in the bathroom, and i took a shoe box i had hidden in my backpack and got the bird in. it was scared at first, but it calmed down in the box. i left without even saying goodbye. 

soon after i got a phone call which basically consisted of her yelling at me for a long while. i said that i'd give back her bird if she bought it a bigger cage, more toys, and promised to take better care of it. she once again used the argument of, ""its my bird, i can do what i want with it.""

i took it home, where it livened up in the presence of my 2 other birds. it began chirping for the first time i had ever heard. it seemed very happy. 

this was all 3 days ago. my friend is still extremely pissed at me for not giving her bird back and is saying i'm being an asshole. so reddit, aita?

update: wow, i was not expecting this to get so huge. 

i honestly went into this thinking i was going to keep the bird for probably 1 day or something before she profusely apologized and vowed to change her ways. she didn't. like i said, i would have given it back if she had. 

i guess i just figured that she needed something drastic to snap her into the reality that she was neglecting her bird. which now, after reading the comments, i understand was a pretty immature way of handling things. 

today i offered her $50 as reimbursement, which was double what she bought the bird for. she took it and is letting me keep the bird. but she still hates me. honestly, at this point, i couldn't care less. the bird is safe. that's all that matters.

i think i could've handled it better, but i don't regret my choices. thanks for the advice, support, and reality checks, everyone.",3
"we can't see beyond the observable universe because light from there hasn't reached us yet. but since light always moves, shouldn't that mean that ""new"" light is arriving at earth. this would mean that our observable universe is getting larger every day. is this the case?. the observable universe is the light that has managed to reach us in the 13.8 billion years the universe exists. because light beyond there hasn't reached us yet, we can't see what's there. this is one of the biggest mysteries in the universe today.

but, since the universe is getting older and new light reaches earth, shouldn't that mean that we see more new things of the universe every day.

when new light arrives at earth, does that mean that the observable universe is getting bigger?

"by drinking starbucks.. i'm currently in bed, huddled under the covers and riding out the shockwaves of trauma from this event. 

my first fuck-up was trying to cut out caffeine a few months ago. i succeeded, but also lost my tolerance for caffeine (was drinking an average of 8 espresso shots throughout the day). 

today, maybe two hours ago, i went to a doctors appointment. this appointment was in a huge hospital, one that had a food court and of course, a starbucks. it was a mental-health related program, so i was a bit on-edge afterwards. i saw the sign for starbucks and the clouds of depression began to life. oh hell yes, the sweet nectar of life beckons to me. 
i get in line and order a medium sized coffee, cream and sugar - something tame, i thought to myself. not tame enough apparently. 

i got in the car and started to drive home. about ten minutes away, i feel a bubbling in my gut. oh boy. it's fine, i say to myself, i can make it home without incident. oh, how wrong i was. 

while i had been focused on keeping my asshole clenched, i had forgotten that nearly every road and intersection on my way home was clogged up by construction. detours everywhere. every time i thought i was getting close to home, i was forced to backtrack and drive a few streets over. at this point, i'm sweating and shaking, my legs are essentially vibrating, and i have no idea how i haven't passed out at the wheel yet. 

and then it hits me. the cramps. i got my fucking period. in the car. 

any person with a uterus will tell you how bad cramps are until they are blue in the face. i will do the same, because when i ovulate, i get cysts all over my ovaries due to pcos (polycystic ovarian syndrome). needless to say, it makes everything way more awful than it needs to be. 

my abdomen tightens up, trying to force all of the coffee-afterbirth and uterine tissue out of me, but i resist. i will not shit my car, and i certainly will not bleed onto my seats. that shit isn't even paid off yet. 

i get re-routed for what feels like the millionth time, and finally i see it: a road to home with no construction. i step on the gas and swing around every corner with the gumption and moxie of an f1 driver. in doing this, i have fucked up again. 

i currently have an inner-ear infection, and in my haste i have shaken up all the liquid in my cochlea. vertigo. vertigo like you wouldn't believe. 

to recap: i'm holding in a torrent of liquid regret, clenching my pelvic floor muscles to keep as much of my uterus inside of me as possible, and now i'm dizzy enough that i could no longer tell if my eyes were crossed or not. 

i fly into my driveway, throw my car in park and yank my keys out. i run to my porcelain throne as fast as my entirely clenched body would allow me, all the while bumping into things in my way because the vertigo hadn't gone away yet and i was effectively as coordinated as a drunk person. 

when i say it was a photo finish, i'm not joking. i started shitting before my ass even hit the toilet (everything landed in the bowl tho, thankfully). i was sitting there for, legitimately, nearly 45 minutes. 100% liquid. and it didn't stop for more than three seconds at a time. once it was over i felt like i had run a marathon wearing lead boots. all of my energy was gone. i crawled upstairs on my hands and knees with the intent of getting in bed, but had to make a mad dash for the bathroom once again and do it all a second time. finally got myself in the shower to rinse off all of my sweat and potential residue of my poor choices... and then had to stop mid-shower for a third round of misery. i feel another round coming, so this is probably the end of my post. 

tl;dr - if you're drinking coffee and have to drive home immediately after, maybe shit before you leave the coffee shop.

"stop telling me i'm ""lucky i'm so skinny."". i grew up heavy. not super overweight but thick enough that i got bullied and couldn't run as fast as the fast kids in middle school. i've been battling an eating disorder since high school, wake up two hours before my classes to go to the gym, constantly focus on eating right, watch my friends eat pizza and wings while i snack on carrots and celery, and do everything i can to not miss meals, pay attention to the meal reminders on my phone, and really keep myself healthy and in good shape. 

none of this is luck. it's hard work and i struggle a lot. there are days when i don't want to get up but i push myself. there are times when i am so depressed about my body image that i just want to cry looking at the mirror but i just take a deep breath and try to harness that in the next day's workout. 

i work damn hard to be where i am, so it really drives me insane when somebody tells me i'm ""so lucky that i am skinny"" because i am not lucky. i am determined, disciplined, strong, and fighting every day. i'm not adonis by any means and i'm really not even that muscular, but it's hard work and that never gets acknowledged. the whole thing is just chalked up to luck because people don't want to put the work in.

"when i adjusted my bra in front of a cute guy.. i am cringing while writing this. i was going to a library to study (i'm in college, yay ) and i saw this cute guy as i'm walking in. i was thinking ""hot damn, he fine"" but i didn't think he saw me so i sat down at a table that was empty. it's early morning on a friday, so no one was there. i was in a rush to leave dorms, so my bra was not fitting right at all-tmi but basically only 40% of my left boob was actually in the bra.

since the library room i was in was basically empty i had the bright idea to, with both hands, grab my bra (through my shirt, don't worry)and hitch it up. i can't exaggerate this enough-this was not a sly fixing of the strap, or a gentle adjusting of a side boob: i was fondling myself. 

literally as i am grabbing my breasts, the cute boy, who was still deciding where to sit, chose to walk back in my direction and saw the whole thing, which i only realized when i looked up.

then he chose to sit next to me? i don't know why? do boys find girls who viciously yank at their bras in libraries on friday mornings attractive? but i was so embarrassed at this point, and my face was hot, so i didn't even look at him. he kept sneaking glances at me, and i have no idea what he was thinking. that i was psycho? that he had to sit in that seat because it was too late to turn back? i don't know. 

anyway, to add to this, my stomach kept rumbling in the quiet library. it's at that point that i decided i had to get out of there, and of course i tripped as i tried to stand. anyway. that's me. this is my life. thoughts? comments? help? 

tldr: a cute boy in a library saw me trying to stuff my boobs back into my bra.

"my longer term boyfriend m25 told me that i f22 was not completely satisfying him in bed. he asked for an open relationship and now he has a fwb, but he's upset with me now for recently finding one as well.. my boyfriend and i have been together for over 5 years and a couple of months ago he told me he felt like he wasn't completely satisfied in the bedroom. i was pretty hurt by this but i can understand it because my libido has been very low due to the stress of my job. i asked him if he was just interested in trying something new and that's when he proposed the idea of an open relationship. this really hurt my feelings, but i didn't say no because i wanted to please him. i told him okay, but that i didn't want to hear about the sexual exchanges he was about to have. we agreed to keep things to ourselves if we got involved with anyone. 

he has a fwb relationship with a girl he met on an app now. he told me that without going into detail about their relationship and i kind of just acted like she didn't exist until recently. recently i met up with a guy i used to go to school with and we went out for drinks to catch up. we ended up hooking up that night and since then we've continued having sex. he's introduced me to new things and i really enjoy the sex honestly, it's better than the sex i've been having with my boyfriend. 

i still love my boyfriend but the reaction he gave me upon finding out about my sexual relationship with a guy from college has me kind of upset and angry with him. he asked me if i had been seeing anyone else sexually and i told him yes without giving any details. he **begged** me to tell him what my fwb does to me and how exactly i please my fwb in bed. i told him i wasn't going into detail because that was what we had agreed on. he asked me if the sex was better than our sex. i told him honestly, but without detail, that i enjoyed sex with my fwb more because we had been trying new things.

he basically blew up on me and told me i'm not allowed to have a fwb. i said to him, ""well you have one!"" and he responded to me with ""this isn't about me, this is about you being a slut."" truly unbelievable. 

what the hell do i do in this kind of situation? is it just me, or is he being unfair?

edit : people seem to be confused here. as i stated in a previous comment, my sex drive was low for a while but after a few months of him being with another woman, it started to pick up again. and every time i wanted to have sex with him, he would push me away because he was ""too tired from already have sex"" (with his fwb) or he would engage but he would half ass it even when i was really into it. 

if you're gonna post a judgmental rude comment about how i'm ""lying"" about my low libido and how i hurt my boyfriend by having sex with someone else, then fuck off. he spent months having sex with another girl and i had no choice but to reach out to someone else for satisfaction. he stopped having sex with me. even when i wanted it.",7
"giving myself head and throwing out my back. (reposted at the appropriate time with some adjustments!)

this happened about 3 days ago, i'm finally able to move and get out of bed.

so i am generously endowed, and have a very good relationship with my dick. lol. i occasionally post images on reddit and other places, and someone asked me if i could perform auto-fellatio. i hadn't ever thought of it, so i read some tips, watched some videos and realized that because of my size and my general skinny frame, i have the ideal body type for sucking my own d. how exciting lol.
so, there are a few different approaches, leaning forward or legs over your head. i tried the leaning forward approach but had no luck at all, so then i was like fuck it, got naked, layed down near a wall, threw my legs over my head, and slowly ""walked down the wall"" as the advice was. holy shit i was close. let me also say i was very aroused at the moment, and this was a few days of arousal, so my cock was extra hard and the head was pulsating. as the head flexed and i did, i got my tongue on the tip of my dick basically on the first try. wow. i was excited and turned on, and hard as fuck.

so, i started stroking and pulling my cock closer to my mouth and it started getting even harder and now i can basically put my lips on the head. it felt insane and i was so happy. as i was stroking, my lips were able to almost fully cover the head, and i started to suckle. it didn't take much. the whole situation caused a deep orgasm. the shaking kind.

sidebar- yes i came in my mouth. for reference i am totally straight and have never had a dick in my mouth. okay back to the story...

so i'm shaking, feet over my head, dick in my mouth, and the final release pushed my body into a further position, and there it was. not really sure what popped, but i collapsed onto my side and literally couldn't move. cum dripping out of my mouth, laying on my side, naked, in the bathroom.
luckily feeling came back soon and but i couldnt stand up. crawled to bed... had a friend bring me some muscle relaxers, said i tweaked it ""cleaning under the counters"" lol. still in bed, but can actually walk today for the first day. 

luckily i don't need to explain this to a doctor.

tl:dr - sucked my own d, came in my mouth, threw out my back.

edit:  thank you for all of the advice (and the offers, lol).  i will not fuck around with this any more.

edit 2: i spit, but not totally intentionally.  it was that moment that all went to hell.  not sure what i would have done if i was thinking about it.

edit 3:  c'mon guys, sucking your own dick is as gay as jerking off or playing with your ass.  get over it. if you're that afraid of you're own body, that's weird, and super homophobic

edit 4: ""i've heard it feels more like sucking dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i've never sucked a dick, so i can't tell you, and yes, it didn't feel like getting head from another person.  but it was very pleasurable and felt better than my good ol' hand.

"sister's ex-boyfriend keeps playing ding dong ditch despite us having a ring doorbell and restraining order. cops can't find him when we call them.. i'll spare the details of the breakup, but essentially my sister's ex has been bothering us for about half a year now. we're in **ca**. relevant events since the start of 2019 include:

1. filing a restraining order and being granted a temporary restraining (about 3 months ago)
2. ex being arrested for violating the temporary restraining order and being jailed for a day.
3. getting the permanent restraining order
4. being arrested for violating the permanent restraining order for a month and being released on probation. probation conditions explicitly state he is to not contact my sister or be within her vicinity.

despite being on probation, he's playing ding dong ditch at random times during the late night for the past week. we have video evidence of him being here through our ring doorbell. we've called the cops multiple times and they take a while to get here and by that time they can't find him (or they don't try too hard).

her ex is homeless, living in his car (probably), and disowned by his parents so we don't really have a clue where he is during the day.

it was easier to get him arrested the first couple times because he actually stuck around for someone to open the door, but now he's given up on that completely and he does not seem in his right mind anymore. last time i spoke with him, he claimed to be hearing voices and we've heard him talking to himself a couple times on the ring videos. he's not doing anything violent, but you never know, he could snap and do something crazy one day.

my sister spoke to his probation officer and told her the situation. he's currently scheduled to appear to court next month to address his probation violation.

i'm not sure if there's anything else we *can* do about this situation other than keep calling the cops and hope he attends his hearing next month. anything else that could possibly help us?

"today makes 9 years sober..  

i never thought it would happen.  i never thought i would break the addiction cycle.  but... here i am.  stronger than i ever thought i could be.  

at one point, i remember sitting in my room, doing anything i could to numb the pain of life.  i hated myself.  i hated myself so much that i was killing myself a little each day, and i was okay with that.  i didn't care what happened, i just wanted the ""head change"" that would come each time i picked up the pipe.  i would try to remember a time when life wasn't so ridiculously hard.  

i could look back upon my life and try to pinpoint the exact moment i became an addict.  but why?  what would it matter?  i know who i am today, i know my limits and i know where i belong.  i have family (which isn't always blood) and they love me and support me unconditionally.  i have a husband, and children, we have a home and we are saving to buy a house.  i never thought i could have those things.  they weren't for me.  i was worthless.  

overall, the last 9 years have been better than i ever thought i deserved.  my feelings of gratitude to my friends that support me, and have forgiven me, is immeasurable.  i get slightly emotional when i look back.  i couldn't have done it without them.  while the last 2-3  years, we have grown apart slightly (just life stuff), they will always be spoken of very highly by me, as i would not be the person i am today without their willingness to forgive and willingness to support me through one of the hardest times of my life.  

i don't really talk about ""the dark years"" now.  i feel like i'm officially on the other side of them.  i guess that's why i'm posting here.  i'm thankful that i have this outlet.

"me 18m and 9 other friends 18m on holiday in spain. one friend won't pay for the villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. shall we kick him out?. okay so it's essentially the title but i'll try to explain it as best as i can. names have been changed. 


there are 10 of us in total. 8 of us in the villa, and 2 have an apartment near our villa. 


1) harry was going to come. 


2) harry cancelled around 1 week before we were going to come, so we didn't know until then that he wasn't going to come. 

3) zack was going to come. 


4) zack cancelled around 1 month before we were going to come, so we had plenty of time to find a replacement. 


5) hank and mark replaced them but none of us were told, one guy literally invited them out of nowhere, and none of us are that close with both of them. they both said yes. 


6) he asked them both, even though at that time only zack had cancelled. they both said yes, so they decided hank stay in the villa, and mark would get an apartment near us as well. 


7) hank is replacing zack. at this point we didn't know harry wasn't coming. 


8) hank is booked in for the villa, he pays all the money like everyone else (£240 just for villa for 1 week). 


9) as we didn't know harry was going to cancel, mark books his own little apartment near to the other 2 people. 


10) harry cancels around 1 week before we're about to leave. 


11) without the rest of us knowing mark refund his apartment, and decides to just stay in our villa, even though we've told the villa owner there's 7 of us only, since harry cancelled. 


12) we had to show and sign documents showing our passports, and documentation basically to confirm there is only 7 of us staying in the villa. 


13) so, the only thing mark has paid for is is own flight which is £160. 


14) so, he needs to pay around £240 for staying in the villa for 1 week, like everyone else has.
 

15) the rest of us only found out yesterday that he hasn't paid, but he's already said to 2 other people, he's not gonna pay because ""its easier for me"". 


16) he goes ""i'm doing you guys a favour by taking the extra spot that harry was gonna go on"" ?!?!?!


17) also, basically because harry isn't coming we all decided to do something nice and all give him the refundable deposit for the villa which was £250 which means between us we are paying like £35 for the deposit. by doing this we are minimising the amount of money he loses, since some of the things he paid was non-refundable.  


18) if you think about it, if mark paid, we would all get our deposit back. but he's not, and the deposit that's going to hank, is covering £250 worth of the shit at the villa. the villa that mark is staying at free of charge because it's ""easier"". 


19) so we are literally paying £250 to mark essentially  and he is saying ""im doing you guys a favour"". we are basically paying for his holiday, and losing money ourselves. 


20) so yeah we are going to ask him to pay later on otherwise he's not staying in the villa he can actually fuck off and find some other accommodation. do you think that's fair? but we really don't want to put him out on the streets, but we don't know how else to get him to pay. 


21) if he says he will pay after the holiday, he literally and simply just won't, he will be lying, and after the holiday is done there's nothing that we can do really. 


22) how can we get him to pay? if he pays that means we can all get our refundable deposit back too, which is around £35 per person which would be nice too. 


23) 2 people have asked him to pay already, and he told them all to fuck off. we know for a fact that he has the money, so that's not the issue. he himself has money in his account, and his family is also decently well off, like not poor or anything. 

edit : some confusion, we are in spain right now. it's been 3 of our 7 days. 


what can we do? how can we get him to pay?

"by getting my tonsils removed. i like many people in adulthood have had to deal with the annoyance of overgrown tonsils. from the 3 – 4 times a year tonsillitis, to the sleep apnoea that they cause. personally, i wanted my tonsils gone.

after getting tonsillitis for the second time this year i decided enough is enough, i booked an appointment with my gp, referred to the surgeon and made a date for the surgery.

i was warned that i was in for the sorest through of my life and that it was going to be agony for a while. which was ok, how bad could it be?

day 1: i was prepped and ready to go, surprisingly not too nervous for my first major surgery. the procedure went well, my tonsils were gone and i was all set to recover in hospital. the pain wasn't too high yet, i was still spaced out from the drugs, so all in all the first night was quite easy.

day 2:

4am: i woke up needing to go to the bathroom, i felt like i needed to spit so i rushed over to the bathroom sink. i spat out a few mouthfuls of blood not thinking too much of it. i slowly shuffled back to my bed and quickly fell back asleep.

7:30am: this time i awoke to a lot of pain, i buzzed the nurse to get my dose of endone and panadol. i mentioned to her that i had bled a little overnight. she was immediately concerned, she passed me a plastic cup and told me to spit all the blood that comes up from now.

(i thought that leaking blood would be common as it was when i got my wisdom teeth out.)

for the next few hours slowly but surely i was filling up this cup that looked more and more like red wine. it was horrible because the pain was quite high regardless of the pain killers, i couldn't lie down an rest as the blood would go in to my stomach.

10pm: the nurses tried to use an ice pack on my neck and give me countless icy poles to freeze the blood but nothing was working, i had filled almost two cups now and they decided it was time to call my surgeon.
they broke the bad news to me and told me i needed to be prepped for surgery again. i was surprisingly ok with it. i remained calm and collected. i went through the procedure again of getting countless needles and being sedated. (fun!)

post second surgery: i was back where i was today but hopefully no more bleeding! the surgeon informed me that a blood vessel had haemorrhaged around my tonsil area causing blood to leak. i had to have blood sucked out of my stomach because i had indeed swallowed quite a bit of blood.

he told me that this complication only happens once a year for him! (lucky me.)

day 3-4:

the recovery was brutal and painful, i was in bed all day, struggling to get any solids down as the pain was too bad to swallow. however, no complications.

day 5:
for anyone who has had the pleasure of having a tonsillectomy you would know the most painful part about it is waking up from a snooze.

i learnt that the best thing to do is get up, drink some water and have some meds asap!

i was getting out of the shower when i felt a large amount of liquid in my mouth, i leaned over the sink and spat out blood.

here is a picture of the sink: https://m.imgur.com/kpxtomf

my mum, who had been amazing throughout this whole thing, was luckily around the corner from my home when this happened. so i called her and we decided the safest bet would be returning to hospital.

i felt very unwell in the car ride, and i was pale as a ghost. they quickly put an iv in and gave me fluids.

after a very long wait we were advised by my surgeon to return home and come back in if it were to happen again.

i returned home and rested up for a few hours, it was around 9pm when i felt the same liquid taste in the back of my throat. this time i knew. i rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to cough up blood.

here's a photo of this time: http://imgur.com/s2yfx39

as you can see, it's a lot more this time around.

i don't know if you have ever had the displeasure of coughing up blood but the worst part about it is just how sticky blood is. it sticks to your tongue, throat and lips, resulting in blood clots getting stuck in your mouth. it's horrible.

i called my mum and she rushed over to come get me.

back to hospital again and another iv :)

i was admitted back to the ward and i stayed overnight, my night wasn't overly dramatic. i bled once around 3-4am but it only lasted 5 minutes so there wasn't much for concern.

day 6!!!!

things were looking ok, i was still in a lot of pain but i had not bled outside of the little one in the morning.

1pm: i was watching shitty daytime tv as i reached to have a sip of water, i felt that same feeling in my throat come on and it felt heavy quick.

i had no time to react so i grabbed the smoothie cup i had received from my mum and proceeded to spit mouthfuls of blood in to it. i was trying to get a hold of my buzzer to notify the nurse.

they came in shortly after and rushed to get me a vomit bag, it was coming fast. the nurses were trying to keep me calm and they again put an ice pack behind my neck to try and slow down the bleeding. i kept coughing it up. i started making gagging noises as the blood was sticking and clotting around my throat.

i started to feel light headed. within seconds of saying that, i fainted.

i woke up seconds later to the ward now being in code blue, i had never seen so many nurses and doctors in one room so fast. there must have been 15-20 people in this small room. i had needles going in to my arms, an oxygen mask being put on, and multiple nurses and doctors talking to me.

""raph, stay with us.""

""raph, look at me, keep your eyes open.""

this was the first time in my life that i was genuinely scared for my life.

i could overhear that they were trying to get a hold of my surgeon, because once again i needed emergency surgery.

i was rushed into theatre and they prepped me again. giving me another iv there was a delay because my surgeon was finishing up surgery for another patient at another hospital.

it was at this moment where i broke down crying. i felt so sick, all i could taste was blood, i was scared, alone. i didn't know what was going to happen to me. all the while i was still coughing up a lot of blood.

after some time had passed, the nurse with me was starting to panic.

""we need to get him into theatre now!""

they kept trying to give me oxygen but i kept coughing blood into the mask.

my surgeon arrived and i was put to sleep.

i woke up in unbearable pain and agony, it was the worst pain i had felt since this whole thing began. but that quickly changed when i was given morphine.

i rested up and was eventually moved back into the ward and i was greeted by my mum and nan. my poor mother had been through hell. she had only just before it all went down. she was bawling her eyes out the whole time i was going through it all, blaming herself for leaving :(

day 7:

i got a big sleep and i woke up to my surgeon checking in on me. he was truly sorry for my ordeal, and said i was the worst he had ever seen.

the cause was the same as last time, a vessel had opened up and caused the bleeding.

all in all i lost 800ml of blood from that ordeal. that's almost a fifth of total blood!

it's crazy to think that if i wasn't in the ward when it happened there was a good chance i could have died.

day 8-9:

i stayed in hospital. everyone agreed that it was the best place for me, just in case thunder struck three times.

i was pretty shook on day 8 still, but as soon as word got out that it went from standard procedure to almost fatal i was receiving a lot of love from my family and friends.

twitch kept me sane throughout my stay. all my streaming buddies reached out and wished me well which all contributed to making me feel better.

day 10:

i am typing to you all from my phone! this is probably the longest thread i have ever written on reddit and i don't normally post much but i wanted to share my story because this will stick with me for the rest of my life.

each day i'm feeling more and more strong. my pain still sucks but it's getting less severe and i haven't bled since! i'm out of hospital being taken very well taken care of by my mother.

as cliche as it sounds, this whole experience made me very grateful not only for my life, but more importantly the doctors, nurses, surgeons, paramedics etc. that go through so much stress to help us fellow humans live the lives we live.

i can't wait to be back in full health and hopefully i can play some games and get some streams in before i go back to work! ;)

tl;dr: i got the procedure of getting my tonsils out. unfortunately due to complications i needed multiple emergency surgeries. after a few days of rest from the second procedure, i started to bleed excessively. which quickly made me faint turning the hospital into a code red state. i lost a significant amount of blood and i was prepped for a third and final procedure that saved my life.

edit: a small amount of you requested my twitch, here it is: twitch.tv/wristyplum :)

thankyou so much for all the kind words. i really did not expect this to blow up as it has. y'all are so nice!

edit 2: you guys have asked for an update so here it is:

i'm feeling so much better, the pain is no where near as bad! today was the first day i woke up and didn't straight away need painkillers, i'm able to eat whole meals with a side of water to help wash it down. 

my happiness is so high due to the fact that i'm feeling more and more like me again not this zonked out zombie!

i still can't believe how many people this post has affected. my intentions were never for it to go ""viral"" i just wanted to tell my story mostly for me, when it was still fresh in my mind. i could express myself and always look back on this moment in life, but now because of everyone's support and love i'll look back on it in ways i could never imagined!",4

"by coming into work early to try and impress the boss.. i work at a mid size company with around 30 employees, all the employees start at 7 am with the exception of the owner/boss and myself who prefer to start at 6. i have a project coming to a close and promised to have it ready for next monday. i thought it was a good idea to come in a few hours early so 3:30 to get a head start and impress the boss. i show up right at 3:30. i unlocked the door and went to punch in my alarm code..... i completely forgot my code, i've entered it thousands of times and i just forgot. the alarm started going off and simultaneously the phone rang it was the alarm company calling for my code and i couldn't provide it. they ended up calling the owners home phone and he rushed over to turn off the alarm then of course got in an accident with an un-insured driver, had to pay everything out of pocket..... i also missed the deadline.

tldr; went in early to impress the boss, set off the alarm, he came in to turn it off and got in an accident on the way, wasn't impressed.

tl;dr: my teacher asked how you dispose of a bible and i said to burn it because that's the proper method but looked savage

"for those interested in keeping track of their finances in 2017, here's the spreadsheet i use (link in comments). here's the link https://www.dropbox.com/s/g8pzexm6ejbn1dh/finances2017.xlsx?dl=0

hi guys, i shared this sheet a few times on here so wanted to help out again if anyone is interested.

notes on how to use the sheet:

* each row denotes a day, so you can keep track daily. i find it best to do that. i keep my receipts and at the end of the day i quickly add up the total for each category and put it in the correct cell (i also write a comment for each cell so i can remember what it was that i did with that money. ex: if i go out to lunch and dinner i add both totals in the food cell for that day (=5.54+25) and then in the comment i write: breakfast at starbucks, lunch at slater's)

* column j is the monthly totals. halves breaks the month into 2 from the 1st to the 15, and from the 15th to the end of the month).

* the initial row in column n and o are there to put the amount of money in your checking and savings account that you have the morning of the 1st (take into account the money that has not cleared due to the holiday).

* column m is for the description of where the money comes. so if its from your employer you can put work, if its from taxes, you label it taxes and so on.

* column n is for the actual income amount. so if your paycheck is $2,000 after taxes you write that down on the corresponding cell of the day you were paid. 

* then on column o, you can add anything that you pass to your savings account. so if your paycheck was $2,000 and are saving $500 of those, you put the $2,000 in column n, and then the $500 in column o.

* p18 holds a marker for the amount you have available in your checking account, p19 shows your savings, and p20 shows your liquid cash. i keep that near the month i'm on so i can quickly see this amount instead of having to scroll down the sheet and find it there (these are the same amounts as m370, o368 and m368, respectively).

* the boxes labeled net gain in column p show the relationship between the amount you spent that month with the amount you made that month. if its a negative number, you spent more than you made.

* p25 is a rough hourly estimate of how much you are making per month (it's a left over from the days i was paid hourly. the 4.3333 is the 52 weeks divided into 12 months. not the best but its supposed to be a rough estimate).

* row 368 gives you your up-to-date year totals in each category for the expenses. for the income section it gives you your total amount in bank (savings and checking) and then savings and checking amounts individually.

* the monthly payments section starting at b370, simple adds the defined amounts that need to be paid each month, settings a basic expenses monthly total. (this helps me see how much i spend over the basic things i need to pay for)

* in the income section starting in l376 you can change the change the formulas in m377 and m378 to include your jobs' names. this goes with what you put in column m and it keeps track for you of the income per source. 

* the section starting at b379 is the totals from column j neatly organized to see the month expense totals, average, minimums and maximums for each category. you can make some neat charts from this.

* this year i added a new net worth tab to this sheet. i want to thank u/secondnameia who inspired me to do this from this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/55wngb/ive_been_tracking_my_net_worth_for_7_years_xpost/). 
how this works: at the end of the month i look up the amounts in my bank, the value of my stocks, hard assets (house, collectibles, cars, etc.), retirement assets (401k, and any other sort of savings account for this purpose), and the debt i have on credit and add it to the specific month. this will figure out your net worth and give you some percentage data. (this section is still pretty new, but works fine for what i want) (also, for the house, i don't own a house i put my guitars and lego collectables on this section but i'm guessing if you do own a house/houses, you might want to subtract the mortgage amount from the value of the house but i'm really not sure how to go about it for this case)

one thing to note: this chart does not take into account any expenses done with credit cards. i try to avoid those at all costs so i hardly ever have to worry about it. 

let me know if you have any questions and i'll try to explain what the sheet does.

"stop remaking great films and start remaking movies that could have been great, but were poorly executed. all the time we hear stories about films with so much hype but had production issues, cast issues, etc. there's some great scripts that will probably never see the light of day because they were poorly executed on. we should remake those movies instead of ones that have already been executed greatly. 

edit: ppl keep saying studios wouldn't do this so it's useless. dark tower in an example of great source material (steven kings  magnum opus) but the film was godawful. studios could draw back a crowd if it was remade well. hancock is another one - the movie did okay but the original material was so different and in my opinion could have been a lot better. prometheus was an awesome idea but didn't really get as deep as i had hoped. all three of those i think were great ideas, poorly executed that would still make money as a remake if done right. 

edit 2: people also saying this is a popular opinion but i've never walked out of the theater of a bad movie and had someone suggest they give it another go. usually if a movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth your natural inclination isn't to ask for another one. ",6

"i hate when people assume i'm not educated because i work retail.. i graduated with a bachelors degree four years ago. i work retail because it's the only job around in the rural area i'm in while i pay off debt and save up to move elsewhere. 

and there seems to be this prevailing notion that retail is a 'poor man's job,' or one for the uneducated. it really ticks me off. 

baby boomers are the worst offenders. i just had an elderly man come up to me and get in my face (yes, i mean literally) and tell me ""this is a test, like one in college— i mean high school, that's probably as far as you've gotten. where's the honey?"" 

i just looked at him and told him ""aisle one. looks like my bachelors degree is good for something after all."" i said it as cheerfully as i could muster and with a smile. he just blinked and shuffled away, hopefully humbled by the interaction. 

i've had far worse though. i've had people straight up yell at me if i failed high school bc we didn't have something they wanted in stock or if i didn't count change fast enough, as if me having a lower education had anything to do with it. 

there are so many people in retail from all walks of life, of all forms of education. it just grinds my gears when dumb customers try to make assumptions about you or your life. retail workers honestly deserve more than they get, and i wish working retail or fast food was a requirement to teach people how to be humble. 

edit; holy fuck i really didn't expect this to blow up like it has. i made a comment yesterday before i shut off notifications because i was getting overwhelmed but it's comforting to know a lot of folks have dealt with similar situations and i hope my post allowed some people to reach some kind of catharsis by venting their own experiences. 

for the curious, the degree was a b.s. in biology with the intention to teach. i was gung ho when i began only to be completely disheartened and kind of miserable by the time i finished. i realized my heart was elsewhere in computer science. i plan on going back for it eventually, but i'm keeping my chin up during this 'in-between' period while i save up money. thankfully my job pays pretty well and has good benefits so it's not all bad. good pay, same retail gripes. 

anyway, happy holidays! ",11
"gf and i (26m/f) got into a huge fight over a keyboard. thinking about ending things based on her behavior. (x-post r/aita). **update post here**(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqra9h/update_gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/?)

so, my gf and i (both 26) got in a fight about this two nights ago, and she's making it seem like i'm being an asshole. we've been dating for ~4.5 months.

&nbsp; 

my girlfriend has a ~2013 lenovo laptop that has seen better days. as it stands right now, among some other issues, her keyboard totally doesn't work. because of this, she always uses a small bluetooth keyboard with her laptop.

&nbsp;

she had texted me the next morning saying that her wireless keyboard had stopped working as well. we had already planned for me to stay the night at her place after i got off work, so i offered to stop by my place on the way to grab her a keyboard, as i have a few extras.

&nbsp;

when i got to her place, she was eagerly awaiting the keyboard, which makes sense, as she wasn't able to use her computer for most of the day. but when i handed her the keyboard, she started getting really quiet and pouty. a bit later, when i asked her what was wrong, she said she thought i'd be bringing her something nicer, like the keyboard i have at my desk.

&nbsp;

the thing is, i have a really nice keyboard at my desk. i'm a programmer, and i love this keyboard so much that i also bring it to work with me. i even have specific macro profiles for it that definitely improve my workflow.

&nbsp; 

for context, i had an extra amazon basics keyboard  (~$15) lying around, still brand new in the box. my personal keyboard, which i've had for years, is some variant of the razer blackwidow (~$120).

&nbsp; 

anyway, she was apparently expecting me to be 'selfless' and let her use my nice keyboard while i used the amazon keyboard. she was upset that i didn't ""value her enough"" to lend her my nice posessions, and left her with the ""cheap $10 keyboard"" (her words). she said if the situation was reversed, she'd lend me the nice keyboard. i explained to her that i have my keyboard specifically set up for work, and because i'm so used to it, it would hinder my ability to do work if i didn't have it.

 &nbsp;

we continued to argue about it. things really came to a head when she boldly claimed that if i wasn't willing to lend her my nice keyboard, that i ""should have bought her a nice new keyboard if i really cared about her."" this is when i got really mad. i told her she was acting like an entitled, spoiled child and that she should have been grateful that i went out of my way in the first place to grab her the amazon keyboard. she started crying and asked me to go home. i left, but i still gave her the amazon keyboard to use. **i was far more upset at the principle of the situation than the keyboard itself.**

&nbsp;

so now she's calling me an asshole for both not giving her my keyboard and because i called her spoiled. we're going to meet up tomorrow to talk about this in person because i refused to continue this silly argument over text.

&nbsp;

i'm thinking about ending things with her, as i feel like this is her showing me her true colors.

&nbsp;

tl;dr: gfs keyboard broke. i lent her one of my extras, and she got upset that it was a 'cheap' keyboard. i called her spoiled, which infuriated her.

&nbsp;

**edit:** she texted me asking to meet up tonight instead of tomorrow, as she is feeling anxious and stressed about the situation. **i will give everyone an update later tonight or tomorrow morning.**


&nbsp; 

i also wanted to clarify that she's never acted like this before (although, admittedly, we haven't been together for very long). some of you suggested that maybe i'm not making her feel 'valued' and this situation is a symptom of that. while i think i both show and tell her that she's valued in different ways, this may be something i bring up with her. it, of course, doesn't forgive her behavior, but may explain some of it.  cheers.

"for telling my coworker about the reality of a 478 mcat score. the mcat is basically the entrance exam for medical schools in the us. applicants are graded from 472 to 528 based on a percentile. a 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. the median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. you must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.

results for the june 15 exam came out yesterday. this coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. i myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the mcat because i have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. i have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. throughout this process, i have noticed that she didn't have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).

so when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, i took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).  i asked her to reconsider postponing her applications until next year. she had already sent out some primaries but haven't gotten any secondary applications back.

she was in near tears. it feels like i just crushed someone's dreams. she couldn't look me in the eye the rest of the day.

"today i paid off the remainder of my $37000 student loan. originally had a 10 year term but i paid it off in 4. i saved roughly $8000 in interest fees.. 4 years of being out of school and today i had a bit of extra money in my bank account, so i made a lump sum payment and paid off the remaining balance of my loan.  it feels really good.

i used a loan calculator to determine the cost of borrowing for my original 10 year repayment term vs the 4 year term that i ended up with.  there's a difference of about $8000.  that's $8000 that i would have handed over to the bank over the next 6 years had i just made the minimum payments on my loan.

it's something to think about for those of you with loans.  one dollar spent now is one dollar with interest compounded over the remaining life of your loan that you don't have to give away to the bank.  with that thought in the back of my mind, i've been making the decision to delay gratification and pay off my loans with my extra spending money every paycheque. 

i would recommend to people with loans to put a small amount of extra money into your loan every time you get paid.  it doesn't have to be much, maybe only $20-50 if you can afford it, but it does wonders to decreasing the term length of your loan, which in turn saves you a lot of money in the end.

edit: quick note because a lot of people are asking, but my interest rate on the loan was 6.5%. i also have an employer-matched pension that i pay into every month. i think i'd be hard pressed to find an investment with better than a 6.5% guaranteed return.

"advice: accidentally got paid 80 hrs of overtime. i get paid biweekly (924.25) and work 40 hrs a week. i recently got paid for 80 hrs of normal work and 80 hrs of overtime (2075.82). it was someone's mistake working on the payroll. once they realized their mistake, i was paid 0.00 for the next paycheck and 498.60 for the next. a total of 2574.42 for the 3 paychecks. 

i would normally make 2772.75 for 3 paychecks. so this is a difference of 198.33 due to having more taxes taken out of the large amount i was accidentally paid. i've been trying to figure out what to do about it. i would like to be paid the 198.33 but the lady i talked to said the taxes have been paid and there's nothing she can do. 

i've been trying to get this resolved. the people managing my paycheck accused me of intentionally doing this and that i tried to hide the mistake. i notified my boss the day i was paid and we couldn't get in touch with the payroll people for a week. so i don't know if there's nothing that can be done or if they just don't want to do anything. 

should i just let this go? or do i file it when i do my taxes? 

edit: thanks so much everyone! this is my first job/ the first time i will be filing taxes so i just wasn't clear on everything. as long as i'll get it back at the end i'm okay with waiting. i now realize that i was paid the same and taxed differently and there's nothing payroll can do now to fix this. 

edit 2: wow thank you all so much for your input! i'm surprised this got so much attention for such a small issue. i will worry about the 198 when i file my taxes! also i will read everyone's comments tonight and reply to them. 

edit 3: okay so while i was at work i spoke to a lady briefly and she just kept telling me there wasn't anything they could do to fix the problem and the money was already sent away from the initial pay check. my boss was calling me at the same time so i told her i had to go. i haven't gotten the chance to call her back today. i just got an email saying my case number has been closed! (they gave me a case number when i reported a problem) i feel like they're trying to hide something. not exactly my issue but i'm sure they have messed up bigger things in the past and they don't want me to draw attention? i'm okay with just letting all of it go. but it's ridiculous that they closed my case without me getting a chance to talk  ",10
"i think my brother's ex girlfriend has munchausen by proxy. her toddler is becoming more ill. help. thank-you all in advance... this is hamilton, on, canada.

&#x200b;

brief background: my brother began dating a teenaged girl with a toddler last year. i honestly would not have known she had a toddler except for her having mentioned it once. over time, it became more and more clear that this girl is highly manipulative and untruthful. she somehow wormed her way into living with my brother and parents almost immediately, claimed to be going to college + have a part time job nearby. having this girl as part of the family was very confusing: i literally would forget she was there because for hours at a time she would say literally nothing until she told some kind of crisis story, and they always seemed made up. fight with my brother? car crash. my mom annoyed that she was staying over every night? sister came at her with a baseball bat. brother finds out about shocking $50k in debt? baby daddy extorted her and she has no legal recourse. just all kinds of slightly unbelievable shit, but nothing major. this culminated with: brother having misgivings about relationship? ovarian cancer. at this point, i sat my family down and pointed out all the problems in her stories, and voiced my belief that she was neither in college nor had a job, and that she most definitely was making up the cancer (this i knew for sure based on the ridiculous treatment regimen she described). my brother confirmed all 3 of these things, (not before she claimed that they had mistaken a pregnancy for ovarian cancer) and broke it off.

&#x200b;

a sponsored post (sponsored post. for more exposure, people) showed up on my page yesterday. it was a little girl in a full body cast. the little girl looked familiar, and holy shit, it's my brother's ex's daughter. i took the clickbait, and it lead me to the ex's page. her whole profile is full of public posts about her daughter's multiple surgeries, rashes, and gastrointestinal issues. these are some of the most common issues that munchausen's parents report in their children. i'm sure you know by now where i'm going with this. i'm absolutely terrified for that little girl. one of the posts describes ""third degree burns"" caused by ""fungi"" that the doctor found underneath her cast when the mother brought the girl into the emergency room yet again. the whole page is full of selfies with the little girl, and selfies in surgical scrubs. i know i have no evidence, but my gut is telling me that something horrible is happening. she's getting tons of attention for this.

&#x200b;

i called cas, but they were rather testy with me on the phone (can't blame them, i have no proof of this), and said they will follow up with me ""if in the future we receive evidence worth investigating"". my question is, can i somehow alert the doctors that care for her at the local children's hospital? could i get sued for alerting them? is that defamation if i have no proof? i know where toddler gets treated because the mother is always geotagging.

&#x200b;

edit: holy crap this is blowing up. so let me respond to some comments/messages

y u trying to get this kids medical records don't you know anything about hippa

1. i don't want to access this child's medical records, why do you people think i want to do that??? i literally want to make a phone call or two to let someone know about this who will look into it, so i can sleep at night

your brother should deal with this

2) i am not telling my brother about this, it took soooo much energy for him to extricate himself from this situation with this girl

you're biased this poor young woman just trying to do the best for her daughter why do you hate people for wanting the best for their children

3) i have heard more bullshit come out of this woman's mouth than actual truth. of course i am biased. she didn't give a single shit about her daughter until my parents kicked her out and all of a sudden her daughter is greviously ill??? with all kinds of common things that mbp women report to doctors?? i'm concerned!! i could absolutely be wrong! i would be delighted to be!

you think the doctors are stupid they would know

4) no they wouldn't necessarily though?? (c&p from another comment) let me give you an example. a child can get an infected cast in a myriad of ways (kids put their hands in all kinds of things!), but a mother could also put something gross in the cast to infect (under the guise of cleaning, whatever). this would result in an infection that is diagnosed the same whether the child gets it naturally or the mother does it on purpose.",2
"by walking into my son's bedroom without knocking while he was with his girlfriend. my son is 18 and we generally get along pretty well, though he's going through his own life and i'm trying to respect that.

so i came home after work, him after school, i decided to visit his room to ask him what he wanted for dinner and to maybe play some mario kart.

i'm still mortified at what i found...

i walk in, fully clothed my son's girlfriend is on all fours on the bed, my son's face is buried into her butt... she stares at me with the widest eyes i've ever seen and within milliseconds releases what can only be described as the ""horns of the apocalypse"" and farts directly into my son's face. 

he falls backward off the bed, brings down an entire table on top of him, she falls off the front of the bed flipped completely upside down, vertically. he yells ""dad!!"" when suddenly the contents of his entertainment center come crashing down on him.

i rush to his aid, the room smells of some kind of mix of tunafish and hard boiled eggs. my son's pants are down, he's crying and i'm panicking trying to unbury him below the rubble. 

his girlfriend then runs out of the room and heads for the bathroom, all i can hear are explosive noises that could break glass with soundwaves.

my son is bleeding, i haven't said one word at this point. i muster the strength i have to get him to the car for an er visit. i try to get his girlfriend but all i hear from the bathroom is a mix of crying and fart trumpets exploding.

in a moment of weakness i back up and just leave my house locking the door.

my son's alright now, physically anyway. i'll update if he gets pink eye. his girlfriend hasn't contacted us so i can assume she's still going to town. i'm no longer hungry so dinner's out.

tl;dr walked in on my son burying his face into his girlfriend's anus, she farts, he falls off bed and takes down a table and his entertainment center.

**update**

thanks so much for the gold! i originally just wanted to type this out as a literal ""tifu"", as in i felt like i had really screwed up and wanted some support. i misunderstood the humor this subreddit is usually used for; i should have been more discreet with details to say the least. i never anticipated for a second this would grow to this level.

my son is fine, he just ended up with a few scrapes and bruises. i was mainly concerned at the site of blood added by the fact that all the objects falling down on him were pretty heavy game systems, figurine statues and the like.

we haven't spoken much about the incident, but i did pry a few details out, in the least judgmental, kind way i could think to. 

they had the house to themselves, it started with cuddling as she didn't feel very well (obviously) and he admitted he just wanted to ""sniff"" her butt. she was probably reluctant to reveal how she didn't feel very well. we *are* talking, but not much. he's let out a few chuckles and smiles with red face. i realize walking in was a huge violation of privacy, but i am trying my very best to band-aid this. he is aware of the reddit post but doesn't mind.

when we got home the bottom lock on the door was locked and she was nowhere in sight. she hasn't contacted him at all since it happened, but in a few days or whenever she gets back to him i plan on driving him over to see her, and giving her the kindest smile and wave i can muster, all jokes suppressed. 

if any of his gaming stuff is damaged i plan on fully replacing them, and getting him new stuff as an apology.

a few answered questions:

* i did not enter the room with my pants off. i was fully clothed, she was fully clothed, his pants were merely down. i originally typed out the in a hurry while we sat down.

* i'm unsure what caused the massive explosion and upset stomach, but i suspect it was already brewing before i walked in, and she was trying to suppress it when she became a deer in headlights when i walked in.

* i will knock before entering or maybe even call him the next time i get home! i realize now i invaded his privacy pretty heavily.

* the room does still faintly smell, and febreze just lingers in the air with the smell. i suspect she did more than fart on his face...

* no pink eye luckily, either of us, yet

i'll update again if anything worth noting happens",4

"tricky areas with consent in my relationship.. hi everyone!! 

i'm a 17 year old girl stuck in a bit of an uncomfortable mind space. i have a 19 year old boyfriend and we've been best friends since i was 13. we started dating when i was 15, and started having sex pretty much as soon as i turned 16. so, he's a very significant part of my life and has been for a very long time. 

he is kind and patient. he's funny, and we like the same video games and places to go. we have fun and he cares for me a lot. 
he makes me feel loved and sexy. he makes me feel wanted. i love being around him and i care about him so much. 

however, there are a few sexual situations that have made me a bit worried. i haven't been able to discuss them with any real life friends as i really don't want to disrespect my boyfriend or tarnish his reputation. 

these are a few examples of the awkward sex times: 

- he fingered me in the butthole when i asked him not to. he initially asked if i wanted him to pop a finger in, to which i adamantly said no to, and he put it in anyway. i told him to stop and to get out but he just kept fingering me. i froze and he finished and afterwards i told him how i didn't want him to and he joked about it. he continues to do it in sex. 

- he came inside me when i asked him not to. i have an iud so i'm usually totally fine with having him cum inside me but i had a new one placed and my gynaecologist told me to use condoms while my body adjusted. we compromised and agreed on the pull out method. when he was about to cum, he asked me what i wanted, and i requested he pull out. then he asked again and i reaffirmed it. then he kept having sex with me before saying that he was cumming inside me. i asked him to pull out but he just kept at it. i cried after sex. he made jokes about it afterwards. i brought it up a few days later and told him it upset me and he said he felt like a real piece of shit for it and i ended up comforting him. 

- said i didn't want to have sex when he woke me up at 3am for it, as i felt sick. he then got quite upset with me until i sort of felt like i had to say yes to avoid him being angry with me or him having issues with me? we fucked even though i felt like i was going to spew and he knew how poorly i was. 

- wanted to do anal. i didn't want to. got me really drunk to try it. it hurt and i asked him to stop. he asked me to keep trying. i said it hurt. he stopped. 

these are a few examples. i'm not sure how well my semi illiterate brain is at communicating these events but i've just sort of been worrying about them.

i tend to get a bit anxious during sex because it feels very out of my control. i feel like he could do anything and if i said no, it wouldn't really matter. this is such a frustrating way to feel because he's such a good and kind lover.

he's so caring towards me particularly when i'm dealing with the symptoms to a chronic illness i have, and tries hard to make me happy. 

we get along so well and i really want to be a good partner sexually for him. 

should i be more open sexually? should i let him try more things? 
if it's not an issue with me, how should i communicated it to him? 
he knows that the sex when i was sick made me feel pressured and that it upset me that he came inside me when i requested he didn't. he doesn't know that the fingering thing made me feel a bit sad. is it worth bringing up again or should i just be more firm?

please help! i've no idea if i'm not being good enough and i don't want to hurt him. i need advice! i don't have anyone else to turn to about it.  

tldr: my boyfriend is amazing and i love him but sex gets a little bit sad for me sometimes. am i doing something wrong?

"a priest and a rabbi are very good friends, so they decide to go to a remote lake for a swim.. of course they're swimming naked as you do. all of a sudden, two busses pull up. out of one pours the rabbis congregation and out of the other pours the priests congregation. their clothes are on the other side of the lake so they don't have time to retrieve them, they just have to make a run for it. the priest, running with his hands covering his genitals looks over at the rabbi and sees him running with his hands over his face. he says, ""rabbi! what are you doing!"" the rabbi says, ""in *my* community, they recognise me by my face.""",0
"by helping a friend. a friend knocked on my door today. i don't know him too well, he's the father of one of my son's friends. he seemed quite urgent, so i let him in. he asked if i had a scanner, as he needed something scanned and emailed to him straight away. i sure did!

i invited him into my office. placed the first page into the scanner. sat down. opened my graphics software, and declared ""it's easy! watch!"".

unfortunately the software displayed the last image i was working on; a close-up of my erect penis.

it was a decent photo actually. great lighting. good composition. a nice angle, too! i don't have many of those pics, i just took one recently as someone asked for it, and uncharacteristically, i felt like obliging.

two thoughts went through my head;

1. close it (which i did)
2. will he think i've been checking out dick pics, and that i'm gay?!

now, #2 is not an issue. i am not, and i don't care if anyone thinks i am. however... recently he's been inviting me to a lot of kids' events, and asking questions like ""are you dating?"", ""what do you think of helen?"" (name changed for privacy reasons). so i've been wondering if he is that way inclined, and perhaps had his eyes on me....

so... i then compounded things.

to stop him thinking that i'd been looking a close-up pics of other men's penises.. i confidently said ""that was me!"".

he looked around, said ""i think someone called me"", and left.

&#x200b;

edit: there have been a lot of questions! so here are some clarifications;

1. i didn't scan my penis. i scanned his paper documents.
2. i took the photo of myself with a dslr+tripod
3. the photo editing i did on the photo of myself was limited to cropping (removing background stuff) and resizing the image itself (from \~4000px to \~2000px).
4. all 3 people mentioned in this story are single. we all live in the same townhouse complex.
5. the software i use (paint.net) is used both for the editing (cropping, resize) and for acquiring images from my flatbad scanner
6. no, unless we have a pre-existing relationship, you can't see the photo. thanks for asking, though!
7. this happened at my home office. 

tl;dr accidentally showed a neighbour a close-up photo of my erect penis, then proudly said ""that was me!""",4

"i've been in a relationship with an older man for over a decade that started when i was a minor. i need help.. this is a throwaway account for what i assume will be obvious reasons. this will be an epic post. it's taken me almost 13 years to tell this story to anyone.

when i was 15 i joined an online community. i used it to vent about typical teenage-angsty topics: family, friends, school, etc. i should be clear it wasn't specifically geared toward teens and actually i think the majority of users were in their 20s and older. 

on this site i ""met"" a man in his late 20's who i will refer to as adam. adam and i got to know each other over the course of a few months via long chats and emails. we ended up in a virtual relationship. by this i mean i considered him my boyfriend. he considered me his girlfriend. this relationship included cyber sex, but we never sent each other sexy pictures until i was over 18. we both knew this was legally wrong but of course i was 15 and didn't care. i don't remember what his justification was. i thought he was my soul mate.

adam was absolutely my first love. during our ""relationship"" he would write epic poems and essays about his love for me and how wonderful i was. it was stuff that even now (i am now in my late 20s) i would find incredibly romantic and beautiful if it were in an appropriate context. we called each other our soul mates. we planned for our futures together, including children's names. it was an intense relationship by any definition, but especially for a 15 year old girl.

eventually we ""broke up"" after almost a year because he found out i was dating someone in real life. he said i broke his heart. he was devastated. i was devastated that i had hurt him.

the years passed and even though we were no longer ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" we never stopped talking. i always considered him one of my best friends. i grew up, dated other guys, graduated high school, went to and graduated from college, eventually got married and even had a baby. he meanwhile met another woman online, moved in with her, and has been married to her for several years. during this time we go through cycles of getting close, declaring our love for each other, making promises to be together, then getting frustrated and drifting apart. this has been going on for almost 13 years. i'm exhausted.

i've also tried to meet him several times over the years (after i turned 18) but any time we got close he would fall through. the most recent time was early 2016. we live in different states and had planned to meet halfway. i arrived at our meeting spot, several hundred miles away from home, and he chickened out. told me he couldn't come, couldn't make an excuse to his wife that she would believe. then he stopped answering my phone calls. i was furious, embarrassed, and devastated. i thought that was the end of our relationship but somehow we moved past it and continued our friendship/relationship/cycle of codependency. 

so why am i now writing this? why now, after 13 years of this cycle of on-again, off-again? i think i'm just tired. i had a baby not too long ago with my husband who, despite everything i've said here, i dearly love and cherish. i recognize that my relationship with adam is destroying my ability to be intimate with him and with other people. i'm just so used to keeping this secret. in all my friendships/relationships in the pas 13 years i have never told anyone about adam. he has always been a secret. at first it was to protect him and then later i think because i was just ashamed.

tonight i decided i have to stop the cycle. i contacted a therapist and i'm going to tell her what i've told you all. i hope this is the beginning of a new, healthier chapter.

thanks for listening.",12

first of all, thank you to everyone that responded to my original post. i tend to be very oblivious to people hitting on me and seeing reddit mostly in agreement helped convince myself i wasn't completely crazy.

now onto the important part: reddit was right- it was a netflix and chill situation. thankfully he messaged me a few hours before we were due to meet up and made it extremely clear that he was interested in me. i truly appreciated him making his intentions known and it set the tone for our night- no awkward ""is he going to make a move?"" to worry about. i'm not going to go into details but i thoroughly enjoyed our time together and can't wait to see him again. :)

"my boss offered my friend a $6 raise, after only giving me a $1.5 raise. how do i ask for more money?. i have been working for the same company for 2 years now. every year you make at the company you have a review where you get a raise. only people that work ""full time"" are eligible. 

the first year that i was working there, i was working ""part-time"", which really just means i didn't have benefits, because i was still working almost 40 hours a week. i started working ""full time"" when i made my first year, which meant that i did not get a review for my entire full year. it's been a year of me being full time and i had my first review and i left with a $1.5 raise. 

a couple of months ago i referred my friend to the job because we were short people. long story short she has been here 5 months, and she found/was offered a job at another office for $6 more an hour. when she put in her two weeks to leave for the new job, my current boss counter offered her to match the pay for her to stay. so now my friend who has only been working there for less than 6 months got a $6 raise, while i only got a $1.5 raise after two years of working for this company. 

while i'm really happy for my friend (i'm not blaming her at all), i can't help but to feel cheated and undervalued by the company. we technically have the same job, (but i'm practically managing my own office alone) and i don't know what to do or how to handle this situation.

my mind logs this as odd, somewhere in the back of my brain, and moves on with the tutorial, my father-in-law finishes his coffee and heads back out to my car.

i return to cleaning up his pc and scans, etc find a few things that are tied back to a bunch of bdsm / fetish porn sites, spanking videos, etc.

now normally, after a decade of dealing with people's pcs, i have a very ""no judgements"" stance with this sort of stuff. at least the ebay searches for riding crops make sense... 
but my mind chose that moment to remind me that my wife has (somewhat) recently revealed that she's kinda into that sort of thing. we recently had a ""dirty weekend away"", where she revealed that she had recently purchased an assortment of paddles, whips, restraints, and things that vibrate (thanks fifty shades... i guess...?)

if macy's will not issue a return, can i file for a chargeback under 'not as described'(https://chargebacks911.com/knowledge-base/product-not-as-described-chargebacks/), since these were sold as regular dress shoes? would this affect my credit, and how long would it take for a return? or am i better off just eating the purchase and buying elsewhere.

update: good news everyone! the manager processed my return. frustrating it took a half hour of my time, but here we are. learned a few good finance lessons:

she knows she's not great, and she's been trying for years to get better. but she starts out following a recipe, gets confused or lazy, and starts making crazy substitutions and changes. goddammit woman, broiling and boiling are not synonymous and you can't just replace allspice with all the spices! 

but when she's slaved over something for hours, and she's looking at me like she does, i don't have the heart to say that her cooking is shit on a plate. so i tell her she's getting better, swallow a few mouthfuls, then pretend to run a few errands so i can grab some fast food.

luckily she works later then me so i usually have dinner going before she can gets home. if she offers to help i tell her that she needs to put her feet up. i'm a pretty good cook, so most nights are fine. it's just anniversaries, holidays, or other big days that bring out her sudden desires to cook.

my wife is pretty much perfect in every other way, so i don't want to hurt her. but i've got to get this off my chest here:

honey, you're quite possibly the worst cook in the world and it should be illegal for you to even try. i love you, but for god's sake woman, put away the oregano and step away from the kitchen before anyone gets hurt.",12

i had a really productive trip, met the entire team, and made a really great impression. upon the advice of a couple of folks, i just rode it out and enjoyed the time there.

using some of that same advice, i was able to negotiate the pay i wanted and **i got the job**! just signed the offer about ten minutes ago.

"light i love my dead end job, small car and tiny house.. growing up i always felt i needed to do something big, become a doctor or the next big game designer, get a big house and nice car. i always had the general mentality that i would need to go to university to be successful etc. 

i dropped out of uni a couple of years ago and decided to work my ass off in a factory and get some savings under my belt (with the help of living with parents). 

i bought myself a small car which i love. it's a corsa, the most generic first time buyer car there is. i decked it out with a nice sound system which makes driving so fun. 

i quit the job at the factory which was making me miserable (long physically intensive, 6 day weeks) and decided to become a pizza delivery guy. i love every second of it. being in the uk i get minimum wage, petrol money (which works out it covers my personal use too) and tips on top. 

i basically drive round, listen to music and podcasts and eat pizza. i am very introverted as well, i love the independence and solitude. my boss is chill too so that makes everything easier. i don't work until later on in the day, so i have my daytimes free and i'm a bit of a night owl anyway. 

i have a small house that i've filled with my hobbies and things i like. i have some savings, and even with the job i have i still manage to add a little to it at the end of each month. 

i'm happy to do this job as long as i can, i don't need a lot of money, i don't want kids. i feel like people are going to judge me for the choice i've made but i'm happy, fuck the rat race.",12

"i quit my job because people are gross. gross, don't read if gross body stuff and roaches make you queasy. so i loved my job as a pest control tech. i had so much fun helping people with their problems. well one day i was working at an apartment complex. this complex is in a college town so it was mostly students. well i am about 14 apartments in when i go into an apartment. there were some clothes on the floor. not to dirty. i find roach droppings in the living room. i was unhappy about that as it meant i needed to really lay the boric acid down. its just time consuming and i wanted to get home for a date night with my wife.

well i start finding roaches so i start killing and removing them with a shot vac. 
ok, so there are pictures of the person living in this apartment. she is a smoking hot girl. i mean hot hot. of course she has photos of herself everywhere.

so from the kitchen i go and eradicate in the living room. then the bathroom, and finally her bedroom. i walk in and theres clothes everywhere. pants, shirts, jackets, underwear, etc. so i'm killing and vacuuming. out of the corner of my eye i see movement. i look and see a big american roach. its on a white nightstand drawer. i run over to get it with the vac but it goes into the drawer. without even thinking i open the drawer to get him.

well, the drawer is filled with roaches and sex toys. yup, sex toys and they weren't cleaned very well. they had dry vaginal fluid i suspect on them. they were covered with roaches eating the dry flakes on the toys. there were dirty buttplugs as well. while that bothered me it was the smell that knocked me for a loop. i have pulled dead rotten animals out of 100+ degree attics and this smelled worse. i threw up in my mouth. ran towards the bathroom hitting the door frame with my shoulder. i hit it so hard i fell back sideways and then ran into the bathroom.

 after throwing up everything i ever ate. i went back in and vacuumed up the roaches but dust around the table. not on the toys because that would be bad and gross(sarcasm). 
i didn't go home after work. nope i went to the emergency room because my shoulder turned purple and hurt like crazy. fortunately it was just a bad bruise.

i lost my stomach for my work and called in sick for 2 days. then quit. i never told anyone why. never told anyone about the gross hot girl. now i kind of regret it and miss it. oh well. 
seriously wash your sex toys, you don't want to get sick.

edit: wow so that's what its like to have your inbox killed. sorry for not warning that its gross. i will add that now. also paragraphs!

"possibly over-reacting at my wife's ""mistake"" by leaving the house for a week. i know relationship posts aren't allowed here so i want to keep this focused to the incident at hand. so please don't give any relationship advice.

okay, so i am a big fan of seinfeld as i used to watch it every day after school with my dad. i had a poster that was signed by the actors who played the four main characters jerry, kramer, costanza, and elaine. this poster has always been really important to me because watching seinfield with my dad is one of the few times i got to spend time with him (he had a lot of personal issues) and he personally went and got it signed to give me for my 21st birthday. so yeah, it's not just a dumb poster to me, it has a lot of sentimental value.

now my wife and i have been trying to raise money to start a college fund for our kids. as you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and i guess you can see where this is going. i hadn't been in my study a few weeks as i've been on an extended business trip, and when i come home to my study my poster is gone. i ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on ebay.

here's where it gets iffy. she claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, despite it being so sentimental to me. the reason i am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. she tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure i behave myself). however i couldn't say no, i literally had to go or i'd severely hurt my reputation at work. so when i leave we're fighting, when i come back my most prized possession is gone in a ""mistake."" see where i'm coming from?

i told my wife i was going to stay in a motel for 1-2 weeks, and that if she wants to save this marriage my poster better be back in my study when i get back. she's supposedly been an emotional wreck ever since (according to her sister).

"i m 26 am getting married soon. need advice on keeping stalkerf 25 away. hello,

using throwaway because family knows my username.

&#x200b;

so back in 2017 i had met a girl on tinder. we texted for two months before we met. we had told each other we weren't looking for serious relationships (which is kinda why i agreed to meet her in the first place - i was not in a frame of mind to get into a relationship.). hooked up the first time we met. following day she told me she was in love with me and asked if we could date, to which i said no. 

long drawn fights, a lot of gaslighting, manipulation, crying followed in the subsequent weeks over texts (which i documented) and calls (which i recorded). she told me she was depressed, suffered child abuse, was sexually assaulted and that's the source of her rage. she started threatening me with suicide. i caved and continued to talk to her on a condition that she remains platonic. we did not meet in person, but she sent me > 50 texts daily and would call every alternate day. i played along, thinking she will lose interest soon but that did not happen. she asked three more times if we could get into a relationship and three times i said no. of course, the logical inconsistency with her saying she will keep it platonic and asking for a relationship went unnoticed because i was just too chicken, too scared, to say anything, thinking she might hurt herself.

after a while this started to affect me and work started to suffer. i tried to distance myself from her. after about 4 months after meeting her, she asked me to meet her again as a birthday present. i refused. she lashed out at me. i told her the ""friendship"" was not going to work this was and i changed my phone number, deleted all my social media and alerted friends. she then contacted a handful of my friends (who she probably figured out from social media), colleagues and started a smear campaign. she also made suicide threats, but did not receive any detectable response. she then showed up at my workplace, and a colleague sent her back telling her that i have quit. i passed on a message through one of the colleagues she called, saying i want no further contact. she keeps listening to some music i upload  - spends hours at times - which is how i know she hasn't completely forgotten me yet. however, last she tried to contact me directly was over a year ago.  

i subsequently found out i am not the first person she did this to. one of the previous victims even works for the same employer as i! there have been at least 4 guys she has done the same thing to.

\clearly i am skipping details, but i don't believe these are important\

i am a guy in india, so there is no provision for me to complain against her - the law thinks indian men cannot get stalked and harassed. so legal action is not possible. she lives in the same city.

i met a wonderful person by end of 2018 and we got engaged recently. we are getting married soon. what all precautions should i be taking?

"usa-ny 24 year old male. my doctor called and told my mother he treated my genital warts. i had one genital wart removed and my insurance covered it fully. later my doctor kept pushing for a skin biopsy on my chest that was completely irrelevant to my genital wart. 
i finally agreed and signed the paper after he told me how risky it could be for cancer. he performed the procedure but the nurse forgot to verify that the insurance is covering it. i understand i need to pay because i signed paperwork saying i'd be responsible if my insurance didn't pay. 

however he called my mother introducing himself as the doctor who treated my genital warts. then he goes on to tell her he needs a few thousand dollars for the procedure. 

is that even legal? i thought he wasn't allowed to reveal another condition unless it comes down to the insurance not paying. 

i literally told the doctor my family couldn't know about the wart and he tried to use it against me to scare me and my mom into paying immediately. my insurance kicked me off for doing so many unnecessary procedures with this guy. he would convince me everything could potentially be cancerous. 

i understand it's my fault for not doing my research and being gullible so i'll have to pay for that. however i'm pretty upset he had to tell my mom about my sti condition when there was no issue with the billing. he was paid and it was done over a year ago. it was completely irrelevant to his call to collect. he called to collect from a skin biopsy of a mole on my chest. 

i'm so frustrated because now my family thinks i'm a guy living with aids and i sleep with dirty hookers.

"i can't go to my barbershop anymore because i'm a liar. so today i went to get a haircut. when you get there you have to write your name down so they can call you. while i was sitting there on my phone, a barber had apparently been calling my name a few times until i finally looked up and said ""sorry, i didn't hear you"" then as i went to go sit in his chair i heard the other barbers and some customers laughing, i felt really embarrassed and dumb, it's already hard enough being in a place with so many people. so as i'm getting the haircut i kept thinking about what i should say to the barber so he doesn't think i'm an idiot who doesn't respond to his own name. so after he as done with the haircut i said ""sorry i didn't hear you earlier, i have a hearing problem"" and as soon as i said it i saw the guilt on his face which made me feel guilty too because i was lying. so long story short, i can't go to that barbershop anymore because it's associated with a nasty lie and i can't keep pretending to have a hearing problem. it's a shame because they're the best barbers in my area and they're cheap.

"went to visit my grandma one day, went into wrong room, been visiting elderly lady ever since.. 



edit : unfortunately it isn't a good one, my friend passed away two days ago guys and i'm trying to think of a way to explain to my 3 year old that we won't see her again, she just lost her cat a week ago and was devastated and keeps asking if she is coming back tomorrow, so i'm struggling but when i do tell her i'm going to just be honest. 
i have the amazing memories with my accidental friend which will be forever in my heart because she has taught me so much without even knowing it.
her family live far away and have asked me to start sorting through her things and given me permission to see her at the funeral home and start making arrangements, i think they kind of wrote her off when she had gotten sick which is sad. i'm going to do my  best for her. i know her favourite songs, her favourite outfit and the lipstick she always wore, so i'm going to sort all of that over the next few days.
i feel extremely sad but also grateful i got to experience this kind of unexpected bond and feel as though we were placed together for whatever reasons to help us both.
i'm sad my kid probably won't remember, but we have dozens of pictures to look at.
thanks again everyone for being so kind, i'm just sorry it's such a sad update.

so this is probably the wrong place to post this but i'm new to posting, here's what took place..

this was 11 months ago. my husbands grandma (i call her grandma because we're extremely close and she's one of the best people i know) lives in an assisted living place, the rooms have the same layout in each one and same decor unless the occupant has changed it. my grandma had been there about two months by this time and i had been to see her each week but she had been in hospital for the past few weeks and was having her room decorated whilst she was there. 
me and my daughter also have the same routine, we go in using my door fob, we wait for the lift and she's presses the button to my grandmas floor. this day i was on a call to work and wasn't paying enough attention, so we get out of the lift and the decor in the hallway is different, it's been painted pink and me and my kid are like wow it looks so good here, we trot along down the hall to my grandmas room and knock, a lady answers and we say hi and go in, i thought it must be my grandmas friend (she has a lot) so we take our shoes off and go into the living area.
this is when i realise that shit! we're in the wrong room. what happened is my kid had pressed floor 2 in the lift rather than 1. it hadnt been decorated, but had always been that way, i just hadn't visited that floor before. 
i was just about to explain my mistake when the lady ushers us to sit down and says how great it is us to see us as it had been so long and she had been lonely. my kid has started playing with her fridge magnets by this time so when she asked if i wanted a cup of tea i agreed. we chatted about a lot, and i ended up staying for 40 minutes and helping her set some things to record. she loved us being there and adored my kid so i didn't want to break her heart and tell her we had never actually met. we hugged as we left and i went down to speak to the staff and let them know what had happened, in case the lady told them or her family she'd had visitors and gotten confused.
they proceeded to tell me that she doesn't get many visitors, her family live the other side of the country, she's widowed, has dementia and the only person who regularly visits is her husbands brother. turns out she was a hospital matron until she was 61. she is now 82.
to this day, i still visit the friend i made accidentally that day. her and my grandma fast became friends afterwards, and we all eat lunch together once a week. she provides me with wisdom, lots of laughs and hugs and a lot of cake. i fix things for her. help with whatever she needs doing in her place and accompany her to doctors appointments.
my daughter adores her, and we take her to get her hair set every few weeks. she spends family time with us, we cook, we watch antiques roadshow and she's teaching me to knit. 
she does believe i am family, and i'm ok with that because she feels like family to me. 

i'm so glad i was being a shitty parent that day and my kid pressed the wrong button.

edit; thank you so much for all of the replies, and whoever gave me gold/silver. i didn't expect it.
for all the people saying they wish they could befriend an elder, i say go for it! yes, i have provided my friend with company and happiness but honestly she's given me so much too, she's unbelievably wise and she listens intently. you don't find that with many people anymore! she cares deeply about me and my kid. i honestly believe that some things are supposed to happen to lead us in a certain direction and this day is one of those times! it's her birthday this weekend so we are going to the restaurant where her husband used to take her.
really appreciate all the love, thank you!!! 

edit 2; just wanted to again say thank you to all of you. makes me so happy people are so kind. thank you for all the love/ responses",11

"i've been wearing women's underwear for six months to keep my wife oblivious to the fact that i cheated on her. . i've been having a long-term affair with a young woman who works for me that is still ongoing. i know reddit likes to crucify cheaters, but my wife cut me off sexually years ago with no regard for how hurt and rejected this has made me. and yes, i have tried everything to fix it. she refuses therapy. she sees nothing wrong with her having no libido and doesn't understand why my hand doesn't suffice. hence, i get my physical intimacy needs met elsewhere. and i refuse to divorce because i want to see my children every day. with that out of the way...

six months ago, i had purchased a few pairs of sexy panties for my girlfriend. i had them all, i thought, safely stuffed into my jacket pocket. however, one must've slipped loose when i left for work that morning, because when i came home i found my wife sitting on the couch with the most furious look on her face and one of the pairs of panties sitting on the coffee table. my wife just looked at me as i looked down at them then slowly stalked off to our bedroom. 

i don't know why the idea came to me, but it hit me as soon as she left the room and i knew i had to act immediately and that i had to be quick and silent. thankfully, my girlfriend had been out sick at work and i still had the other two pairs of panties in my jacket pocket. 

quick as a flash and quiet as a ninja, i stepped out of my shoes and dropped my trousers. then i whipped off my boxers and stuffed them under the couch. then i squeezed my big ass into one of the pairs of panties, yanked my trousers back up and stepped back into my shoes. 

it was honestly impressive. i bet i got undressed and redressed in all of five seconds before i was headed up the stairs after my wife. 

i found her sitting on the bed, still looking furious. i said, in my most soothing tone, ""honey, it's not what it looks like.""

then i dropped my pants and let my wife see me, her six foot fall husband, in little pink panties as if i had been wearing them from the moment i walked in the door. 

we had a long talk after that. my wife was confused, and a little hurt, that i'd never confessed my supposed fetish to her, but it was minor compared to the fury of earlier. in the end, she was perfectly accepting of it and encouraged me to continue to do so if it made me happy, but never to hide it from her and to not let our children know.

"my friend gave me a pet who died in the next day. i never told him and i pretend to have the same pet.. disclaimer: english is not my first language, so...

during my early teens i was best friends with a guy who had a couple of cockatiel's (domestic birds). i, an obssessed animal person, used to say that i would die for one of these birds  since i found them so pretty. lo and behold: in my 15th birthday my friend gave me one sweet baby cocktiel.

i was so happy with my baby bird, however i didn't had the tools to properly take care of it since my family and i didn't know we were getting one. also, i didn't know how i felt about domestic birds since they don't get to be free in nature (even though they don't know how to survive in the wild).

the first hour of my cocktiel at home was stressful  since my oldest dog didn't love the idea of a new family member and was trying to kill it in every opportunity. after some time, things got calmer and my mom had the idea of leaving the baby bird locked in the bathroom, so my dog couldn't find it. we were planning to get a birdcage and a bunch of cocktiel's toys in the next day so our baby would be comfortable.

next day in school, i was telling my friend how much i loved his gift and he told me about his own birds. he really loved them, and for him to give me one was a big demonstration of affection. i felt pretty great about my relationship with him and the cocktiel was a symbol to our love. he wasn't a guy who expressed feelings with words and at that point (us being friends for 10 years) he giving me the cocktiel was the first time he expressed that he trusted me.

so, it is the second day of my baby bird home and i notice that she was (yea, i decided that she was a girl) getting pretty smart around the bathroom, jumping next to the toilet and bathroom box. i didn't thought about that much since i was getting her birdcage soon, but warned my brother to always leave the toilet seat down, afraid that she was going to slip and fall in the water. then, i went to my afternoon class.

when i returned home, first thing i went to do was check my little cocktiel. yeah, you guessed it. she was dead. drowned in my brother's piss. he forgot to leave the seat down. i had a full breakdown, tried to ressuscitate her but no success. and then i thought about my friend and freaked out even more. i begged while crying to my mother to fix things.

the day after her death i wasn't in school, i went to my local pet shop and bought a baby cocktiel, now with a birdcage and all. i couldn't brought myself to tell my friend that my cocktiel had died in my brother's urine. my friend visited my house regularly so a new baby cocktiel was the only option for me. this happened years ago, i never told my friend the truth. only me, my mom and my brother knows that our cocktiel is a fraud.

"for telling my ex i refuse to share custody of our daughter?. my ex an i have an incredibly long history. we met when i was 18 and he was 19. he was my first love and we dated about a year. but after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until i turned 23. which was also the same time i found out i was pregnant...

he was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when i found out. he also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. i got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

when i found out i was pregnant i told him immediately. he was very very angry and asked what i was going to do about it. i told him i'd be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child's life because it was going to ruin everything for him. i told him that wasn't an option. 

i myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it's a big stem of my mental illnesses now. all things he knew.

after begging him to be in the baby's life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. they offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if i never forced him to be a real father. his parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

at first i said no. i refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best i take the offer. they told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. i finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

i took sole custody of course. it's been 7 years and i had a beautiful baby girl that i love more than anything on earth. every single month i get a check and not once has it ever been late. i haven't seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. until about a week ago. 

i get a call and it's my ex. he tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. the daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! i was infuriated and told him no. he told me that i can't just say no because he's gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

i was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. he told me he was sorry but he's ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. when i told him i was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me i was being ridiculous and i need to grow up. 

i've told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me i need to give him a chance and that i'm just being a bitch. the only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when i was a child. i know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but i just feel like i need to fight this. for being so against him getting any custody?

edit: for all the people that are confused about age. we met in late teens. got pregnant when i was 23 and he was 24. i'm 30 now and he's 31.

edit2: for all the people that are saying i'm ta for not getting an abortion. thanks! but i remember asking if i was an ass for telling my ex i'll fight him over custody. please stop telling me i should have aborted my 7 year old daughter. it's very much too late and i never asked for your opinion on that matter.",3

we've been dating for two years. we're planning to move in together. 

she's never met my parents, and it's starting to become obvious that i'm putting it off. 

i keep putting it off, because i know my parents won't like her. 

my parents have very antiquated views about what a woman should be and one of those things is thin. my girlfriend has an eating disorder, she is 5'2 and roughly 200 pounds. 

my family thinks if a woman is overweight it means she's infertile, self centered (doesn't care if her man finds her attractive), inactive, poor impulse control, and not a contributing member of society, i could go on and on. 

first of all, my girlfriend has been an athlete her whole life and competed at a national level all through college. she went to an ivy league school, graduated with latin honors, and is the youngest person to ever have the job she has where she works. 

she's unfucking believable. 

she's so used to being the best and succeeding at things that her weight is a major sticking point for her and something she is very sensitive about. 

i don't know how to handle it with my parents if they make a comment (they did it to my brother's old girlfriend, no reason to believe it won't happen again) or if they're just generally hostile. 

i've told her my parents are from a different time and place and are very sexist and whether or not they like her will have no bearing on how i view her but i still don't know how to handle this. 

my girlfriend really wants my family to like her since we're going to move in together and i don't know what to do about this. 

usually we talk things out very directly but her eating disorder stems from a traumatic period in her life so discussing it has to be handled carefully and i'm not sure how to basically say ""my parents are kind of morally bankrupt in some ways"" without ruining any chance of a relationship between the three of them. 

should i call my parents beforehand and tell them if they plan to be rude they'll just never meet her? or tell my girlfriend if something happens she has my blessing to say ""go fuck yourself"" and walk out? or something else entirely? i'm freaking out about this. 

*tl;dr: my girlfriend is overweight, i don't care at all, she wears it well and is a perfect 10. i've been putting off introducing her to my parents because i know they'll make a huge deal out of it and embarrass her. we're moving in together and i can't put off introducing them. how do i head this off?*

thanks for the gold!",7

"(texas) dealership gave repo company my vin instead of the correct one. wake up and car is gone. my car is paid in full.. i purchased a car 6 days ago, i've been waiting for years to buy and i've loved it so far, until this morning. the auto group that sold it to me called me and explained to me on friday that they had accidentally given the repo company the wrong vin. 
         
same car, wrong vin. so i've been parking it in the  back where hopefully the tow truck would be too big to fit in the tight space but i guess they pulled it off cause now my baby has disappeared.

  where do i start off? i'm pretty livid that this happened 3 days after he said he tried to contact them.

update 1 the general manager just called and asked if they seriously came and took it after they left a ton of messages to the tow company to not to take the car. he said whatever is wrong with it will be made right and he quickly got off the phone to jump someone's ass about the situation. let's see how this goes.

update 2 i'm considering asking for my money back from the car, the warranty i purchased, my first months car insurance, and for them to pay for a rental while i find my replacement. they royally screwed up and i don't want to deal with the headache of them having to fix the car and it possibly never being the way it was.

edit: just to add the car in question is a 2011 cadillac cts-v coupe. so hopefully my worries about it being damaged heavily are more easily recognizable.

edit 3: called the police and they told me it's a civil issue (go figure) and i talked with my attorney. he told me i have grounds for a full refund but i should have the car professionally inspected by a reputable cadillac dealership and find out the damage and how much to make it right first and make a decision there. he says it's complicated for who is to blame because of the scenario. i'm going to contact another police department and see if i can get an official report and call the repo company and inform them of the mistake just in case the dealership hasn't. the last contact with the dealership was over 3 hours ago. still with no news to the whereabouts of my car. i had to find it myself.

big update after contacting the tow yard they told me the dealership never paid for the car or after they got it from auction, so there was still a lein on the car so i basically bought a stolen car from the auction. i cannot deal with them after this. this is the shadiest thing i've ever been a part of and i'm dumbfounded i've found myself here. 

another edit so they're trying to work with the finance company to get my car taken care of but it turns out my car wasn't the only one affected. this is happening to multiple cars all purchased through this company and i'm not going down without a fight. i'm getting out if this deal, it's way too hot for me.

update 6 dealer says they had bought the car on a ""floor plan"" which he explained is how they use the bank to buy a few cars from auction all at once. they closed this and paid the bank but the lein still exists until its sold and the automated system didn't pick it up that the car had sold and only saw a title transfer so it assumed i had taken it and just retagged it as mine. the dealer has offered me a loaner and says the car will be back tomorrow. he told me they could refund the deal if it really comes down to it but i would lose the money i spent paying taxes on it which is understandable. i'm gonna have the car professionally inspected and see if there's any damage and i'll decide then on how i want to proceed. this has been a roller coaster today.

edit thoughts they say the car will be back tomorrow and i can use a loaner for however long but after finding it's been through auction i'm not sure on trust the car itself. i'm sitting on a spiky fence of letting my dream car go back and getting  my money back and finding another or just making the dealer fix the car. i feel like this is going to be a long road for me. i've missed a day of work and haven't come any closer to finding my car. i miss it so much",2

"my girlfriend cries at night and it breaks my heart. should i tell her i know that?. throwaway account because i feel more comfortable this way.

so, my girlfriend (21) and i (24) have dated for a year before we moved together a few months ago. she likes to sleep by herself sometimes so she moves to the couch and sleeps there. ≈a month ago we were sleeping separately again and when i woke up in the middle of the night because apparently my organism wanted some water, i heard some sobbing from the room where my girlfriend was sleeping. at first my sleepy brain didn't actually recognise those sounds as crying, but after focusing on them for a few minutes it was obvious for me that she was crying. the next day she looked as if nothing happened, we slept togeher and i decided not to talk about it with her. it happened again next week, when i just couldn't sleep and heard her sobbing when she was on the couch.
i figured she cries every night spends on the couch and at this point i don't really know if i should tell her i know about it.
it's worth mentioning that she's depressed and she really doesn't like showing her negative feelings or vulnerabilities and i'm afraid that if i tell her she's going to feel embarrassed or ashamed and won't talk about it again. she sees a therapist as well but i don't think it helps. she's a great person and i really love her, but that thing is killing me and i don't know what to do to make her feel better.

edit: well, it blew up and i have to say 2 things. first of all, english isn't my first language and i'm sorry if i sound silly or you didn't understand some parts. second of all, no, i don't call myself ""organism"". i said that obviously jokingly. i was nervous and wanted to relax a little bit so i added this unfunny note. stop commenting about it.",7
"(nsfw) my friend called the 911 on his gfs mother claiming she was a danger to herself. she has a histoey of mental illness. when the cops showed up, she accused my friend of hitting her. he was arrested, she was left alone in the apartment. the next day she comitted suicide.. as the post says, my friend and his girlfriend lived with her mother and  were taking care of her. i believe the gf was her legal guardian. the mother has a history of mental illness, self harm and sucide attempts. she was just released from the hospital for medical reasons. the other night my friend believed she was a serious danger to herself and call 911 trying to get her to a hospital. ( they did not have a vehicle to take her themselves, nor would she of allowed that ). when the police showed up, the mother claimed her hospital brusise were from my friend and claimed she was abused, she may have been senile enough to of not remembered the hospital. my friend was arrested, and the police said his gf had to leave. he was out on bail, moving his stuff to my house, with his gf working, when the mother committed suicide. the gf went to check on her after work and she found the body. all this could of been avoided if the police took her in and treated her. what are their options? they are young, broke, and in a seriously awful place at the moment. 


edit: wowzer, i can't even begin to thank everyone who has left a message. im still trying to figure out more details of the night, but the gf is blaiming herself and my friend is trying to hold everything together for her sake. thank you to everyone who was nice enough to leave a response, i'll will be sure to talk to my friend tonight as i believe they are staying at my place for the next few weeks. 

edit 2: also, her death was ruled a suicide. both of them were working when it happened. and my friend who was arrested, he is literally one of the nicest people you could meet. i know that's probably thrown around alot and what most people would say in this position, but growing up i was a dumb kid while he was the most sweetest innocent kid i ever knew.

"for 'forcing' my son to be a father after he got a girl pregnant?. my son is 21 years old and got a girl from work pregnant. needless to say, i am incredibly disappointed in him and when he told me i was devastated he'd make such a silly mistake. i asked him about an abortion and he broke down and told me he'd worn a condom and he was hoping she'd abort but to no avail. 

i have met the future mother of my grandchild in a very awkward meeting one day and it's clear to me she's a lovely young lady. however i found out from her (not even my coward son) that he has broken all ties with her and plans only to give child support and not see this baby at all. 

i have been texting her and trying to assuage her worries but she is also understandably worried that she won't have any support and that her baby- my first grandchild- won't have its father. obviously i am very much wanting to be in this child's life also.

of course i have been trying to speak to my son over and over about this issue and i keep telling him that the deed is done and he needs to just deal with it now. he told me in tears that he never wanted to be a father and he wore protection, as well as the fact they were casual lovers and nothing more. i told him i would withdraw all financial assistance if he wasn't in this babies life and he told me if that was the case then so be it, so i took his car and phone and bank cards that were attached to my account. 

in response to this, he's moved in with his father but i have no idea where he lives and he's not even attempted once to contact me. he told me he was leaving and that i wasn't supporting him. my own parents are vehemently against him leaving and have said they'll disown him if he doesn't come back. 

my partner of 12 years however is very much on my sons side and has told me that he's disappointed in how i'm handling this.

"update mother in law suing for visitation in ny.. on mobile. also, this is gonna be a bit long. 

here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aq9o11/mother_in_law_is_suing_for_visitation_ny/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

we went to court for our initial hearing in february. i asked for dismissal citing troxel v. granville. the judge agreed that we were within our rights, however she couldn't grant a dismissal because my mil requested an attorney. the judge advised she didnt qualify for an appointed lawyer so she should seek representation through elder law. my mil begins raising her hands and waving them around asking if she could be allowed to speak. she states in court that me and my wife bully, abuse, belittle, and swear around the children constantly. the first 3 are outright lies and the 4th, so fucking what? she also stated that she never mentioned once being hacked or being obsessed that she was hacked, and that my oldest daughter was the one obsessed with hacking and spying. the judge made no comments and advised her that we weren't keeping her away from the children and that she should seek relief by visiting them under our supervision. 

fast forward to a week before the hearing we have to meet with the kaw guardian for the children. we show the law guardian all the insane conspiracy theory texts and the texts where she accuses me of hacking her phone. she spoke with the children and we took our leave. the paperwork we received stated that my mil showed her a much different conversation. my mil had deleted the texts that made her look bad and copy pasted several from my wife that made my wife look like a bully and that she was harassing my mil. the children outright denied any bullying/abuse and stated to the law guardian that my mil makes them uncomfortable because she is constantly yelling at them, when they want to leave she wont them go and she wont stop talking about who is hacking her. so obviously she supports our position. 

in the hearing my lawyer asked for dismissal, and requested we be paid our legal fees by mil as the petition was brought in bad faith. my mils appointed attorney couldnt withdraw and refile an amended petition because mil wouldnt let her so the judge dismissed and awarded us our legal fees. 

i havent seen the judgement yet but it's my understanding that it was dismissed with prejudice. however my mil doesnt live in reality and is going to file another petition alleging that i've brainwashed my children. i wish that were true, they never listen to me. so i may have another update for you all shortly, but for now i'll enjoy my victory.",2

i called them two weeks ago and asked when i was going to get reimbursed for my flight, they said they were still working on it. 

is there a specific time i should wait for this reimbursement? what are the steps i should take if they just never send anything back to me? 

maybe i'm overreacting, but i gave them the price of my flight well before i even went to the interview, so they've known the cost of it for nearly two months now. just seems a little off to me.

"calling a white person ""colonizer"" is equivalent to calling a black person ""spearchucker"". using the phrase colonizer is quite popular on blacktwitter when referring to whites and it seems to be on par with a white person calling a black person ""spear chucker"". referring to a person based on a historic event/action or cultural stereotype is racist like calling all japanese ""raiders/kamakazi"", somali ""pirates"", etc...

people seem to get away with it because of the belief that you cannot be racist against a white person in a western country, but that is just wrong. i believe that all things should be allowed to be said, but one cannot take the moral high ground and say they aren't racist when they say things like this

​

i would like to thank u/gavroche15 for his concise prediction of what had happened these past two weeks. you can read his thesis here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/96r4mc/fiance_wanted_an_open_marriage_so_i_called_off/e4ppclq).

jokes aside, it has been an interesting two weeks since my initial post.

​

monday last week i talked with a lawyer at work about the situation with the therapist. he looked at me like i was bullshitting him, and asked me if this was a prank. so i asked him if he wants to hear the recording. ""damn right!"" was his answer. i talked again with him the next day, at the end of it.

he noted a few things i didn't pay attention to. on the recording, the therapist was always saying ""we think"", ""we want"", ""we talked about"", ""we decided"". not once did she say ""your ex here asked me to talk with you"" or ""your ex wants you to know"", or anything like that. it was always ""we this"", ""we that"".

he also asked me what my endgame is. do i want to sue? he didn't think i personally have a case, to which i agreed. i never intended to sue anyway, but notify the appropriate institutions and let them deal with the therapist.

a decision was made to write two letters. one addressed to the clinic the therapist works at, and one for apa (we checked, she was accredited). by wednesday there were a few more people at work aware of the situation, including one of the two case researchers. she dug up information about the therapist, online reviews, as well as the contacts for two of her previous patients. the therapist didn't have the best reviews, there were people upset with her, and we managed to track the two we talked with through social media. they were more than happy to help once we explained the situation, and their stories were not any better than mine.

the letters grew a consistent size, as we included the signed stories from the other two individuals, as well as my own description of how my ex changed once she started the therapy sessions, and a detailed description of how my meeting with the therapist went.

friday last week i met with the parents. her parents came to my parent's house, and we had the talk. my ex was there too, and more info was disclosed. that made its way to the report on the therapist as well.

this week, we sent the reports out. there was a reaction from the clinic. they called our office on thursday morning, most probably to check if it is a prank or a real issue. we talked with their lawyer (or one of their lawyers) over the phone, and, when we confirmed it was legitimate, someone else was heard in the background, on their end, with a ""well, crap!"" they said they are taking this very seriously. a conclusion from one of the guys at work was that they probably received other complaints before, but this is the first time someone did it so well documented. their letter also mentioned we are reporting this to apa, that might have turned the heat on as well, hence their quick reaction.

i don't know what the result of this will be, and i consider my issue with it closed. however, having talked with the other two individuals that were ""treated"" by this therapist, i sincerely hope she is at least investigated, because she sounds insane and with an agenda (she ruined their relationships as well). one of the individuals was a woman, for the record.

​

then, my ex and her parents.

​

friday last week my parents called me and asked me to give them a visit after work. when i did, surprise! my ex and her parents were there too. my first reaction, seeing their cars in my parent's driveway, was to flee. this meeting was supposed to be on my terms, but she attempted to take the reigns to it. that was not going to happen, let me tell you.

my ex was waiting for me outside. she looked very good. if there was ever a girl you'd like your parents to meet, she was the image of it.

she told me ""they"" are here to talk with me, and see if we can fix this. ""they"" as in her parents. she either never told them what happened, or she gave them a version of a story they were not buying.

she had a journal with her. she told me she started writing in it before she began therapy, and continued writing in it until that friday morning. that i should read it and it will clear out all this mess. i told her this is not a book club.

i wanted to go inside and get the circus going, but she asked me if i can give her ten minutes. she wants to talk with me for ten minutes before i talk with her parents. and she kept handing me her journal, and started crying. and then my sister showed up, and then my ex's sister showed up. they were already there, and came out to ""check on us"". so i took her journal, went inside, said hello, and lead my ex in the back of the garden, to an as isolated portion of my parent's garden as possible (they have a large garden with a lot of trees and benches).

she quit her job. the stress was too much, and she had a breakdown, it escalated, never got better. she is no longer seeing the therapist. she started seeing the therapist for work related matters, but somehow it turned into matters about our relationship, and it stayed focus on the relationship because it was the only thing the therapist seemed interested in. she never told her parents why she is my ex. she is seeing another therapist now.

i just listened.

she turned the discussion from ""her"" to ""us"". told me i would be in control. i will be managing the finances. i will receive access to all her devices. i will be able to track everywhere she goes. any property we will own will be in my name. she will do anything i want to trust her again. basically things she said in her messages over the last weeks. she enumerated more things than the ones i mention. i don't know how she thinks that would be a healthy life, for either of us.

i asked her is she cheated. she told me she had the opportunity to cheat, but she had never. i believe her. but it also angered me. what does she mean ""she had the opportunity""? if you are in a committed relationship, you don't put yourself in a position where you have this opportunity. you don't want this opportunity. it's like saying ""i had the opportunity to kill someone today"". why? what were you doing that there was such an opportunity. why call it opportunity anyway, it makes it sound like something positive.

that pretty much ended our ten minutes, and told her we should go and talk with our parents.

so we did. i asked our sisters to leave us alone, as it was not any of their concern what was to be discussed. my sister huffed and puffed, but a house made of stone survives hurricanes - and she was not one.

well, i talked, and explained what happened, how the therapy session went, and my resolve. i didn't mention i had a recording, because i never had to. my ex confirmed everything i said, which surprised me. her father had teary eyes, and that broke my heart. her mother asked her if this is how she thinks they raised her, and asked for an explanation.

my ex basically told them the same story. stress at work. depression. breaking down. therapy. therapist wanting to talk only about our relationship. that the therapist told her our relationship was the root of all her stress. that the therapist convinced her i want an open relationship. that she might lose me if she doesn't level her sexual experience with me. how my reaction woke her up from her slump. she quit her job, is looking for something less stressful. she will do anything i want to get me back. started crying.

my ex mentioned the journal again, and said if i read it, it will explain everything, and that she was not on board with the therapist's ideas, but she went along with them because the therapist was a person with authority and experience. our parents looked at me and i told them someone's private journal is not the type of literature i read, unless they are a dead poet.

​

big fucking mistake!

​

my intention was to relate that someone's private journals usually becomes literature if they are a famous writer, or leader, and usually they are published post mortem. also, i was hoping they get the hint that i don't really want to read her journal, because it would be of no consequence. what was done was done. everyone looked at me as if i wished death on my ex. you could smell the hostility in the air.

so i said ""fine, fine"" and ""promissed"" i will read her journal. you win some, you lose some, and then you use the wrong words and you lose a few more.

my ex is seeing a new therapist. she showed her parents emails confirming her appointments. he's an older dude, with a white beard like freud. i searched him online, he is married, he attends conferences, he wrote a few books (they are on amazon, ha!), seems like a solid character.

​

""can you kids work this out?""

​

this was the second thing that angered me that day. as if this is child play, and we should just listen to the adults. we are not old enough to be in control of our own feeling, and we should definitely not be the ones to decide what we consider a betrayal you can't recover from. we are just ""kids"" and we should just work it out. so i won back some ground on the ""dead poets society"" remark earlier.

​

and this is how the day ended.

​

we've known each other for 9 years, and have been a couple for 5 years. even if there are legitimate reasons behind her behavior, how do you go back to being the same? this wasn't even a reset. my way of thinking about my ex has been fundamentally changed. she became a stranger i know a lot of things about. sure, i still find her attractive. very attractive, they way she looked last friday was amazing. no denying that. but it was also calculated, i am not going to lie myself here. hair done the way i like it, dress that i bought for her, the shoes i like the most, a hint of the perfume i gifted her, etc.

​

the journal...

...is on my nightstand. i haven't read it, and i probably never will. i did look through it, to see if it indeed is a year old, and it is. the way the pages folded, the ink is clearly older on the first pages, and you can see it progressing through the pages. the pen she used was attached to the journal, and i tested it, looks like the same ink. and the ink level in the pen is consistent with how much i assume the pen has been used for the last year to write the journal. it is not a fake. everything about it is consistent with a year's worth of wear and tear.

​

i don't see what good reading it will make me. a tool to play with one's mind? well, not rally, i don't think a year ago when she started writing it she intended to use it as manipulation. if what she told me is right, her new therapist suggested the idea to share the journal with myself.

​

as for how i am handling people that are too curious about why the wedding is off? ""we had a huge difference of opinion that we could not find a solution to."" more or less.

but if her sister finds out why, and this is more than likely, because her sister is very close to their mother, everyone will find out the real reason why.

our parents want us to meet again next week. they told me to read the journal, and maybe that helps. maybe we can work on it. start again, fresh, since we have so much history. she will get treatment, she will get better, she still is the same woman i fell in love with, but she is not well right now. they can tell i still love her, or else i would not be so ""theatrical"", their words, not mine.

​

i don't think i will meet them next friday.

​

but, damn! she did look amazing!

​

i would like to thank the community for the support and help. it was enough to help me put together a plan of action regarding the therapist. thank you to those who provided resources and information about what to do.

"girlfriend diagnosed with leukemia w/o insurance last year. now in remission (woo!)... but not without $100,000+ of medical debt.. as the title states;

my girlfriend was diagnosed with leukemia last year and went through chemotherapy at a number of large medical facilities.

a year later, she's in full remission, which is wonderful and the best news possible.

... but...

she now owes money to a variety of medical institutions including three area hospitals, a few doctors offices, medical testing labs, you name it, she has an account there.


she is currently unemployed (because of the intensive treatment), and unable to work for at least the next year. 


what compounds and complicates her situation further is that she is young and unskilled with no current future career path. this meaning that her chances of being able to even make payments at all are pretty slim to none.


what are her options?


would filing for bankruptcy be a fitting option at her age (early 20s)?


if so, what does that process entail? 
she does not own any property or anything of great value. ",10

"by taking ambien and accidentally proposing to my girlfriend. i want to start off with saying that ambien is the strongest drug/hallucinogen i've ever tried and you should not fuck with it.

anyways, one night i just couldnt sleep, so i decided to take 4 10mg ambiens (im an idiot) and i had an engagement ring in my drawer than i traded for some other jewelery because i buy and sell stuff on craigslist. anyways, long story short i woke up and she was wearing the ring on her finger and had explained what had happened and i was just shook because i couldnt remember shit. i go on my facebook and apparently my ambien drugged brain changed my relationship status to engaged and it got 150+likes before i fuckin saw it. i had not planned on being engaged with my girlfriend for another year and a half and probably wouldve gotten her a better ring but ambien sped up the process ten folds.

warning: if its 3am, and you can't sleep ,do not take ambien.

tl;dr - took ambien because i couldnt sleep and ended up proposing to my girlfriend that night.

"by taking amphetamines and subsequently masturbating my limp penis for 6 hours. nsfw. brief summary:

i was recently prescribed an amphetamine medication. i took some and expected the typical described results. what i did not expect was to experience a sharply increased sex drive coupled with an unfortunate effect of impotence - however this would not deter me from my goal of achieving sweet release. i was on a mission to give my brain what it wanted, apparently at any cost, and my rocksteady mental fortitude was nothing short of a fully loaded freight train without brakes.  

ten minutes of sweet loving turned into half an hour in the blink of an eye. confused, yet dedicated, i proceeded onward. the next glance at the clock revealed that three hours had gone by. ""how could this be happening?"", i thought, but i was far too invested at this point to give up. the next three hours went by as quickly and autonomously as the last, but after a total of six hours, the deed was done, and the ensuing moment of clarity was a grim moment indeed as i considered the consequences of my actions.  

my little man has receded mostly into my body and is now simply a swollen nub which stands stoutly as a monument to man's arrogance. also, the entire member feels harshly chafed and my entire pelvic region is sore. i'm not looking forward to the next 24 hours.  

**aftermath: warning nsfw(no blood)**

album of what once resembled a fairly normal penis.(http://imgur.com/a/msz2i)

i'm anticipating a few questions so i will address them here:

* were you ever erect?
     * i achieved at most half-chub intermittently for less than 50% of the entire session.
* did you finish? 
     * yes
* was it worth it?
     * absolutely not
* did you use any lube?
     * no
* does it hurt?
     * terribly
* why did you do it?
     * because apparently i have no self respect.

tl;dr: got high and beat my dick like it owed me money for six consecutive hours - excruciating pain and shame ensued.",4

"by going to the eiffel tower & getting my girlfriend and i tear-gassed, trampled, assaulted, and robbed. ^obligatory: ^this ^didn't ^happen ^today, ^but ^over ^the ^summer. ^also ^warning ^some ^nsfw ^language.

^tl;dr ^first ^because ^it's ^long: ^went ^to ^eiffel ^tower ^to ^watch ^euro ^2016 ^finals, ^ended ^up ^in ^a ^riot(http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/euro-2016-french-riot-police-fire-tear-gas-at-supporters-outside-paris-fan-zone-during-france-match-a7129906.html) ^because ^we ^ran ^late, ^got ^tear ^gassed, ^girlfriend ^dislocated ^knee, ^her ^phone ^stolen, ^my ^nose ^broken, ^and ^our ^passports ^stolen.

**background:** my girlfriend (who we'll call emily) and i were in paris on the very first day of a month long backpacking trip in europe. we spent the whole morning smoking hash at sacre-coeur with some new friends, who told us that the euro 2016 final between france and portugal was that night. they told us to meet them to watch the game at the 'fan zone' at the eiffel tower but urged us *not to be late,* otherwise we wouldn't get into the 'fan zone.' 

being jet-lagged and burnt out from the hash, we took a nap before heading down, but overslept by an hour. we figured we'd head down to the eiffel tower anyway and see what was going on. whoops.

**the fuck up:** arriving at the eiffel tower we realize there isn't any fanzone to be found, or so we think. it turns out we are in the completely wrong place(http://imgur.com/a/8pes8) on the opposite side of the tower from the fan zone, and amongst a crowd of mostly troublemakers that is about to erupt into a riot. 

the first signs of chaos are a small group of youths antagonizing police underneath the tower, and when we see a massive line of riot police facing in our general direction, we decide it's time to leave. 
as we make our way through the crowd i hear screaming and look up in horror to see a smoking projectile sailing through the sky, headed right for us. the crowd around us scatters, knocking emily and i down, where a **tear gas canister blows up mere feet from our faces**. 

""get up! we have to go!"" i'm screaming at emily but i notice she's crying & screaming out in pain, not from the tear gas in our eyes but from the fact that **her knee is so broken the thing might as well be on mars.** i throw her over my shoulder and go sprinting through clouds of tear gas out of the chaos and onto the pont d'iena bridge, where some guy **snatches emily's phone out of her hand**. i turn and watch helplessly as the guy runs off into the crowd, emily screaming ""he took my phone!"" 

""fuck the phone!"" i run as far as my arms/legs allow and then set her down. i need to get her to an ambulance, but i can't leave her to find one, so i need someone to help me. so i start screaming at the crowd around me for someone to help, forgetting that i am amongst almost nothing but riff-raff of the worst variety. nobody helps me or seems to give a shit, so i pick her up and run as far as i can and set her down again. a crowd gathers ogling my girlfriend's knee and staring at me blankly as i shout shit they don't understand like ""911! ambulance!"" 

it's then i am disgusted to notice a hand reaching from emily's purse to my back pocket, and i slap it away forcefully, standing up from a crouching position as i do so, screaming ""fuck out of here!"" i look into the eyes of the perpetrator, a young african guy who loads up and punches me in the face, **shattering my nose**. as blood spurts out of my nose i look at the guy and say with genuine bewilderment ""are you fucking kidding me?"" he looks at me blankly like he is genuinely surprised to see me still on my feet and spitting profanity at him. i scoop up my girlfriend and start running for our lives. 

i'm now running on what i am convinced is just an infinite bridge of hell on earth. brawls rage around us as my knees are starting to buckle, my vision blurring. i'm bleeding out of my head onto my girlfriend's lap who is screaming in agony from being carried around with a dislocated knee. i am pretty sure we are going to die. 

suddenly i'm joined by our savior, a very large goofy looking fellow, who begins helping me carry emily and encouraging us in french or some other language which we didn't speak. it occurs to me that he could be trying to steal from us too, but at this point i don't even care.  our new friend's intentions turn out to be true, as he and his group of friends helped me carry my girlfriend to relative safety and helped me guard her while they got help. (for a while i couldn't tell this part of the story without getting extremely emotional about this guy and his friends who stepped up to help us when everyone else was trying to take advantage of our situation. i'll never forget him.)

a bunch of paramedics pulled up in a station wagon, urging me to stay calm while they waited for an ambulance. as police pushed rioters further down the bridge in our direction, i begged the paramedics to just get us out of there in the car. with fear in their eyes and the situation escalating they finally relented, carefully placing emily in the backseat while i jumped in the trunk.

they got us to a safe part of the city and asked us for our id. it's then we realized that, as if we weren't having a bad day already, **our passports had been stolen.**

we ended up at a hospital outside paris, where they did a great job re-setting my girlfriend's knee and didn't touch my nose which was fine with me. it's still crooked. luckily we were able to get emergency passports and continue on the rest of our trip which was absolutely amazing. i still smell tear gas sometimes when i see  eiffel tower pictures & trinkets. good times!

tl;dr (again): was late to the eiffel tower to watch euro 2016 finals, ended up in a riot, got tear gassed, girlfriend's knee broken, her phone stolen, my nose broken, and our passports stolen.

**edit:** since people are pointing out how i mentioned that the guy who punched me was african, which was for the sole purpose of illustrating the scene, i'd like to add that my entire day in paris was spent hanging out with african guys who showed me more hospitality than i have found almost anywhere else in the world. i hung out with these guys that one day for like 6 hours, they talked to me a lot about just how poor and starving much of the african population in paris is. i harbored a lot of anger towards the guy that punched me for a while but i also understand the context of just how starving that guy probably was. people that are trying to politicize this, or turn it into some racist/anti-refugee talking point, or are leaving comments like ""those thugs should burn in hell"" should have a more nuanced perception of the world.

edit2: if the alt-right folks that are trying to make me their racist champion just because i called the guy african would fuck off, that would be great :)

"i'm getting married and i hate it.. hate might be a big word, but let's say i'm not looking forward to it. previously i had no direction or solid plans in my life, didn't think i needed it at my age anyways (22). i have a job i somewhat enjoy. the woman i'm getting married to is super excited and can't be happier. and she's pregnant. we started off as fwb august last year. she's extremely attractive and the sex is something else, never experienced anything like it. in november she made it clear that she wanted a relationship with me. total breakdown and lots of tears. i didn't. i like her, but we lack common interests besides watching netflix. despite this we stayed fwb, stupid mistake i know. looking back it only gave her hope. we usually used condoms. sometimes when we were drunk or super horny we ditched them, as she said she was on the pill.

skip to march this year and wooooo, she's pregnant! she cried tears of happiness in my arms. i had no reaction. i asked her if she was sure if i was the father, though we were exclusive. she was heartbroken and i felt bad, but in the end she agreed to a prenatal dna test. that shit is super expensive too and the waiting killed me. aaand i'm the father. we cried in each other's arms but honestly that was because i didn't know how to handle my emotions. she suggested we moved in together and become official, abortion was not an option anyways. i agreed and she was (still is) over the moon. we signed a lease in may. she expressed she had always wanted to get married before having a kid and at this point i didn't care anymore and i proposed. wedding is in september. everyone is super excited and happy for us. so many comments about how they we were going to end up together and that we're a great fit. she's planning the wedding together with my mom who is thrilled too. i'm feeling indifferent about it. i think i love her but she's not my soulmate. looks wise she's by far the prettiest girl i've been with. i think it's one of the reasons why nobody thinks it's weird we're getting married so fast.

the catch is that she has never been on the pill in her life. she confessed it after she got pregnant because she couldn't keep it to herself anymore and felt guilty. she's also what i like to call high functioning crazy. not batshit insane but definitely a little bit crazy. nothing i can't put up with however. she tells me she loves me every day and well, is crazy about me basically. would do anything for me, and locked me to her forever with our kid. i grew up without a dad and it was horrible, not like my mom didn't try but it had a big impact on me. i don't want to leave my kid or only see him every other weekend, and i'm sure she would do anything to ruin my life if i left her right now. would still have to pay child support anyways. i've accepted my life as it is right now and i'll try to make the best of it. sexually speaking i'm more than satisfied, still daily and i do love it. emotionally i don't feel as much as a connection. an ex reached out to me and we started talking, but my fiance found out. she forgave me and once again told me she would never leave me and do anything to fix us. i regret talking to her, though we didn't even discuss anything inappropriate or emotionally cheated.

we need to focus on educating our kids about taking emotion out of it, and using rationale instead to come to conclusions.

"by accidentally faking my own death.. i've been getting telemarketer calls incessantly for months and it's driving me insane, most of the time i just hang up once i hear them because i'm also expecting important calls from unknown numbers.

 i was with some friends one night and we decided to order some food from our regular place, the card machine was broken and i had no cash on me so i gave the delivery driver my details and she said she'd come back to my house with the working credit card reader the next night. 

fast forward a few weeks and nearly 50 spam calls from telemarketers, i'd completely forgotten about the previous order. i get a call on my phone and i hear an asian woman ask for me, mispronouncing my last name, not unlike many telemarketers. fed up with it i yell ""no, he's not here because he died!""

not even two hours later there's a knock on my door, it was the sweet delivery lady and she brought a free meal for my household as a sympathy gift to help everyone through the ordeal of my death, while telling us not to worry about the bill from the other week.

"did i 26f overreact breaking up with my boyfriend 27m?. my best friend nicole had a baby a few months ago. he's a sweet kid and i love him very much. things have definitely changed between nicole and me since the baby was born, and i get it. one day nicole had to cancel our plans at the last minute because of the baby and i told my boyfriend that sometimes i wished things could go back to the way they were before. my boyfriend got mad at me for saying that and sarcastically asked if i thought that nicole should have asked me for permission before having a kid and if i thought that nicole should put me first over her baby. 

i said i don't think that at all, i just wanted a safe person to vent to, that's why i talked to my boyfriend about this and not nicole. i wouldn't want nicole to feel bad when she's not doing anything wrong. there's nothing she could or should do differently.

my boyfriend still seemed convinced that i expected nicole to abandon her baby for me, and was asking me if i thought nicole should leave the baby with a stranger or just leave him home alone so nicole could hang out with me. i told him again that i'm not mad at anything nicole did and he eventually seemed to accept it.

nicole told me the next day that my boyfriend went behind my back and told her what i said, claiming he was concerned that i hated the baby. fortunately, nicole is a good friend and asked me for my side of the story and understood where i was coming from. nicole told my boyfriend that she and her husband sometimes feel the same even though they love their son and wanted to have him.

nicole made my boyfriend feel really bad about what he did and he apologized to me, but i told him i wanted to break up. if nicole had been less level headed she might have believed that i hated her baby and broken off our friendship. i hate that my boyfriend assumed the worst and pretty much tattled on me.

he's been sending me messages apologizing for what he did, but i've been ignoring them. i'm wondering if i overreacted and should give him another chance.

edit: some people have asked me if my ex had done this kind of thing before and if this is a last straw situation. it's not, our relationship is actually only a few months old, and only a little older than nicole's baby. i decided to break up because i figured that in brand new relationships it's a major red flag if your first arguments end up causing a lot of problems. especially since what he did could have destroyed my relationship with nicole. i also don't like that he only apologized and admitted he was wrong when nicole told him my feelings were normal, he didn't believe me when i told him i didn't hate the baby. still not sure if i did the right thing, but that's why i decided at the time to just break up.",7

"(washington) i bought my son's friend a hamburger and some hot dogs and his mom is reporting us to cps for child endangerment.. as my kids are about to go back to school, we decided to have a fun weekend. i took both my kids and one friend each to a mariners game this weekend. while there, we had cokes, hot dogs, garlic fries, peanuts, and burgers before the game. all basic baseball game junk food. i am always shocked at how much it costs but we had fun so i didn't mind. last night, my son's friend's mom called us and started screaming on the phone that we allowed her son to eat meat. she said her son is a strict vegetarian and that is how they have brought him up and that we had no right to give him food that she doesn't allow. i know the boy pretty well as he's basically got free rein of the house since they've been friends for years. when he spends time with us, there have always been veggie options for him, but for a while now, he has decided to eat meat with the rest of us. he's 15 years old, and i figured he can choose to eat whatever he wants when he's in our home. i don't care. but according to her, i should have refused to let him eat meat at the game and bought him something else. she didn't seem to be aware that he's been eating meat at our house for about a year. she said she's going to file a complaint with cps for child endangerment and interference with parental rights monday morning. i always thought her elevator didn't make it quite to the top floor, but this seems completely bonkers to me. do i have anything to worry about here?",2

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/acvdlw/update_neighbour_damaged_their_car_pulling_into/

i figured i owed you all one final update. idiot neighbour will now forever be known as asshole neighbour. we received a letter from a law firm representing them. the letter basically says we put obstructions in the driveway when we knew they used it on a daily basis?!?!?!?!?! they are now willing to settle for the cost of repairs plus attorney costs. i don't know if expletives are permitted here or not but fuck them. i may not be able to block them using our driveway (see below) but i won't be paying them anything ever.

we have heard back from the city police and they won't do anything unless we are threatened. a wave doesn't constitute a threat so they want no part of this.

i also got a copy of the property map and the city owns more than half the distance between the house and the road (give or take, the city portion is about normal car length). we are granted a right of way. technically asshole neighbour has no right to use it but nothing will be done by the city to block this (and there is no bylaw against it). lastly, we cannot trespass people on the city's portion of our driveway. i have a feeling that asshole neighbour was made aware of this sometime around when they started using our driveway again.

i have hired a lawyer - he has asked that i no longer post to social media. so, with that said, i'm out.",2
"hi reddit. my dad died last night.. my dad attempted suicide twice when i was in high school. the divorce hit him the hardest, he lost everything he ever loved. i understand why he would want to end it. i used to lay in bed at night and imagine different scenarios of me finding out he killed himself again. i was preparing myself, because i couldn't let myself get caught off guard again. everytime he, my grandma, or my brother called me, my first thought would be ""this is it.  he did it this time"". its been over 10 years and i still had that thought. 

i thought i was prepared. but last night when i got the call that he died, turns out i wasnt prepared at all. he died of believed natural causes, the coroner still isn't sure what his exact cause of death yet.  but he said it doesnt look like suicide. so i guess that's good, right? 

but....hes gone for real this time. it doesnt matter how it happened. i'm not ready. 



edit: wow everyone, thank you for all of your kind words. the coroner determined that his cause of death was a mixture if hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes (he refused to believe he had it) and heavy heavy smoking. it was all too much for his heart. so as one poster said, he literally died of a broken heart. 

while i'm relieved that he didn't take his own life, the fact that his death was preventable makes it even harder to deal with. but so many of you are right, he's no longer suffering, he's no longer unhappy. he's free of all of his physical and mental pain. im still overwhelmed and in shock...i miss his so much. but my friends have been extremely supportive, in a way i could never imagine. and so have you all. thank you all for sharing your stories. i've saved many of your posts to read in the future for the bad days. you all are amazing. 💜 anyone is welcome to pm me if they want to talk further. my inbox is open 💕",11

"update: i (25 f) moved in with my boyfriend (32 m) too soon and he is showing his true colors.. i wanted to give an update since i got a lot of good advice when i posted and a lot has happened in the past couple months. td;lr at the bottom. link to previous post: previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2kj3m/i_25f_moved_in_with_my_boyfriend_32m_too_soon_and/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

shortly after i posted i confronted cam about everything and that i was depressed and upset with his behavior. 

he said he would start to help out more around the house. he also said he would try to stop ranting about work so much and just be better overall.

i gave him like 2 weeks to get it together. surprise surprise he didn't change. 

i went to have lunch with an old friend and they asked me how things were going. i broke down and it was a realization moment for me i was wasting my time staying. cam pushed me to the point where i didn't love him and who he was anymore. i decided enough was enough and i needed to leave. 

while he was at work on a monday i packed up me and the cats and called my mom. she is my hero. she came with her van and helped me load up as much stuff as possible. she is letting me and the cats stay with her and my dad for a little bit until i find the right apartment. 

i waited for cam to come home and let him know i was leaving. he didn't take it well. he said he was caught off guard and wasn't expecting me to leave. he said he gave his life to me and that i ruined everything. immediately after i broke up with him and drove to my parents i felt a sense of relief. 

for the past couple weeks i've been trying to tie up loose ends, like getting the rest of my stuff out and trying to get off the lease. i feel very good about the decision i've made. i'm starting to feel happy again and so are my cats. 

cam has been a complete jerk, which is to be expected. i'm trying not to get wrapped up in what he has been texting me but it still hurts. he basically accused me of cheating on him. i think it's easier for him to accept that as a reason than me not being in love with him anymore. 

right now i'm just trying to find a good apartment to move to. i'm excited to live by myself again and be single for a while. i don't think i will be ready to live with anyone again for a while. i have also started to do things that i love again like bike riding and going on hikes with my friends.

"""s/he started it"" is a totally justifiable excuse. when i was a kid i was horribly bullied, and when i fought back and teachers saw it and i got in trouble, i would say ""he started it!"" only to be told that didn't justify my behavior.

well, it's 30 years later and i still don't see my teacher's point. in fact,i just think the teachers back then didn't want to deal with the horrible behavior of their kids and wanted to sweep it under the rug.

she then created a petition/appeal to the school administration, which i signed. this was also signed by several other students and even teachers and other staff. i was also very vocal about the matter on social media. i got into a few arguments (nothing major) where i posted some statistics i had researched. i even spoke with the newspaper about the issue.

i had to call in sick to work because this is the worst i have felt in a while. it's got to the point now where when i'm going out enjoying myself to try and take my mind off of this horrible burden i have on myself i end up breaking down and bursting into tears because when i try and enjoy myself i can feel the horrible feeling of dread looming over me and growing. 

due to this i had to take a day off, there is no way i could even think about getting out of bed, let alone go to work and pretend to be happy for 10 hours on a night shift. but then i hear that my boss is kicking off and being nasty behind my back over the fact that they are understaffed. it makes you feel so fucking guilty that you're just trying to look after yourself. then it gets heavier and heavier to do anything as you feel as if you're letting people down, you could potentially work yourself into the ground... literally. we have literally forgot how to lool after ourselves because a select few are more focused on themselves. and now i am in this state of i really cannot go into work because of how crippling it is, but i don't want to let anyone down or be singled out as the person thag don't work (this is the only ""day off"" i've had) 

what's the worst is that no one seems to be taking it seriously at all, like i'm doing it for attention because ""what have i got to be depressed about?"" is the recurring mentality for certain individuals. it's not my fucking fault that they should employ more people.

"a warning about the sim swap scam. many of you may know what the sim swap scam is, however, i did not, and unfortunately, i got the opportunity to learn the hard way on christmas eve. if you're not going to read the rest of this, here's the quick take-away: if you unexpectedly receive a text message from your mobile carrier providing you with a pin, do not ignore it. call your provider immediately and take action because someone is likely trying to gain temporary access to your number (or someone else's on your plan) and the damage they can cause is far-reaching.

my wife and i began receiving texts and voicemail from t-mobile on christmas eve morning. the texts would include one-time pins, and the voicemail was from t-mobile representatives apologizing for getting disconnected. each time, we would call t-mobile and speak to a representative and inform them that someone was trying to gain access to our account. and each time, the representative would assure us that there is no way it would happen due to the notes and flags they were putting on our account. i was even laughed at the 4th time i called when i got put on the line with the same representative i spoke to the 2nd time, as she thought it was silly that i was so concerned. when i asked why this person would be working so hard just to swap a sim, i was told it was probably so he/she could make international calls on our account. 
on our 5th call, in the middle of anther one of these assurance speeches, it happened. my wife's phone lost service. i interrupted the t-mobile representative and informed her, who in disbelief began the process of routing the sim back to my wife's phone. roughly 5 minutes later my wife is back online, but there's a big problem: she can no longer sign in to our wells fargo account. that's when it clicked for us: he spent all day trying to get access, got turned down countless times until one bad t-mobile representative granted his request, just so that he could use our number to reset our wells fargo password. the fact that it was christmas eve evening when it all went down likely wasn't a coincidence either as wells fargo and t-mobile storefronts were all closed, and getting help wasn't easy. 
fortunately, we caught it just in time and we were able to get wells fargo on the phone and our accounts locked down. the only actions he was able to take was to move money across multiple accounts into one, with the intention of making an atm withdrawal (according to a wells fargo employee familiar with this scam).
we spent the better part of the day after christmas undoing the damage: closing and opening wells fargo accounts, turning back on online access, switching mobile providers, …etc. i'm left feeling vulnerable. despite all our calls and our warnings to t-mobile, they still let the fraudster in. immediately after we locked down our wells fargo account, as in not even 2 minutes afterwards, i was back on the phone with t-mobile, because they had ""someone on the line who wants to swap sim cards and i just need to get your permission to go ahead"". i felt helpless because obviously t-mobile was doing nothing to prevent this from happening. when i suggested that we shut the whole thing down and cancel our t-mobile account entirely, going without service for the remainder of christmas eve and christmas day, i was informed that while our representative could do that, she couldn't ensure that the fraudster wouldn't be able to call in and turn everything back on. 
we ended up making it out okay, and it appears that after the fraudster realized he wasn't going to get anything out of our wells fargo accounts, he moved on. i'm not sure at all that switching to a new carrier will prevent this from happening, but due to t-mobile's response, or the absolute lack-there-of, i felt i had no choice. i want to make others aware of this as we might have had more options had we known what was going to happen when we first started receiving unexpected texts and voicemail from t-mobile. please do take it very serious and act quickly if you suspect this is happening to you.

it seemed like there was no harm sharing the evidence, as long as it was unmodified (it was not modified).

the manger of the dealership has finished reviewing the footage and called me yesterday to set up a meeting to discuss the abuse to my car. 

to summarize everything that occurred;

1) cpo vehicle was damaged upon pickup, i foolishly agreed to let the dealer fix it rather than taking my credit union's check and leaving

2) repair work was less than average in quality, clear coat runs, body panel still was damaged (it was a fender and it was still bent on the inside). found the passenger fog light is also damaged after the repair, dealer claims i bought the car like that, its a cpo and it should have been inspected (as per manufactorer's inspection sheet). 

3) dealer agrees to fix it again, i drop the car off during my 2 week long vacation. car sits at the lot, gets joy ridden back and fourth between the body shop (~75 miles round trip), body shop wet sands clear coat, doesn't address additional damage, says ""we stand by our work.""

4) found footage, emailed dealership with clip of footage explaining i am upset and want compensation for the wear to my vehicle, unhappy with the body repairs that are still not done properly.

5) ~1month to get a response, had to reach out to corporate customer relations to get the dealer to respond after multiple phone calls/voice mails and no returned calls.

6) dealership manager reaches out, wants video footage of incidents, i dropped footage off 

7) setup meeting with manager this coming week to follow up and discuss.

the car was ran to redline multiple times, the driver seemed to not be very good at driving stick, so he/she frequently was riding the clutch during these jaunts to high rpm, he clutch dumped it once causing wheel hop/spinning tires. my trips to the dealer have added about 500 miles overall to the car just trying to get the body work addressed and now the excess wear to the vehicle from being driven hard, this has been going on since the end of march. 

i am not sure what kind of compensation i should see to be acceptable (legally speaking). initially i asked to have the dealer buy the car back from me so i could walk away from all of this, but i don't anticipate this to be given as an option. realistically what should i expect given the circumstances, and what should i find to be acceptable?",2
"friends reported me as a suicide risk as a prank, i was taken to a psych ward for the whole weekend. need advice on legal consequences of their actions.. a few of my friends (not anymore) thought it would be funny to report me to the police as a suicide risk. i was out with them on friday night and we had a few drinks. after i left for home, apparently they decided to call the police in turns (maybe 6 or 7 calls) each telling them that i was very suicidal that night and i had repeatedly told them that i was considering suicide and that i also own a gun. they lied about me being cheated on by a girlfriend earlier this week. i don't have a girlfriend.

anyway, that night police showed up and i was drunk. obviously at the time i didn't know what was going on. the police asked me several questions and i answered them, but i was also very sleepy. police told me that i need to be checked by a medical professional and they're waiting for the ambulance to arrive. i was checked by the ems and asked to go to a hospital with them for further tests to ensure that i was fine. at the hospital they wanted to perform blood and urine tests which i refused to consent to. i was told that i'm not allowed to leave until i am assessed by a social worker in the morning. this left me so frustrated and in the morning i was a little agitated by all of these when i did speak with the social worker, who then recommended that i'll be taken psych ward for further examination and ensuring that i was not a danger to myself and others. up until this point i had no idea that my friends had reported me for this. the social worker said this decision is made based on the testimony of multiple people who know me personally who were concerned for my well-being and they can't take these signs lightly.

to make it short, things were cleared up at the psych ward (although very slowly) and i was let go on monday morning in time to make it to work without being significantly late.

my friends (not anymore) had bragged on facebook about how they've made me committed and were praising their skills of deception and pranking. luckily, another friend noticed these and took screenshots.

assuming i go to the police with these, are they facing any legal consequences?

"for not fessing up to causing a coworkers allergic reaction?. last week one of my coworkers started to feel unwell and another coworker took her to the er. she was having an allergic reaction. she has an allergy towards peanuts and thinking back on it i probably caused the reaction since we both had had to use the same computer to check order and i had peanut butter on my waffles that morning. i definitely don't think i washed my hands after either. once somebody got the call she was ok they asked us all in a group who had had peanut butter that day and i stayed completely silent.

well, yesterday she came back into work. she was fine and everything, but apparently the trip to the er still cost her $300 after insurance plus the money she lost not going to work for a two days. our coworkers all sympathized and a few started saying whoever had the peanut butter should have to pay. since i wasn't part of that conversation. i just heard them from across the room, i just focused on my work an tried to avoid the subject for the rest of the day.

edit. a ton of people have brought this up so just so you guys know i will bring up worker's compensation and she did have an epipen.",3

"houseguest had a deadbolt installed after being reminded that he'll have to leave soon. questions about the situation in general but specifically the locksmith's liability here. (update). tl;dr - things kind of managed to sort themselves out

so i got a call while i was getting ready to head back to the apartment to meet the locksmith. it was pete's brother. apologies for the lack of details here but i don't know too much about exactly what went down, and a chunk of what i do know is sort of personal shit that the brother, who just did me an enormous favor, probably wouldn't want me sharing. anyway, the gist of the phone call was that he went by and performed a third party constructive eviction with the back of his hand. so pete's gone, as is most of his stuff. his brother is going to swing by next week to grab any odds and ends that they may have missed. i am planning on making him dinner and hitting him off with a bottle of good whiskey when he does so.

as far as pete goes, i'm thinking that i'll follow through with at least the early part of the eviction process just in case he tries anything cute. gonna speak to my attorney about this first, but he's still in the wind. turns out he's staying at a cabin his girlfriend's family owns and it's pretty much as close to being in the middle of nowhere as human-built structures get. his admin/paralegal... i dunno what she is specifically, but she said that yesterday was the one day he wasn't going into town for cell service. this gives us the opportunity to convince him that the situation is currently way worse than it ever was, and as much as i love this guy, he's really fun to fuck with so that's cool. 

after speaking with him i called the owner of the locksmith to let him know that the apartment was vacant, so his guy wouldn't need to show up with police. turns out he was planning on coming by to handle this himself anyway, so that was easy enough. i met him over there, he had a handful of deadbolts for me to choose from, and he switched out the lock in about five minutes. we got to bullshitting about baseball because that's what you do in new york, and this led to him accepting my offer to buy him a beer so we could watch the white sox smack our yankees around. i got some backstory at the bar, and while this is secondhand information, the dude seems pretty reliable so i've got no reason not to believe him. 

the guy who came over yesterday morning was indeed an employee of his, but he wasn't on the clock and actually ""borrowed"" the deadbolt without mentioning anything. turns out he is an old friend of pete's, and had been fed a story about an insane landlord who had decided to move into the apartment pete was renting. brilliant. anyway, my new locksmith buddy told me that this guy was officially unemployed as of that afternoon. i'd feel bad for the dude but i'm too busy not caring about what his motivation was due to the complete and total lack of any attempt to verify the story he'd been fed. this also explains the the non-answers i got when i called the shop - the person i spoke to was a manager who had absolutely no idea what i was talking about. he was basically trying to buy some time to speak with the owner and the guy who installed the deadbolt instead of just pulling an excuse out of his ass for me. i wish he'd told me that in the first place but i do appreciate the fact that he didn't just try to go into cya mode for the company/his (now former) co-worker. all in all, i have a new preferred locksmith for when i need something done at any of my properties. 

so really the only legal shit left is the restraining order, and pete very kindly sent my wife a few emails last night upon figuring out that she'd blocked his number. not gonna go into detail but i'll just say that the contents should make the restraining order easy to get. 

so thank for all of the help and well wishes, but it seems like this is more or less a wrap, and a pretty amusing one too. my wife's gone from upset about the whole thing to uncharacteristically indignant, which she's admitted is kind of cathartic for her, so i don't even have a reason to feel guilty about laughing about what a moron pete is!

again, thanks all.",2
