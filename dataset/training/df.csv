"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: wow, this got very big. it's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

and alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so i might have a warped view on this one. 

edit 3: i've never seen this movie, but it's come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent tl,dr: ""you're not wrong walter, you're just an asshole""",3
"update, for despising my mentally handicap sister?. i'm back like i said i would be,. my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

well, since that day i made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. the week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

i started by telling my grandpa the story of why i broke down the way i did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. no one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. my grandpa told me some things that i don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this i was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. with everything else i told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. he pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when i sat down with them. it didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. this included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

suffice to say, this week has been rough. but, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. my grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things i want to do. my aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

well, saturday night i sat down with parents to talk. it went badly to say the least. they came clean to me about everything. they told me things i will not repeat here. but they did not apologize. my parents still claim that i some how owed my sister my time. my father even saying ""you were put here to be her caretaker"". i won't lie and say i was composed. after everything i learned i confronted them. on the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. the money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. they denied it or made excuses. and in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

today will be my last time talking to them for a while. after talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, i'm not going back. later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. when i graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. my aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. my parents have called me twice since saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when i was coming home.

i won't be going back to them. right now i still feel pretty uneasy about everything but i feel like that will pass. the rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. but in the end i lost my parents. over all of this, i've learned something that i wished i saw earlier. i don't hat my sister. in fact i love her with all my heart. i should never have never projected my hate onto her. that was wrong, and someday i hope to make up for it. but for now i need to leave.

so, there's my update. thanks again for the support my original post got. i really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. thanks you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much! i wish i could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. i'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. i want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200b;

late edit: wow, i never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. i know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200b;

we just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. every thing i wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. i have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record i could think of. my parents were quiet the whole time i was there. shorty after i arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. it took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. i hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. even now i sit here and think if she really meant it. after this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. i hope she meant it. right now though, i think i just need to look ahead. maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. i hope so.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice and love. it's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience i at least got some positive out of this mess. will i come back? i don't know. if something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. but for now i'm going to move on. for all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and i hope to see you on the other side. see you space cowboy's :)",3
"update: for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. everyone's comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

since i received such great advice on my original post, i felt like i had an obligation to update. and i'm trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

the funeral service was held this past thursday. before then, i brought all the advice i received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how i was feeling and what i should do. 

my sponsor was straight with me and told me that i would be putting myself in danger by going and that i should do something else that day to grieve. 

when thursday rolled around, i was a mess. i seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead i grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

we went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

i'm doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

i haven't reached out to any of marcy's family and i don't plan to. i understand now how devastating that would be. 

that's it. take care everyone.",3
"meta: too many commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.. i've become frustrated with how quick a lot of commenters are to encourage op's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. while leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

when we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for love, empathy, understanding, and communication. these capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. i often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",3
"for making a dad joke?. note. my step-daughter, madeline, was about a year old when i married her mother, jessica. madeline's father died before she was born. 
 
madeline is currently 15, and she's rebelling for almost everything. she did something bad, so while picking her up, i set a punishment up for her. then she said ""you're not my dad. i don't have to follow you"". honestly, i got a bit hurt from that. but i understand that she didn't mean it, and that she'd probably change. i just replied ""i'm still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules."" 
 
that happened about 2 days ago. so our family was going grocery shopping, when madeline said ""i'm hungry. i need food."" i decide to be extremely cheeky and say ""hi hungry, i'm not your dad."" my son just started to laugh uncontrollably. my daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. and my wife was berating me ""not to stoop down to her level."" 
 
i honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. and my son agrees. so aita?
 
edit: i did adopt her. so legally i am her parent.

 
mini update: i'll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. i go to my daughter's room after dinner and begin talking with her. ""hey. i'm really sorry that i hurt you by the words i said. and i am really your dad. i changed your diapers, i met your boyfriend, and i plan on helping you through college. and plus i'm legally your dad, so we're stuck together. but seriously, i'm going to love you like my daughter even if you don't think i'm your dad. then i hugged her. she did start to cry. i assume that's good.",3
"for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?. we had a family dinner this evening. my family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29f), younger sister (24f) and youngest brother (22m).

extended family attended our family dinner. so all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. during the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. my sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. the two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""shut up, i'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" my brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. i think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

anyway, i immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. she replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. this annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

so i responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, i genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

family is blaming me for their marital problems. i refuse to accept i did anything wrong. my sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all i did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",3
"for suggesting my 7yo name his new stuffed tiger ""tig bitties""?. pretty much the title. my son won a stuffed tiger at the fair last night and said he had named him ""tig"". he asked me what its last name should be. i couldn't help myself and just instantly replied ""bitties"". then i turned to my wife to share a smirk, but she was pissed and quickly suggested a few different last names, but my son insisted that he liked ""bitties"", so now his tiger is tig bitties. my wife thinks it was completely inappropriate, i think it was a silly joke that went over his head and will have no negative ramifications.",3
"aita for wearing the ""joke"" bikini my friend got me?. so it was my birthday couple months ago. had a party. got some gifts. my friend ""mandy"" for me a ""super cute bikini"". i liked it. said thanks. she had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

anyway. went to the community pool with my roommate. wore bikini. got in the water. roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... i look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

haha good joke mandy. 

anyway, mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. most leave and we're still hanging out. i'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? i go change after them. and meet her bf in the hot tub she's getting new drinks. i hop in. immediately, he's looking at my chest. i pretend i don't notice and just make small talk. she comes out a few min after. and just looks in shock. eventually gets in. ""uhh is that the one i bought?"" yeah i love it. i wear it everywhere. make up some stuff about how i wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she's just like ""oh"". 

we're in the tub for 20-30. eventually get out and change. she approached me after and was like. ""uhm i'm sorry thought you'd notice. but it goes kinda see thru"". i'm like yeah i know why'd you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? ""she's like it's a joke. wait you knew? so you just spent last 30' flashing my bf on purpose?"" i reply i'm just wearing my birthday gift from her. 


anyway. aita?",3
"for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?. dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but i'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

we've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. this year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and i jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. we learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, i adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

none of this has been a problem for me until recently. she saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then i rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. she exploded in anger (teen years, i'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, i know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was her pan for vegan food. i was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not your pan. 

she asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. i didn't want her to feel weird about food, so i said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. the reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that i'm not to touch them unless i'm cooking vegan. 

that wasn't good enough. now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because i eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. i don't mean i literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because i wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly i'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. my wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. my daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. now i'm sorry for her, but i feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because i'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",3
"for despising my mentally handicap sister?. the title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200b;

my sister is severely autistic. she requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. she is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200b;

i hate her. that should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200b;

i was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. even since i can remember the world has revolved around her. i was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. all of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when i complained. even when i was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me i was in the wrong.

&#x200b;

along with this i am expected to take care of her and drop everything i do for her. i can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. even when i do somehow get time to myself i am required to leave if they need me. if i do not then i am punished. the recent example of this is when i went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200b;

it seems as if i am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. this last week i was chosen to give a speech at a school event. i was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200b;

i've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. while talking about colleges with my father, he joked that i should get a degree that pays well so when their gone i can take care of my sister. i don't know why but this caused me to break down. i cried and screamed about how it always about her. i'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that i'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200b;

i've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. am i the asshole here?

&#x200b;

edit/update kinda:

wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. i never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. thank you all. after thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that i don't despise my sister. it's not her fault that she was born the way she is. my parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but i was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. they have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. my parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best i leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?. so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?. new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3
"for giving my ex wife a large amount of money i won despite the anger of my gf?. i recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. i won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. it makes me feel funny even typing it's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

my ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. she is an amazing woman and good to the bone. we divorced 6 years ago because i had an affair with my current partner. i was in a low place in my life and i fucked up. she was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that i know she was hurting. she still is close with my parents. she is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

she was actually the first person i phoned after my mom and pops after i found out i won the lottery. she was pleased for me, joked that i could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. nothing else. as soon as i won, i knew i wanted to give her a significant amount. i still love her. she's the mother of my babies and i feel like this is some small tiny way i can show her that i'm not a complete fuck up. she deserves to know that i care despite my mistakes. she also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. give our kids a better life between us. i haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but i have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

long story short, when i told my gf, she was my livid. screaming that i'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- i'm not *in* love with her. we've both grown apart, but of course i still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. my gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh i'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. i don't plan on changing my plans, but aita?

"for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?. ok this is the worst. i'm losing sleep over this.

i'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and i cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

my brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. i come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

so my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, i'm so happy my brother found a great guy. but it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

i've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause i know it stresses him a lot, and i think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus i bet a few family members already know anyway.

but he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. i see the opposite, i see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. i have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. i was not expecting that to be honest. so he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

if it was any other occasion i would be supportive obviously, but i don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. and i don't want to get the attention away from my fiancee, that's her day. and i dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and i think it's a pretty good reason

i asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. this is killing me. i would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if i had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and i can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

i didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

with a heavy heart, i asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that i hope he understands me. he  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

next day i got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". i tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

he eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

this is the worst situation of my life, am i the asshole for handling it the way i did?

ps 1: i wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

ps 2: thanks for the gold and stuff!

update: spoke to fiancee, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

clarification: i know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. the trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.i don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. literally every other day of my life i will support my brother's decision to come out. even at the wedding, i would obviously defend him. but the point is, not at the wedding. also, my brother is not the asshole. not at all.",3

> unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. however, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to google).**

> we don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. however, we know it was much shorter. i think it was somewhere around half?

> this shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback).

# original thread info

hey all you assholes and judges. we recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. a huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. take a look here(https://m.imgur.com/a/vzvv1ag). 

we think that's a problem. a comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. we want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. so, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# introducing ~~30-minute~~ 60-minute contest mode

for the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **contest mode.** the comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. you will not be able to see the karma score of comments. after 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. the comment order will be ""best"" instead. 

**why did we do this?** the first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. by opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. no one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. we tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). it didn't work out well. a 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",3
"for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?. **updated 7:50 pm:** holy crap! thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. i never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! i had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when i checked back in after work. several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200b;

my intent was to answer more questions since i wasn't able to do that while at work. i was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however i've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what i have already posted if i wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200b;

just a couple things i want to address in my update here. some people are saying i'm leaving out details. my original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. i had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so i apologize if it looks like details have been left out. i did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. lastly, my son is now back with me. there was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200b;

i'm sorry if i didn't respond to your comment or private message. i'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. i can't even begin to put into words how grateful i am. again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

back in november 2018 i was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. it was the most humiliating thing i've ever experienced. i later learned at the police station that i was being charged with multiple felonies. this came as a huge surprise. luckily i was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. for $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, i was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. however it cost me everything and i was unable to pay my bond. this resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. at a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and i ended up having all my charges dismissed. when i finally got out i learned that i had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. his mother is a heroine addict and i haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. they wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200b;

since my release, i've learned that i can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that i was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. i've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. they took down my info but never followed up. so what i did was create a website sharing my story. i also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. literally the only reason why i was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. if the detective had done his job, he could have verified that i wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. this is what pisses me off the most. my life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200b;

i'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. i live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. my web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. i received a cease and desist letter recently, which i showed to my attorney. he said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything i had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. yesterday i received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. he apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" they then talked to me about my website and asked if i could remove it. i said i would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200b;

after the visit i received, i'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. i don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. my friends think i'm being spiteful and have suggested that i just delete it. for keeping my website up?

"for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?. **edit: the boyfriend doesnt live with us and doesnt pay rent or bills. him and his daughtes spend time here and pay only for their food: something i do as well*** 

my dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. i'm 23m and going into my final year of college. my moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. my mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. and while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

he isn't a bad guy, i'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. he tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. i think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

he's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. they aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

i live in the basement of my moms house. i have since i was 15. when you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. so it's pretty separate. 

so last night i was dding for some friends and got home at 2 am. i had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. so this has never been a big deal with my parents. i shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. i got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

i snapped and laid it out for him. i told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. i told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him. 

he told my family and they think i'm the asshole. aita?",3
"update: for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?. this is the original post: /r/amitheasshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

i first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. it honestly helped me so much and without it i don't know if i'd end up in this position.

so i went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. they of course said no. i'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. however he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

so i went to my teacher. i already knew how everything was going to go out so i didn't have any hope. i told her that i don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues i would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the mrs.). she told me that i was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. i told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. i handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my english teacher). her face went from nothing to just sadness. i swear it was so weird. it's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

she apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. and saying my name just gets her bad memories i guess? she told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. at this point i kinda felt guilty because i never took this thought into consideration.

she told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime i can still call her by her first name. ( all my classmates are jealous because i'm the only person allowed lol)

we've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

honestly this isn't how i thought things were going to turn out. and i'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",3
"for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?. i (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. my boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. he gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. i'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

however, there's one girl in our class, let's call her victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. she goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

i've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. she was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him i was there too.

victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. i snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. you're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

she looked super embarrassed and walked away, and i later heard she'd gone home crying. i feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. aita?

edit: she 100% knows that i am his girlfriend, i have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",3
"for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?. 
throwaway because husband told me i was ta and want to know before i get home and argue. on phone format is bad.

i was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. one of the girls had picked out a pair of very expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine i have my dads credit card i'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because thats not her card. i've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so i'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

we end up at the same register (me behind) and i see her total hit well over four digits. the girl is about to swipe her card when i decide that i can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. i tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and i'm not sure she has permission. girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look i've ever seen. i swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, i don't think she was ever told no.

girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. now that i've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. girl tries to show id to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and i tell her it's still fraud. girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. i tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or i call the cops. girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. she uses her own card and leaves crying. cashier looks mad at me and i tell my husband when i get home only for him to agree i was in the wrong.

"for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?. i am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. both of them had spouses at the time. my birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when i was conceived so there was no way i was his. a few months after i was born they decided not to divorce. i was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that i am adopted by my grandparents. recently i decided that i wanted to know more about my dad's family and i sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so i could get to know him. well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over skype. they both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

well i did pretty much the opposite. i contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. she is now divorcing him while on my mother's side i told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother.

we called him into a meeting on friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. i thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

"hey assholes, you're doing it wrong.. since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time i ranted about voting on this sub. so, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: welcome to the sub! second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

you may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **upvote real dilemmas**. if you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the op is an asshole or not, **upvote it**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. if you see a post where you think the op is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **upvote it** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **stop rewarding validation posts**. upvotes are not a political statement. they aren't something you give because the op is really nice. every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the op is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the op, they're ruining the sub. if you want to tell op they're great, write an nta comment and praise them all you want. don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

as you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. what makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. this is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. please be the better person and vote correctly here. interesting content depends on it!  (if you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

also important: in the comments, show a little backbone. **don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** if you say the post is nta, and someone else says it's esh, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. if you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. there are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. the whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. if you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and gtfo. you have come to the wrong place.

p.s. if you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. maybe you're not an asshole after all.  


edit:  i see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  i suggest you read the full rule book and the faq if you think you've got a new idea.

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?. background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

as i'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. like wtf?",3
"for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?. i fucking hate wedding culture.

it's bullshit.

my fiance and i thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. we were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

then the demands started coming out. they wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person has to be a groomsman, etc etc. suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

we put our foot down and said:

>thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. when we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. with so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>if you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. but if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

this has caused an epic shitstorm. such to the point where i have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. my parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

we are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?. my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"for purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?. this issue is honestly making me frustrated. almost everyone is saying i am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and i genuinely don't know if what i did was correct or not. i just feel so lost. please, please do help.

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

this post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person i believe wronged me.",3
"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her.. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. 

i just want to know what reddit thinks because half my friends think i should go and the other half think i'm justified in saying no.",3

"for calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after i asked her multiple times not to.. i have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. i'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. she is very overweight. all the time she makes comments about my weight. she doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and i even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". i have only worked there 8 days. i have asked her very nicely to stop. yesterday i asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

today when she said ""morning slim"" i replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying i'm wrong and i should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". i said as long as she calls me slim, i will call her chunky and now i'm the bad person. if i don't apologize? the owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".

edit for more info: we don't have hr. there's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). we are all regular employees. i went to the owner before i called her chunky and i asked him to talk to her because i felt she was harassing me. that's when he said we can handle it ourselves. that's why i called her chunky. i told her to stop calling me slim and i didn't like it and she continued to do it. she didn't stop doing it after i asked multiple times and i didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. she brought up my weight, i brought up her's.",3

"for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?. i have 3 kids, 15f, 12f and 7m. my oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because i am too. recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. it was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

after the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. there was a fair bit of wine involved (i was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my fil let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate i still cuddled with my 15yo. i don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but i was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. to my surprise, my wife and mil both agreed with him.

i have a lot of respect for my in-laws, i get along with them great and i consider them closer than my own parents. obviously i'm quite fond of my wife as well, but i outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. i've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. they all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. aita?

"for not telling my wife that i picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?. i'm going to try to keep this short and simple. i always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and i'll drop whatever i'm doing and i will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. i let them know that i used to be a teenager once before, i told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. we're only human and it's a part of life.

last weekend i got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. she was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

i got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. i had to pick her up and carry her to the car. i told her i was disappointed that she snuck out, but i also told her i was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?. my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

"for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?. hi all. 

i gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter charlotte. 

my cousin alice and her parents were among the guests. the first thing i'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. she's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. she doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. she is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

it was alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly charlotte vomited on her. alice handed charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. i went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. my mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

today i got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

i have said no. at the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. she took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. i feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

edit: thanks for all the dms but please stop sending me articles about the woman named marijuana pepsi and the black spider-man named miles. thanks y'all.",3
"for pretending to be an ""appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?. i got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

i told them them all that i had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. when i first told them they thought i was joking, but they underestimated how committed i would be to a joke. so, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) i was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

finally after about a week they bought that i had become an appletarian. they started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. some of them even got angry.

but i wanted to stick with the joke. finally, after the end of 3 weeks, i walked into what i was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

they were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. finally i started laughing hysterically. they were confused as hell so i told them i had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. i even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

i thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. my girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago i had ruined our date night when i told the waiter i only wanted apples because i was an appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

in my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

but, did i go too far?

"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?. i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

"update:for objecting to 'girls day'?. hello,

this is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

this last month has been kind of wild for me so i haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. so the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. due to the fact that i had deactivated my facebook and was only receiving text messages, i didn't realize what was happening before i was ambushed by it. my sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and i confirmed that it was. and she insisted i was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. i responded that i in no way did that as i was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

this spread to my family and now the thread was shared on facebook and everyone was shown. i was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where i was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what i did was wrong and demanded an apology. they said that 'i knew' they weren't excluding me and because i gave everyone that impression i owed them an apology. i replied that i absolutely did not know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. i replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-op event, not a girls only event.  they explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether i was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because i'm not a girl. at this point we were going around in circles so i just explained my perspective, i said that i'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it i feel excluded. i explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation i was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

at the end of this family meeting, i was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and i was accused of many things that i didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. i told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that i was going no contact for a while. i told them i'm an adult, and i have my own life, and the reason i wanted to be involved was because i didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. if that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but i told them that i was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. my mother/sisters told me that if i was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. at this point, my relationship with my family is over, i left that family meeting and have not reactivated facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. que sera, sera.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3
"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents?. let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

no advice needed, but i have to know. have i been an ass?",3
"for going to the police over a 'prank'. throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

to preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. 


four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. 

i found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the chickens!!!""). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

they all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.",3
"for i telling my childhood bully (who is mtf transgender) that she will always be the ""boy who bullied me""?. when i was a in middle school, i was viciously bullied by this boy, who i'll call z. he spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner. ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me."" 


then i left the restaurant without her. i don't know what occurred to me but i probably shouldn't have done that, but i guess it kinda just snapped. aita?",3
"because i ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?. what i thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and i'm up at 7:05 am dealing with it. i figured while i wait for a text, i could post here to see if what i did was really that bad. 

i'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. i love to eat which probably borders on addiction but i figure since i'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. i have some great friends although there is no doubt i'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. i guess that sets the stage enough. 

last night my friend hosted ufc and i was invited. he got a 6 foot party sub. i also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. well of course people flocked to the food and i had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and i didn't get to have a single one. which is totally fine that's why i brought them but maybe an hour later i was starving. i kept eyeing the sandwich and i'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. i waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). so i was like screw it...i took about half of what was left and ate it. then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

well to be sure as i was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. like i was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. i guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. she was furious and said that i was an incredible pig and that i had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. i felt so bad i tried to explain to her that i really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. i also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

i offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. i said i was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

i woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that i had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that i embarrassed myself last night. i tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

was i the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

edit: i guess i've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so i can't find out why.

to answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. this is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",3
"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?. the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"if i called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?. my son was born when i was only 15 years old, and i've been a single dad since i was 18. it was hard living for a long time money-wise but i always tried to do best by my son. today i own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. he came out to me when he was 14 years old and i've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3
"for choosing my brother over my marriage?. my parents divorced when i was 3, and went into separate marriages. i had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. when i was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. i had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. my mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. my father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. obviously my family is morning, and i've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

the only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and i'm not going to let that happen. i told my wife that i was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. she did not take it well and is furious that i would choose my brother over her. i doubt my marriage will survive, but i can't let my brother go into foster care.

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago?. for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3
"for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?. train is packed, it's hot, i'm tired and looking for a place to sit. everything was occupied, but at one point i see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. i went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. i asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. i noticed she had headphones in, so i figured i'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as i'm sitting down.

as soon as i touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck i was doing. i explained. she then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. i told her i knew for a fact she was alone because i just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. so i started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

this released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. i saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so i figured i'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""oh i'm sorry, i didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. my bad, i'll get up now"". i got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as i was walking away.

i noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so i kinda wondered if i stepped too much out of line there.",3
"for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.. i have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that i hang out with almost every day. we've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, john. 

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

"for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?. i work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

i told them ""you might want to cut that out! llamas spit in self-defense."" but they kind of laughed my warning off.

now, i knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. but i decided not to tell them about that. i figured if they persisted, i'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

the llama was being patient. at one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. it got the girl square in the face. she dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that i was in.

to make things worse for them, i didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! it was a slow day, so i just locked the doors. i told them i didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

aita? the girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. maybe it was...i knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but i wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",3

after a while i made a phone call using my earbuds. literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

i was as polite as i could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and i could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

she said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones.

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?. when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

a lot of you post about stuff because your friends and family aren't on reddit, but now we need to be careful as to what other social media they may be on, and take extra steps to preserve your anonymity. throwaways are already encouraged, but make sure names are changed enough (not just initials), and change any non-relevant details. good luck!

"for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i'm 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

i was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

i managed to get with a beautiful girl named marcy when i first started getting into the thick of things. she knew who i was but she said she loved me. 

i will regret this for the rest of my life, but i was the person who shot up marcy for the first time. after that, there was no stopping her. she stuck around with me, probably because i was her dealer more than anything, but then i got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

a year ago she reached out to me on facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped i was still clean. 

last week i got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on facebook that marcy had od'd and there was a funeral service this upcoming thursday.

i immediately just burst into tears because i hoped that this would never happen and i feel so much guilt over it. 

i want to go to the funeral service for her but i'm afraid that my presence would be unwanted. at the most i would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. i need to do this for myself. 

for wanting to go?",3
"for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?. about two months ago, my husband and i got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. it was so much fun. we went on a honeymoon after. the price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. as a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or i could afford! my husband and i paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

the wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. about a year and a half ago, i was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). i had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. my husband and i decided to get married so i could join his health insurance. it was a quick justice of the peace ceremony. we were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. a few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something i didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. we weren't trying to be deceptive. however, part of it was that i wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. my husband respected this. my parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. his mom (i'll call her carol) and i aren't close. she's fine enough in low doses, but...

we're currently in the process of moving. this past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. as we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. and then she noticed the date. 

carol lost it. she insisted we lied to everyone. she said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. she said we were sneaky and deceptive. she is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

for me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so i could get insurance. a means to an end. our wedding date is what we will celebrate. are we assholes for not being more upfront? i've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. my husband insists we are not assholes.",3
"for refusing to use the money i inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? she is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.. when i was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. in one split second, the happy family i knew was gone, and i went through the darkest time in my life.

my parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). she never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship i wanted to have with him. i eventually forgave my dad mostly because i was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. i talk to him but i want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

my mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which i now own and operate. i am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. he was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

this year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. the bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

the thing is, i don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when i think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and i have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. i'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. they are her parents after all. the only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""she is your sister"" and ""if she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

"for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /petty. ok so this is kinda complex, i'll make it short.  this acc is just for privacy reasons

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

aita? i don't hate my bro and i (kinda)  get what he is saying, but i just have a resentment for my parents. it's not like i had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks i'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. i'm curious on what reddit thinks. i want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",3
"for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?. i have waited tables for the last three years.

during my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. they were a pleasure to have as customers. they ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

when i was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, i walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. when i rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. i figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. they ordered their entrees and i went off to handle other tables.

about five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. at this point i started getting concerned, but i took the order and cheerfully said i'd be right back. this time, i went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. he was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, i told him to just trust me. 

a few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and mrs. pregnant woman was also getting into it. i figured that since she didn't notice, things were ok. the problem came when i took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. when mrs. pregnant woman got to the counter, i saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). my bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

it was too late for me to edit them back, so i just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. they all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. they were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an uber.

several minutes later mrs. pregnant woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. i fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. she blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. i said no, but told her that i assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. it was a lame lie and i'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. i did so. then she talked to my manager. my manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

i stood my ground and told her that i'm not going to be responsible for fas. she told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. she also informed me that i could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

but when i talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. the entire staff at the restaurant is against me and i think that i'm going to call in and tell my manager that i quit, but i still feel in the right here. i would like some perspective on this and if i'm the asshole here.",3
"if i started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?. i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'

so the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""how do you pronounce that?"" it's tina!

i have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, ""just for the record, my name is tina!"" to lighthearted, ""tina, like tina belcher!"" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, ""thanks tiana!"" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:

chuck: thanks, tiana

tina: no problem, chad!

jessica: hi tiara!

tina: good morning, jennifer!

would i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by this, so i may as well have some fun with it.

edit: i am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so i just want to add a couple of things:

a lot of people have suggested that i gently and firmly remind people of my name. that's what i've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

a lot of people have suggested i go to hr. this is the kind of nebulous thing hr doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

a lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. it is. i have been black for 25 years, and i have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and i can identify it in my own life. it isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. i feel like a few people are almost getting it. a lot of people are referencing that key and peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

and finally, a few people have asked why i don't use tina turner as an example, since she's also a black tina. first, i thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with tina belcher, but i used 'tina turner' as an example for our dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me tina turner, which took deprogramming from his ea to get over.

edit #2:

no, i don't have a southern accent. i'm from atlanta, and black people from atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. more to the point, no accent makes the name 'tina' sound like 'tiana' or ""tiara""

no, the people i work with aren't just 'idiots.' as annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

no, i can't wear a 'hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. we have a business professional dress code!

yes, i correct them every time.

no, it's not because i'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

responding to this post saying, 'okay shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('tiana' being the 'shaniqua' in this instance). several people have alarmingly said, 'okay, trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'chad' is very weird!",3
"for grounding my daughter because she called my sil a ""slut""?. my daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. a boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. i believe he sent a video to her as well. before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. it appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. i notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200b;

my husband and i are respectful and non-judgmental of my sil's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. my daughter is understandably upset and i feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. she unfriended my sil from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. she refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my sil house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. i tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200b;

my sil is hurt from all of this. not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. last weekend, i went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. my daughter refused and referred my sil as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs i don't want to repeat.

&#x200b;

i grounded her for three months and took away her internet. my husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. he also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. he thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200b;

edit: seems like my husband is right and i went too far with the punishment. i just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. i'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. will decide with the husband later. we're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

for clarification, as for my sil's privacy, she didn't consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",3
"for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?. me (28m) and fiancee (27f) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. i also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

on saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. i stayed with my parents but i left the dog with her because she likes having him there. however, *i made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on sunday i get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. she was drunk, so i told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. when i got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. i felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

but then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. the girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

when we got home, i told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. i told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and i'll tell mine. she was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, i get bombarded by messages on messenger, whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that i am insane to do this to her after 4 years. they started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

the logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. nope. they all fucking agree. my mom said: ""well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" lucky me, eh? my dog didn't fucking die!

my sister was appalled that i cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said i might have overreacted. yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. but i am so disgusted at my fiancee that i can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. she isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

by the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. she likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar dangerous things. it's not something i hold against her in the sense that i would ever mention in a fight, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. for example, my dog.

i'm 99% sure i will stand by my decision. but am i really an asshole? literally nobody is on my side and i have no idea what to think.

&#x200b;

**edit: posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. she is negligent and irresponsible and i don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. i'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. if she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, i would also leave her. i guess i realized i don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",3
"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. 

reflecting back i do think that i might be the asshole but i'm unsure so i've come to you. 

i will accept any judgment",3
"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?. my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

so, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. she doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. she woke us up and made a scene in front of him. she said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

i went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn't hurt her, she was following me, i didn't use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn't answer.


update: thanks for all the comments. i talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. i broke up with her. 

also little info: this doesn't happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. he laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",3

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from romania. she had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. she said it completely justified my hesitation. her information was stolen in the equifax breach a couple of years ago.

jack celebrated his birthday in september, and as many of you suggested, i told him that i'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. that way it didn't look like kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy kim's gift. 

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

thank you all for your comments and i wish everyone the best.",3
"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that.. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3
"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson. so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3
"for telling my parents i won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?. i'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. i have a car that i bought with money i'd saved from work, and i pay my own gas. however my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

they said i need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. and the problem is that i get motion sick easily; even when i'm driving. too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when i'm in a car make me feel ill too.

i'm not exaggerating, i've always been like this. as a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. i always make sure i know where my barf bag is on a plane. i always used to take motion sickness pills, but i'm not allowed when i'm driving because they make you tired.

anyway, i can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me i literally feel so sick because of his bo. even with the windows on my side open

my friend told me i should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

so i did that and told my mom and dad that i couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. either they could check or i would. and they blew up at me saying that i was being nasty and humiliating, that if i wouldn't drive my brother i couldn't drive. and i said fine; i'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

and that caused a big fight, because i guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

for what i did?",3
"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?. this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3
"for insisting if i can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?. throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

so i 20m live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend 23f, a guy from my uni course 20m and his cousin 26f. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. 

about six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years 21m. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. 

so the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

my potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?

eta: some questions people keep asking: 
1. if i knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something i'd have included it. i'm not aware of anything he does and when i ask why 26f doesn't like him i just get a shrug and ""just do"". i will also state i'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners i've had. 
2. we don't hang out in the living room much. we literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that i can't get on my bedroom tv and there's nobody else in there. we use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. a lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26f, *not* my best friend. my best friend is 23f. not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago i was moving out of halls at university and 23f was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. at the same time, a dude from my course - 20m - was looking for a flatshare. we couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26f - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. i only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. by chronic fatigue i mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3
"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?. me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

&#x200b;

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"for not picking my girlfriend up for a birthday meal and telling everyone she is probably asleep because she ignored my text. unfortunately my girlfriend's social skills aren't excellent and as a result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.

yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. in the morning i sent her a few messages saying ""what time should i pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. i decided to just pretend that she was asleep and i went without her. when i arrived i just made a joke saying ""i think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. at about 12:45 i got a string of messages asking where i was and what's going on. i just played dumb and said ""wait, you're ready? i thought you were still in bed or something??""

i knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but i didn't want to play this stupid game and i don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so i just decided to not pick her up.

obviously she was mad at me and had no idea how to express her emotions besides bursts of anger and then ghosting.",3
"if i told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?. so my situation is a little difficult so i thought i would confide in the good professional people of reddit. couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. we haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" i mentioned something along the lines that i smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (this was hard for me to tell because my whole life i was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) we both laughed about it saying ""just don't let mom find out"" the joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""i cheated on my wife..."" at first it didn't register until i saw his face and he was dead serious. i for one hate cheaters, but i try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. he begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. she would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. he told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. during this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. he told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. they've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (they have a kid) 
he told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

as stated before i hate cheaters and i've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. i know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. my heart tells me i have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because i've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. my brain tells me it's none of my business and i should keep my mouth shut. i don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. on one hand i betray my brother if i say something on the other hand i betray our close family friend because i know this secret and i don't say anything. i wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. so there it is, if i said something?

tldr: brother cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now i feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. wibta?

edit: i'm referring sil as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are very close lol. i thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just sil, but it looks like i was wrong.

second edit: wow this is on the front page, i never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! i'm sorry i can't reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",3
"for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?. not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. i got called an asshole for it, so now i have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

i met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. two nights ago was our third date and i was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. nothing fancy, i just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. this girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. she's funny, charming, and smart. we had had several great dates and i was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. she is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

our waitress for dinner was great. actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. at one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

at the end of the meal, she brought the check and i told her i would like to speak with her manager. she asked if there was something wrong, and i calmly repeated that i would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. she leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and i proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. he thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

the only one not happy was my date. she said, ""if that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that i was full of myself. she didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. i texted her saying i was sorry for whatever i did wrong and that i'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

so pardon my french, but what the fuck?",3
"for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?. on my gf's birthday i gave her a necklace that i spent $400 on.  i wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but i was expecting something.

here's how it went down.  after dinner she asked me if i was ready for my gift, i said yes and she started giving me oral.  she doesn't like giving oral and i'm ok with it.  she was giving bad oral and honestly i just wanted her to stop, then she gets up and pulls me into my room and we have sex.

i feel disappointed.   i don't think sex is a gift.  i didn't expect a gift that was equal to what i spent, but i wanted a least something.",3
"for telling my son that if he changes his last name then i'm no longer his father?. let me start off by saying my son, adam, is 22 years old. back when my ex wife, tori, and i were trying for kids we found out that i was infertile. we decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. i was thrilled because i thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. no, i was wrong. my ex wife cheated on me and i didn't find out until 20 years later. 

tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. my ex and i divorced a few weeks later. ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological father. he did and they started to become really close. it hurt me much more than i thought it would. 

he's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. they started to bond really well, and all of a sudden adam became really distant from me. it's been like this for almost a year and a half. i try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with chris (biological father). i tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. we used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about chris.

i couldn't stand it. my son who i raised since he was a baby treated me like i didn't matter. any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. what i mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. i'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. he also changed his major from econ to computer science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

i told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. he never did. i told him numerous times and he never changed. he was still distant.

what was the final straw for me was the phone conversation i had with him last week. he said he was going to change his last name to chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i told him this ""i can't believe you are going to do this. that's really disappointing to me. if you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then i'm no longer your father and i don't want to be involved in your life."" 

he hung up on me. i didn't even bother reaching out because i know he wouldn't respond. i stand by what i said. i meant every word and still do. the last name change to me means he no longer views me as a father and views chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

my family told me i'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. i was told to post it here. so reddit am i being an asshole?

info: something to add. after i found out about chris i took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or adam. they didn't contact me. i didn't contact them. i needed a break.

edit 2: a lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and i think i finally figured out why he's been so cold. a few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. his grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that i am fully in charge of. enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. after a semester of university he started dating this girl. he was head over heels in love with her. 

i never met the girl so i have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. suddenly after a few months of dating adam asked me for about $3k to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. i already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. i asked adam why he needed the money. he said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

i told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. he spent over 1k on her in just under a few months. he would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. to me she was just after my son's inheritance and i was right. what i said to him was basically this ""adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. that's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. if you 2 were more serious then i would think about it, but i'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. they broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

he was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. then we found out about my ex's affair. i don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. that was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",3
"for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?. i know from the title, it definitely sounds like i would be the asshole but please hear me out. i have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. my nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (i don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3
"for turning the home i inherited into an airbnb? my sister thought it would be a ""family home"" forever..  i will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. about six months or so ago my grandpa died. for simplicity sake, let's say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. in his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  his estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in california. basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. m

i got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. for the last six months i've allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but i just got my first tax bill and i either have to sell it or start making some income off it. after talking to the real estate agent i've decided the best course of action is to put it on airbnb. that way i can still use it if i like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there's not someone renting full-time.

 my sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all i know she's upset because she can no longer use the house for free. but she's also telling me that i basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. she has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. she also says it's not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but i still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house i could stay there any time i want.  she's my older sister and i've always been impressionable to the things she says to me and i'm feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. am i the asshole here?",3
"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life?. okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3
"for being upset because my son didn't talk to me, but talked to my wife.. i'm 40m, my wife is 39f, son in 15. 

yesterday when it was dinner time i called him to come downstairs few times. he didn't answer me so i assumed that he didn't hear me. i went upstairs and knocked on his door, he said he'd come downstairs in few minutes. after 15 minutes he still didn't come downstairs so i walked in his room. i knocked first. he was obviously crying. i asked him what was wrong but he didn't answer me so i didn't push him more. 

 i went downstairs and told my wife about it. she went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. she came back and brought him food upstairs. when i asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn't anything important and told me to drop it. i got kind of upset because i want to know what was wrong and i'm his parent as well. 

i haven't been fully ignoring them but i've been acting kinda distant since yesterday. my wife got mad at said that i was acting extremely immature.",3
"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager?. so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? i found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like i'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

edit 3: my inbox is so buried i have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. does anyone know what those are ?

edit4: i'm getting a 403 error whenever i try to respond, not sure what that means but i'm still reading because honestly i'm afraid to go home even with the great news i know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? i messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/snausagefest since you're a mod, do you know? i can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever i try. thanks!

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3
"for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?. i am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. they're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

my sister paula's daughter amy is the most successful of the bunch. she's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

i don't dislike amy but she's always been trouble. i have a daughter the same age as her, charlotte. when they were younger amy did a great job convincing charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

when amy graduated, paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then paula has gone out of her way to make amy the centre of attention everywhere. over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. amy wanted to go too and paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from x''. amy behaved like a brat the entire time and paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. i don't mind this but they do, but once again paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

the final straw came last weekend. my son mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. paula, her husband rob, and amy were there, and paula set about trying to convince me to let amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. mark's fiancee vicky barely knows amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. paula said amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

i was frustrated and told paula that amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. i told paula amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying i was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public. 

amy isn't a child, and pointing out the truth is not humiliation.",3
"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged. i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole. 

being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. people make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  it is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. ""they started it"" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now. 

this sub isn't ""was this person in the wrong to do this to me"" its ""am i the asshole.""  esh exists. nah exists. ""nta, but you should still apologize/try better next time"" exists. let's all try and be a little more nuanced&empathetic.",3
"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children. saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3
"for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?. this happened a couple weeks ago, but i'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

i travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. most recently, i was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. this wouldn't be a problem except that i had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket i paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way i had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (because i take this specific route and airline a lot, i knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since i just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

of course, when it came time to board, i get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. i politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before i got there, and would i do her the favor of just switching?

here's the thing: if circumstances were different, i would have! but i explained that i had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that i could sleep. i really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts right then and there. 

by this point the plane is filling up, i'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so i just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. the mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. the flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as i did) goes, ""this is an exit row. your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. there's not going to *be* another empty row. please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

so i sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and i figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, i push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. when we land, i'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""you look like you slept well, bitch.""

so, reddit. am i the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**edited to add:** okay, thanks reddit, i think most of you agree that i'm not the asshole here. but please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. the kids were just fine. they watched something on their ipad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",3
"for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?. i'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. i mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. she embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. personally, i have nothing against this at all. i am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. however, i do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. i don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

however, despite being a ""supporter,"" anna regularly comments on my body type. for example, i always bring food for my shifts since i personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). anna will often say things like, ""you should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""you look skinnier than last week. i told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" she'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if i was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that i look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" one time i was changing into my work shirt in the back and anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" i have no idea what that even means but i doubt it was a compliment.

these hypocritical comments have pissed me off. i enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and i enjoy working out and staying toned. anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. i don't think this is healthy. 

finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy i kinda like came in to get some food and i was super excited to see him. he turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. oh well. anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""maybe he's into curvier girls."" i basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. i asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. then i told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (i called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

she called me insecure and told me i was being a rude bitch. it was reaching the end of our shift so i clocked out early and left so i didn't have to argue with her more. i was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. she said that i was right and all but that i was insensitive in the way i brought it up and suggested that i apologize. i'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",3
"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

tl;dr i thought i had it all but now i just have a lot of eggs.

"for dropping the ""we're not having kids, now stop bringing it up"" bomb on my mil?.  my husband and i don't want kids. my mil is big into family in the traditional sense. she has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

my husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. every time we see her, she asks. everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""we might not even have kids"" and mil would *not*hear it. at year 4, husband had a vasectomy and i had a tubal.

so this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some bbq and drinks and everything. when i get up to grab a beer, my mil asks me if maybe i should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

i was annoyed by this and said ""there's really no chance.""

mil, all wide-grin, said, ""oh come on! it's time for you two to finally get serious! put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

i said ""we've been official for about 5 years now, mil,"" and drink the beer. husband laughs with me.

mil gets more annoyed and says ""well, you won't be real (lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

husband said, ""mom, enough."" mil pushed again. husband repeated.

after about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, i finally snapped and said ""mil, husband got snipped. i had my tubes tied. we're not having kids. you need to stop bringing it up. period.""

well, i thought i started wwiii. she started crying and stormed off. family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. we left. party kinda ended. the social media bullshit started shortly after. vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. some meme about how ""i guess i wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" it's obnoxious to the point that i just muted all of them.

my mil finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if husband and i came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. i told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""well then, i guess you two aren't prepared to be real (lastname)s. i'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (it wasn't that much. it was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

i hung up on her. when recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that i was the asshole here for dropping it like that. but i don't think she was ever going to drop it if i didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. so aita?",3
"for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though i don't need it?. i hate flying to the point that i will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. it's not that i'm scared of flying, i just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

so i only fly if i can buy a second seat (or third if i'm flying with my wife). it lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class and for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. i'm a big guy but i 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

on multiple flights i've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no i bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? if i was willing to fly with one seat i wouldn't have bought a second seat.

note - i do not take two seats on the train/bus ever. they are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so i don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane.",3
"for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?. so my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she's heard good things about. we get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, i'm hungry. 

i look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients i've never heard of. i order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki i think ($18). very important, these were listed as entrees on the menu. mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

so anyway we order as we are starving. my steak arrives and i am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. i joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. i don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. when i go to restaurants i expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

i'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. granted the food was pretty good but i can not get over how tiny these portions are. i'm a big guy and i like to eat, what can i say. 

when the waiter comes back i inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. my girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, i don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

a manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. i don't end up paying as they realized i called them out on their bullshit. my girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. im still hungry so i drive through mcdonald's and get a burger, and when i did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. it's now the next day and i'm starting to think i didn't handle the situation as well as i could have (i could have probably just asked for a discount). my girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now i'm starting to think i'm an asshole.

am i the asshole?",3
"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?. so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

so, i got into cornell last week. honestly i think it was fluke. i'm not smart, at all. i got a 28 act, a decent gpa (because my school grade inflates considerably). i had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like cornell. but anyways...

my twin sister is the opposite of me. she's a genius, she has way more impressive stats (34 act and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. i didn't and still don't mind, it's true. the only reason i can fathom i got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while i applied to arts and sciences (i don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (cornell). she checked as soon as it was available and called me bawling. i consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

well anyways, i pretty much resolved that i was getting rejected, so i didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. well, i guess surprises do happen sometime, because i'm a cornellian. i got in. i just don't know how but i did. 

i really want to go guys. but this would devastate my sister. all week she's been crying and solemn and sad. she's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  she's decided to go to nyu, but she just hasn't been herself. i haven't told our parents (i think they assumed i didn't get in because she didn't). 

am i being selfish? should i just go with her to nyc? we always thought we were going to school together but like... it's cornell. i couldn't in a million years imagine i'd get in. i've been researching obsessively about it and i can't shake the desire that if i don't go, i'll regret it. ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which i would love to get away with from the huge city that is new york). it seems like a dream opportunity. 

am i being a bad sister? i know she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. it would crush her. i really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. for going to her dream school? especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

tldr: dumb sister (me) gets into cornell. smart sister didn't. she's depressed. it was her first choice. i want to go tho. aita?

update: so everyone here told me that i should go, so i decided to tell my sister. 

well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't i tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

but seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. she went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. like uncontrollably bawling. i tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

i going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

update 2: please let me know if my updates are annoying; i only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so i thought least i could do is update 

so after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. it said:

> i'm sorry for how i reacted; please don't be mad. i'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. it's just that after i got rejected, i at least had the consolation that i get to go to school with you and we can go together. but now you're going to be where i wanted to be and i'm just so sad. i worked so hard and did everything i could to go to the best school i can and i just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. i'm sorry i'm ranting i just need more time

i'm not going to lie guys, when i read this, i cried. a lot of you are saying that i obviously i have to have attributes that made me desiresble but i really don't. i don't deserve my acceptance. i did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest ap classes available, etc. meanwhile i see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. she deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. i'm really strongly just considering going to nyu with her. everyone at cornell will just be just like her and i don't stand a chance. and i know if i go to cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and i just don't want to lose my sister :(

update 3: so i told my parents and they did not react how i would've expected them to. first, they tried to insist that cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be impossible; if we applied to the same school within cornell, like we both applied to arts and sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. they couldn't have mixed them up). 

then they went on to explain how i should go to nyu with my sister. i thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to cornell if i didn't get in. my sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would i not go to cornell, and they said how it was unfair that i basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. i don't know if i'm being dramatic, but that hurt. i knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that i don't deserve my spot sucks. even though they're probably right.

i stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. she asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that i 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. my parents were shocked because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. this started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. i'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. i realize that i have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. i'm glad i have my sister actually believe in me.

i still don't know if i want to go to nyu or cornell, mostly because i just don't want to go to school without her. she's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. at the end of the day, i always thought the nyu was going to be the school i was going to, so i wouldn't lose much by choosing it over cornell. i'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. thanks again everybody for your comments; i wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that i got in.

update 3.5: no new news but i just wanted to say that i'm reading every single comment and i apologize if i don't get to you individually and i appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! you guys are amazing :)",3
"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?. for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3
"for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?. my sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  i was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. she got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. she said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so i can see how long it takes her if i want to know so badly. so, i did. i got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later i was done. i guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what i did in half an hour.  she once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine i lied about how long it takes because i hate cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

"update to for telling my disabled son and his partner i disapprove of their relationship?.  

my original posting: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_disabled\_son\_and\_his\_partner(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita_for_telling_my_disabled_son_and_his_partner)

my son has moved back in with me last weekend.

the older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

i got a phone call from my son on saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

i jumped into my car and brought him home. i also yelled at the man and told him i'm calling the cops.

i then called an officer i knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

when we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

so while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

i'm happy he is rid of that predator but i'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

i have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

i hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

thank you to everyone for telling me i wasn't completely crazy.",3
"for sending my son to school in a dress. my son started second grade last week. i get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

he's got a twin sister. i told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. my son picked one up and said ""i want to wear this."" i'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. i'm pretty politically neutral so while i wouldn't say i was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that i could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

i figured ok, i wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so i shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

i drop him off and get to work. three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. he was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

my wife is irate asking how i couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and i was setting our son up to fail. so is just about everyone else i've run this by. my wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and i was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because i was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

at the time, i truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that i put my son in harm's way so now i'm not sure whether i made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. aita",3
"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?. a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3
"for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (about $700). i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3
"for telling my grandma she looks like ronald mcdonald because she wouldn't stop telling me i look like a bull with my nose ring in?. edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought i'd make an edit. my piercing is not a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (i don't agree with that) but i have my hoop in my nostril.

here's how it happened. every time i see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" the last time she said it to me i politely asked her to leave it alone or next time i wouldn't be so polite. to be fair this is the first time i spoke up because i'm not confrontational but the older i get the more i stand up for myself. and for that matter, i shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. i immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like ronald mcdonald. a lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but a) i warned her and asked her to stop and b) she's insulting my appearance so why is what i said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? i'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. i'm a grown ass woman and i refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.. throwaway, and i will be keeping this is anonymous as i can, every name will be fake. 

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, i'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. i assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if i knew the reason they broke up. i said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, i was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day i was scrolling through facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with jon's permission i posted all the screenshots on my facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me i have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, i've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that i'm now ruining my sisters life.

i've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him.",3
"for catfishing my underaged sister on tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?. last week, i was using my sister ashley's phone because mine was dead and i needed to call a friend to confirm plans. dialing my friend's number, i saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. immediately, i asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

i decided that i wanted to have a little fun with this. i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so i didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. to test if she was just using for fun, i decided i was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. i asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) kevin if he'd mind if i used his pictures and explained the situation. he thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

i created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so i was definitely more suspicious of her now. i superliked and less than an hour later, she matched and messaged me. 

i decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". she was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. she told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

after she left, i told our parents everything and showed them all of the messages. they were pissed, and i suggested we all go to the restaurant. my dad and i just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""jim"". my dad went up to her and said ""jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. i told her that there was no jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. my dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. we were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

i told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said i was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. my other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. wondering who's right and if i went too far?

edit: yes, when i asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with jim. that's why i went the extent that i did.

alright after reading all these judgments, i came to the conclusion that i'm ta. but i'm ta she needed. if anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. 

and to the people who said she'll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",3
"for asking for pocket money because ""i am a kid too"". i am 19f, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. i am still studying so i cannot pay rent yet, but i do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


my father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. they have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. that plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. i had been arranged to join the kids' group, when i tried to protest they insist that i am a ""kid"" too, so i just had to submit to my fate. clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


so i spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. that includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to science park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. to be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when i sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(i admit, i am not really babysitter material). the kids seem to like me, so i guess it went well too. however, i still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


when my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. now, i don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes i can easily earn in a few hours, but i am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, i was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


i put on the biggest smile i and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. they were a little taken aback. i said as sweetly as i could that i deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. in all awkwardness i got my pocket money. needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


i got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. in their words, i am a major ah to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. aita?",3
"for propositioning a girl in the gym?. please hear me out before you judge because while i did say what you're thinking i didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

the gym i go to is very small. not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. this means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. yesterday i (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (one would do a set while the other waited beside them) the girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""ugh i hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

i shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. i was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so i'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

the same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

at this point i call her out. i said ""oi, you."" she immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. so i called her out again specifically ""you in the purple top."" 

she turned round and asked what i wanted. the following conversation happens:

me; do you want to fuck me?
her: what?!
me: i said do you want to fuck me?
her: what the fuck is wrong with you?
me: well you keep staring at me, so i'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

she went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. i carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

when i told my friend what happened, he said i acted like a dick and that as a woman i should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. he also pointed out that i embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

my defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

i'll admit that i'm a pretty confrontational person and i could have reacted better but i also think she should mind her own business.",3
"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?. using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

edit 2: some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. they're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

final edit: some of you wondered if i would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and i wouldn't have a problem. 

talked to my niece this morning. she and i are totally fine. knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. i apologized for my actions regardless. 

asked why they broke up.

the guy was cheating on his wife. he confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. has three kids. all her age or older. she dumped him.",3
"for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?. title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have candy crush on her phone.

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

"for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?. my sister is 16 and heavily overweight. she's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. she's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! i'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the edm and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely hated it all. the other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

as a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago i decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. for breakfast i made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. i make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. i mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. i have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

it was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. she started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where i told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (she thinks apple pie is healthy???) my mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but i really think i was making an honest effort to help? i feel bad for yelling at my mom but i dunno, was i really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**edit:** i really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. i just want to emphasize that i'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, i just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. i will try to be more self-informed in the future. i've taken note of her possibly having arfid, thyroid problems, or pcos and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, i feel bad that i've made such a horrible impression of her. she has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, i made a comment on this post detailing how i did the cheese sauce and stuff. thank you very much for your suggestions, i really appreciate them.

"for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?. i'm 19f and live at home with my family. my younger brother 'mike' is 14. he is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park"". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

one of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
now yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

my boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",3

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

"for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto fb who died during the 9/11 attacks?. i lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when twc towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). i had no calls or texts from her, all i hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. this year i suffered a near-death accident. after it, i did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways i decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people i am close with. 

so for this year, i posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my fb. it was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). i wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""i'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who i am. i hope you are proud of me.""

a few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. she asked if i  loved her or if i wanted to get a divorce. she told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my fb. of course i love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so i felt guilty and took down the post. was i out of line here? i genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, i just wanted people to know what a great person my late-gf was.",3
"if i quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? i would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. ex wife as well.. so years and years of backstory here. ex wife has bpd and life with her has been a continuous struggle. we are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. but she crossed that line and enough was enough. divorce is bitter and ugly. 

for financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. i implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. the both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. then getting mad at me when i said i had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

i've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. on a lark i called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in nm. he said i'm hired. i talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. with the 50% id have to give my ex wife i could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. i could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

"for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when i found out the child wasn't mine?. my ex and i had been together for 2 years.  it was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  i also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually i broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

a few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  she was practically beaming with glee.  i agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  didn't want my child subjected to that.

the one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  she very happily agreed.  her reaction actually washed away some of the fears i had about her possibly cheating on me.  so she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  we find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped i honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

this was a week ago.  she moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  she, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how i'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  that i have plenty of room in my home and i should just help her out.  i feel like i've been through the emotional ringer these past months and i've been though every emotion i am capable of feeling.  from realizing i was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly i feel so emotionally raw and sometimes i agree with them.  that maybe i should take her back and just care for the kid.

"for filling a few faux amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?. this has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. there are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... i have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. the first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a bluetooth speaker.  amazon replaced all my packages and i would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so i decided to fill a few packages with chihuahua shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. i also taped notes that said "" dear children, stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. or am i a diabolical genius?",3
"for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?. my 19-year old daughter vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever see each other besides a few quick weekend visits. moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

i told her i was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. but i maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

the problem lies when vanessa asked me for money. you see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, i decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). that combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

since i gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. i told vanessa that i was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

she now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in it). she said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

i told her i cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. if/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, i'll be happy to contribute the money. but it's not just a free handout.

she's got really mad that i rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. to her credit, her brother and i have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while vanessa was more the troublemaker), but i do love my children equally. i told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiance, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. that if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, i will fully support it financially.

well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. my wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but i told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and i rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and when she has to move back home. i don't want her to think i support this decision.

she told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my vanessa, she's staying out of it. i, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. for sticking to my guns on this?",3
"if i played ""another one bites the dust"" at my brother's wake?. my brother died. he was an incredible, funny guy, i miss him like i lost one of my limbs. maybe it's stupid, but i want people to remember the person he was. my dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very catholic funeral service. he wasn't catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. he'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

thanks again.",3
"for telling my daughter 26f that i 55m will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad 50m.. my wife and i divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since i was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. i knew from many stories i've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. this may sound immature but i made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that i was her only father and to not betray me. but i have no control over what she or they do in their home. fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. she has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me i would be the one to do it. even though i know they're very close, i don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. i am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. i got a bit angry and told her i absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy i barely know. she told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that i'm being petty over something that happened years ago. i told her i wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but i won't be there to see it. 

i was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so i wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",3
"for laughing my ass off at my wife's expense?. just for context, i am 6'2 and my wife is 4'11. she is insecure about her height and while i try my best to tell her that she is stupendously beautiful the way she is, she got bullied about it pretty bad and it's just an aspect she doesn't like about herself.

with this in mind, we recently went to one of my favorite places to eat. now, this restaurant has a really large counter and my wife is petite, so the cashier couldn't really see her. 
we ordered our food, and were heading out when the cashier held out a giant piece of candy and said 'for your lovely daughter' to me.

i honestly couldn't help but burst out laughing to the point that i had tears in my eyes and i had to compose myself before driving back home.

"for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?. context: so a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""jan"". i am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. i'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


recently, we had a watch party at jan's apartment for the michigan football bowl game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. my buddy and i were talking about whether our qb should declare for the draft or return. i said ""i sure hope he comes back, dylan (our backup qb) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

jan has a huge crush on dylan and didn't appreciate that i called him skinny. 

this caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""you would die playing football. tbh i don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

at first, i took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. i usually got my leg pulled about my physique but i never took it personally. until she started making it personal.

""look at you, you're like one of those starving african kids on those tv commercials""  (i'm brown but not african)
""that's why dylan is a chick-magnet and my ex dumped you. you look malnourished""

she kept going and now i was beginning to boil. i wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. but then i snapped.

her: ""go lift some weights. it's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

me: ""if you could tell me what your current diet is, i'm sure i'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

her: ""what are you trying to say?""

me: ""i'm saying that if i'm a malnourished african then you could be on the biggest loser. and i'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

her: ""no wonder ex didn't want you. go fuck yourself.""

me: ""and no guy wants you. the last dick you got was moby dick. fucking whale.""

at this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

since this was at jan's place, i figured i should leave (michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). i finished my beer and left. i got a facetime from one of my friends who is jan's roommate. she urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and i went too far. i didn't feel that way and i don't want to apologize.

am i the asshole?

"for asking my wife to have an abortion. my wife and i (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. we don't have any kids and don't want kids. we had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. she's on the pill, but accidents happen. she said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. naturally, i was surprised by the news and her change of mind. i asked her if she considered getting an abortion. she said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. she told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. i told her i wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. she started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. she wont answer my phone calls.

i'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. i was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. i know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but i can't help but have a negative view about it. a few years ago i tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but i couldn't. i was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. my wife is aware of these points.

i just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. i also don't like kids. my wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows i wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. i understand why she thinks that, but i still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little i would be involved in raising him or her.

for asking my wife to have an abortion?

edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. if she ever wanted to stop taking it, i would support her 100%. i realize that i'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. it honestly never occurred to me until now (i think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). i see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. i'm going to get snipped asap.

edit #2: she and i talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. here are the main takeaways:

* i apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. i also apologized if she felt like i was pressuring her when i asked her to have an abortion. i didn't mean to pressure her, but i know words aren't always received as we intended. she said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows i was totally caught off guard.
* she apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. she said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes i don't feel like she tricked me (i don't).
* we mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. we've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",3
"- i missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me. this might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

i've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. he's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. he's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

my daughter was graduating from college last year. a week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. i was obviously incredibly proud of her. she asked me to come to it and i said i would. 

her college is two hours from here. i hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. right as i was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. i couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. i'd left my daughter a voicemail saying i wasn't going to be able to make it. 

she called back that night absolutely livid. she called me a shitty mother, said i had two kids but only cared about one, that i'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. she said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. she hung up and that was it. i've barely spoken with her since. she didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. she hasn't shown up for holidays and i've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. she's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up i might come now. 

- i've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. i know i wasn't a perfect mom growing up - i didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. i'm heartbroken but i don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",3
"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding?. my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3
"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich?. my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3
"for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face. my newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. it requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

enter lady with four kids: a newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). she really really should have brought an ipad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. the mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. she was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. ffs at one point when i wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. my newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and i did not feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

i tried being polite about it ""sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""ma'am!"" -points to kid- the lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. rinse and repeat. i told her she needed to stay with her mom. little punk deadass says ""i don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


finally, i'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? why is your baby crying! make him stop! i don't like that"" and her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. so now i'm out formula, kid still screaming, and i have a huge mess that i don't have a great way to clean up. 

i'm at my wits end. i raise my voice at this kid. ""look what you did. i am not your mom, i am not your babysitter. you are bothering me. get out of my face!!"" 

people looked at me like i was the biggest bitch on earth. a lady speaking spanish actually did call me a bitch. the little girl starts crying. i'm not apologizing. the mom confronts me, i tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill i'm prepared to die on.

"aita: for not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?. i (f20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

the last time i lived here was 2-3 years ago. back then i remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn't want her boys to see it. 

now it's not like i was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

anyway i never stopped using the toilet bin. 

now i'm back she's started a new thing. moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that i keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when i'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

i personally think i absolutely should not be hiding the fact i have a vagina and it bleeds. her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. i would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. and i just want to be comfortable in the house i'm living in.

edit: for more info, this isn't a random house i've moved back into. i've lived here since i was 3 before my parents got divorced when i was 7. my step mum and her kids moved in when i was 12(ish). i moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

"for being cold to my ex-fiance and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?. so, right now i'm in kinda a shitty situation. i've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. all of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but i don't feel that way, heres the story.

i knew my ex for almost 10 years. we go back all the way to high school and have been friends. after we graduated i said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

these past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.

suffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.

i've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to ""reconcile"" i've shut it down,

my friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. i disagree fully. but i could be wrong. am i letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",3
"for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?. my former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. as a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so i was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. she (now laura) has not started hrt yet but is living fulltime as a woman. laura and i no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

ever since i moved out and laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. she's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

i am fine with what laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

i tried to talk about this privately to laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. my son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. the moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. people were obviously listening and when i gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because i was jealous of her confidence. to make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that i was a piece of shit for saying what i was. my son and i left in tears but laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

ever since then i've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and i was a bad person for asking laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. i'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if i've gotten old and out of touch. it just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. for speaking to my ex this way?",3
"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers?. i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

update: gonna check out here, i think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. a few reminders for people: i'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3
"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?. necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3
"for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   i've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. you can skip to the tl;dr if the exposition is too long.

she's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which i honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. she can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

if you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' when someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(it doesn't stop there, she knew i had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as i walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. it's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

that's not it, either. she *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, bam, i'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

it's gotten to the point where i don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, i've saved up more being with her than i ever had in any other relationship. the only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

our anniversary was recently, and i had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so i suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""i'm not learning how to make sushi because then i'll *never* get a real date ever again."" we ended up going out instead.

it kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. she's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like olive garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that i'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because i've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

she also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste i've ever seen so i kinda think it's just an excuse.

i just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

tl;dr: so, reddit, am i the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because i practically have a private chef of my very own?

edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, i just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

edit 2: i'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. i'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

edit3: no, twitter, i don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. i buy her herbs and succulents. what flowers do i buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

also, yes, i wash the dishes

#final edit:

okay guys. this will probably be my last edit. this post exploded unexpectedly and i've tried to respond to as many comments as i can, but there's just too many of you. if you've asked me a direct question and i haven't answered, i'm sorry. my inbox is a mess.

i really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and i can honestly say that i've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. it's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

so her mom picked up the girls and i took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. she was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and i apologized for being stupid. after, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so i asked her to marry me.

she said no. she did it kindly, but she still said no. she said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

i'm pretty heartbroken. i thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

so, reddit, you were all right. i'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them?. i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

i told cliff what they said and he just looked at me and laughed, and then said ""don't concern yourself with what they say. they're childish"". so i dunno...aita?",3
"for ruining jeans for women?. i work at an office where i'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" she frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

problem is, for the past few months that i've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. that is, until a few days ago. 

i love wearing jeans, and have always felt i could make them professional too. i was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. she said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

i said ""well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""no they don't.""

then, my coworker, amanda walked in wearing jeans. i pointed that out. my manager confronted amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

in the moment, amanda appeared playfully mad at me. but i went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but i think she may actually be mad. i apologized, saying i didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

aita?

edit/ update: wow, did not expect all of the responses, though i can't say i'm surprised about the polarization. at work today, it wasn't bad. only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. i do feel bad that i ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day i will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",3
"update: for not adhering to the wedding dress code. so i posted about a month ago about my sister requesting i wear a long sleeve ankle length black dress to her lakeside wedding in summer, while being 9 months pregnant and i've gotten many requests to update

"meta at any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.. this seems like a really weird meta post, but i just wanted to warn people that captain sparklez, a youtuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole trails episode talking about this sub. it's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

i *am* the asshole, i already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. sorry, teenagers, but i kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. i wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but i would also be looking at their advice differently if i knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3
"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?. i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

am i the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?. i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3
"for telling my wife that if she quits her job i expect her to cover all the housework?. my wife wants to quit her job. she wants to be a sahm to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


in order for her to do that, i would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on saturdays. i told her that i if she quits her job then i expect her to cover all the housework. i may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. i will will help out on weekends but during weekdays i rather rest. 


my wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and i am being lazy and discriminative against women. i don't really mean that, as i think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. i will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. aita?


edit: i admit that i did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because i was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. ofcourse, i also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",3

"if i report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to hr for basically slut shaming me?. i've \f21\ recently encountered a new sexual partner. we used a condom, but after words i felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time i have ever hooked up with someone i just met. my previous sexual partners have all been someone i have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. while condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a sti, it cannot provide absolute protection. a few days ago, i noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an std. i have never had one before and i have no idea the symptoms, but an std was all i could think about. 


i went to an urgent care because i wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or uti) and if not, i wanted to send my urine off for an std screening.  my doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which i was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


it came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. she says based on my symptoms, i am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and std screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


as i'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" i sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""with all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". i looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". at this point, i was pretty fucking angry. you could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. i thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

i was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn i get slut shamed for it? i posted this in a forum about sexual education and i was getting advice to report her to hr. i don't want to go after anybody's job, but i don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

will i be the asshole if i report her to hr or should i leave it alone?

edit: for everybody asking, i was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. i just kind of stared at her because i immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information i shared with her so openly. so after a couple of seconds she said ""i appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so i just said ""thanks"" and left. i was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. trust me, i wish i would have but i wasn't even thinking about going off on her. i was just embarrassed. 

also, she was a nurse practitioner. i know a couple of times i referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was np. 

and for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that i'm having more fun than u 😘


update

before i start off with the update, i want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) i am not heartless, and in the original post i even directly said i did not want to go for her job. that was never my intention and i even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. i also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody i just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. in game if thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. so if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) for teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. what you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

now to the update: 
i called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or np supervisor. they didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the nps was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

first and foremost, i explained to the manager that i in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. i did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or pip to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

i explained to her everything that happened and before i could even say who the np was, she knew exactly who i was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

i then explained how i confided in her and that i came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. i explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers and future interactions with her other women patients. 

the lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. she also said she was placing a note and that the np wouldn't be back in the office until next monday. 

with all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! you've truly been so helpful. 

and for the people calling me a slut for this, i hope to god this same thing doesn't happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",3
"for not letting my kids go on vacation with my ex because it's my time with them.. so right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because i won't give up my appointed time with them. my son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200b;

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200b;

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200b;

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"".

"for flipping at my husband for spending thousands of dollars on a football game with his buddies, without telling me about it?. for starters, i'm a 26 year old woman, my husband is 25. we also have a 2 year old son. we both work full time and make good money, he brings in more than i do, but i think that's besides the point. we also have a joint account. so fast forward to the game, apparently he decided to take it upon himself to take him and 3 buddies to a game with a party bus, great seats, etc and all the other shenanigans with a sports event. he makes a lot more than his buddies and he wanted to ""have a good time with them"". when i checked the account, he spent over 4 thousand dollars! my jaw dropped when i saw it. i confronted him about it the day after and he told me that ""he's able to because he makes good money and it's not gonna break our bank"", he then went on to say to me that i don't get to choose what he spends his money on. i was super pissed and was like ""it's our money"" and we've got bills and a child to care for and support. he continued to tell me that i was the one in the wrong and that he's a responsible adult who doesn't need to have his purchases ""monitored by his wife"". so my question is aita?

edit: i appreciate the support, this really has hit me pretty hard, i feel like i've been betrayed. i'm new to reddit btw. it's making me feel like i'm not of equal importance in this family. i've been with my husband for 6 years and i've never felt this way before.

"for telling my mom she's a whore?. throwaway. long time lurker, first time posting. 

i am the oldest daughter of 4 children. i'm currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

when i was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. i, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

this has put a strain on my mothers and i's relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
she didn't even try to keep it a secret from the kids, i remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and i'd see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. as a kid i didn't understand, but as i got older i realized what she was doing in front of us and i feel sick. 

people ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this ""family friend"". they split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

i've confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. this was roughly 3 years ago. 

my mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. they exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. i read the messages and it's very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she's just catching up with an old co worker. but i know my mother, and i know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. i mean it's been years, why else would you want to catch up?

my new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn't agree with it, it's been years, he wasn't in her life yet.

she asked me what i thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. she asked for my honest opinion about the matter and i told her; 

""to be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy's marriage and you guys had 4 kids. idk why you think it wouldn't ruin this one, but why don't you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?""

she cried, said she couldn't believe i just called her a whore and left my house. we haven't spoken for a few days.

today, i got a call from my siblings saying i hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy's marriage was between them. i disagree, i had to witness my mom cheating on my father, i watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. she asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she's selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? sorry i'm not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",3
"for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last name?. my teacher doesn't like my first name and always talks about how weird it is, and how my last name should be my first. so she took it upon herself to only refer to me by my last name, on tests she'd even cross out my first name when i wrote it. i kept telling her i preferred being called by my first name, but she laughed it off. so i started calling her by her first name, the first time she was shocked but after a month she just kept yelling to me how i was being really disrespectful. i've gotten numerous detentions because of it, but i don't want to stop until she calls me my first name. so if i keep calling her by her first name.

edit for more information: i have an arabic name and live in a country where majority of people are arabs. i should also clarify that in my country we already call teachers by their first name (ex: mrs. name) however i stopped addressing the mrs and only call her by her name. the country i live in isn't very well, and school systems are upside which is why it may be different then everyone else's.",3
"for refusing to share my extra income with my wife when she didn't share hers with me when she earned more?. when my wife \32f\ and i \32m\ got married eighht years ago, she made about 15k more per year than i did. our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. my wife was the one who insisted on this, and although i was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), i agreed since she felt strongly about it.

&#x200b;

a few years after we married i decided to go to law school. long story short, i ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. since i managed not to go into debt, i have a good bit of money left over after i make my contributions to our joint expenses.

&#x200b;

my wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that i get to buy most of the things i want while she is on a much more limited budget), and i told her i would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. i think fair is fair since this was her idea, but i do wonder if  i am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?

"for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?. so this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so i figured i would bring it to the group to see if i'm the asshole or not.

my boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  i absolutely hate it because i am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

for an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  we live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  we were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

a few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, i told my boyfriend that the event started at noon, not 1:00.  and just as i figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  we show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

so last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  i had lied about what time the event started.  i know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if i can lie about something like that, whose to say what else i'd be lying about.  i told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that i don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if i'm 'hiding something'.  i explained that i only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  in my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

he doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one i lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

i've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but i just have to know if i'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.


edit:  so i posted this before i left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  i certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.

though i haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, i'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.  whether you think i'm an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point of view of the situation and i appreciate that.",3
"if i record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?. my neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the tv. i've gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. we have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. they also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. it's actually turning me off sex. i find them insufferable. 

 as petty revenge, i'm considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they're loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. i feel they know i'm mild-mannered, and they're taking advantage - that since i'm not a tough guy or something (i'm a young woman), they don't care. 

i'm in australia, and i'm pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.

"for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?. my daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. she has been begging for a nintendo switch. due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a switch. money isn't the issue... it's her behavior; she acts very entitled & she's lying left & right. i just don't feel now is the right time for a switch.

the theft: 

on easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband's aunt & uncle's house. aunt & uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we'll call her cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. she lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn't get many upscale things unless they are a gift. well, cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. she eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

my kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. she snuck it out of aunt & uncle's by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. she proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when aunt & uncle called & asked if we had seen where cousin might have left it.

due to cousin's challenges, she was utterly distraught over her missing gameboy. it's one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

i'm disappointed about the thievery, but i'm even more upset over my kid's attitude about being caught. i only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. it wasn't until i sat there & thought about it that i knew she was lying to me. once i told her i knew it had to be her because of xyz did she finally confess. her behavior only got worse from there. she refused to apologize when uncle & cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like she was the one being wronged. 

i feel like i need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing is not ok. i think that purchasing the switch (with my daughter's help from money she would ""earn"" by doing extra chores) & having her give it to cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

i mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... birthday... i don't really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. what do you think reddit?

edit: thank you all for the replies. i just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

also - i do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. not sure how or when, since i have a so to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***edit: i'll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying i'm ta for being a lazy parent. our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and i. my husband and i are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. he and his family hardly ever tell her ""no"" to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. i assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",3
"update - for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. a few months ago, i posted this post( https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/achoyx/aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting_to_go_to/) asking if i was an asshole for not wanting to take my girlfriend out to restaurants. it blew up. it ended up on twitter. people shared it to facebook.

the general consensus was, yes, that i am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. a couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. more than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. 

well.

after i posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. she started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.

then one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, ""do you seriously fucking think that i *actually like* eating at olive garden?""

guys, she saw the post. she was *furious*. 

she doesn't like olive garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. i was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, ""she never developed a taste for pasta, she's latino, do i ever see her make pasta? no. a meal isn't complete without rice. you don't know me at all.""

she yelled about olive garden for a solid twenty minutes. it wasn't just about olive garden, but it was a lot about olive garden.

long story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. she ""loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage"" from me for her own personal betterment.

 so, yeah.

tl;dr: i ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. i didn't take her out on dates and i didn't pay enough attention. i would do anything to fix everything.

edit: to clarify a few things

1. i didn't post on april first.

2. i say that she yelled about ""mostly olive garden"" because she did. she was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over olive garden, where the kids are catered to.

3. she did not call herself latino. she calls herself latinx, but i thought latino would be less confusing. guess it just made me look like a dick.",3
"for being mad my girlfriend took my keys?. my lovely girlfriend and i have been together for 8 months. she slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

my issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student id to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

i asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my id on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. i told her that i didn't appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. we started to fight about it and i ended up asking her to leave.

since then, she hasn't answered any of my texts or calls. when i told my roommate about this he said that i was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and i yelled at her about it. i think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. aita?

edit: i thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, i get that she was being nice but why couldn't she have asked??

edit 2: and no she still hasn't responded to me

edit: i'm at work now obsessing but i know that i screwed up. i had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess i'm projecting or something. and no, my girlfriend hasn't responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money i tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it's early in my time zone

final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. i brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. we had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  she chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

also, i am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",3
"lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging. asking for blunt honesty here because i can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if i've been an asshole and if so i'll go and apologise. 

i'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). my mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. in particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

this women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. they have a long long history of bad blood between each other. both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. obviously i think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

anyway even though i really dislike this women, i have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. she's my father's wife and 2. she was close friends with my mom. my wife was livid at finding out about this and insists i put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

so for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. i keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. i try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and i wont hold it against her. she refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

so a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and i lose my tempter. i tell her (paraphrasing)

""just shut up already. you don't get a day in this. you don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for christs sake. just leave me alone already.""

i did not say it calmly. i yelled it and was definitely angry because i'm busy organising my mother's funeral. she has gone off crying and i'm left wondering if i went too far.

i can't deal with this nonsense and i'm just going to accept whatever judgement is given and go with that.",3
"for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a japanese downpour?. my friends and i went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

we're from england, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in japan. it is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. i warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. they were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

i warned them multiple times that if it rains, i would not let them borrow my umbrella.

one friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. i reminded them that i would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

roughly an hour later, it started raining. hard. it was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. i stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). when we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. neither were particularly happy.

"for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? my family is derisively calling me ""scott's tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.. edit: for all the people asking, scott's tots is an episode of the the office, the plot is michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. he assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. the episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. i've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of tv ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. i've watched the office 8 times and i skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. parks n' rec is a better show though...fight me. 

so how do i begin with this. i am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. my grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who i call niece because i truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. the condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise i would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. the stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (i really hope this is making sense). basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do i get to keep it long term. 

my cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to university of arizona so she can start next week. either they didn't know or didn't care about the gpa requirement because when i asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. i don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 gpa. i asked her how she got into uofa and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

i basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my grandma's will and that i will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

that's when all hell broke loose. my mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. my sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that i'm running my own version of ""scott's tots"" because i taking away money that was promised for education. there's also an undertone that i'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so i can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

no amount of explanation is helping. i've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can i keep their shares. if they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. no one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and i imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

there is really nothing stopping me from doing it. i write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what i'm doing. 

i have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the scott's tots thing because i don't want to be seen like that. 

would i be the asshole if i withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

edit: just for my own notes since i'm saving this thread and i guess if might help other people be clear.

cousin a (nieces mom), 38: paid.

"update: for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?. og post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

it's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and i guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

in my last post, i stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. at this point, i would like to clarify that my family and i are chinese and it is common in chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. however, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. his business was a passion project on the side. my dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. despite the chain of advice i sent her, she ignored me still. i regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. i was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then i received a call from my parents!!! according to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. she had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. my mom was very tearful as well. they scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and i believe she went in the next day.

i had no idea what made her finally break and return home so i texted her (first, i told her i was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. at first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. lmao. what a fucking asshole. glad my sister finally returned to her senses. she told me she broke it off with him and i sincerely hope that's the truth.

this past monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. according to my mom, she was begging that they do is asap, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

the future seems pretty bright right now for her. my parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and i think it'd be great for her). she's officially starting next monday. i'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

tl;dr: sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and mcdonald's. sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

edit: forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. i urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",3
"for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? they've just found out and are acting like i've betrayed them.. my children are 17 and 14 respectively, and i'm hoping the fact that they're teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

my husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. no one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

i had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. it was at an aa meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the us. 

i have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. i like to joke that i'm keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. i've had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- i am so damaged that i just feel lucky that i got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

we had two children- two sons. we'd never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it's a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
he has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

my mother in law told the kids this sunday gone, as she decided it was 'time for them to know'. she didn't consult us before telling them, and certainly didn't do it in our presence. 

since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they've been prodding their dad asking why we'd never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they're acting like we've kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

my 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. i broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing i'd ever heard him say. i asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

he told me that it made 'so much sense' why we were abnormal, why we don't drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and i feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children's lives as a result of us staying quiet. i am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and i don't know how to proceed. i have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",3
"for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?. so i'm 17 and i used to be morbidly obese. i was actually morbidly obese until last year when i decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. i'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and i feel really great. i went from 130kg to 70kg and i'm 5ft 9

anyways my sister eats horribly. she is morbidly obese. my parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

anyways i saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. the sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. my mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. it's absolutely insane i think and there was nice coke can to go with it. i told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. i offered her a piece of tofu in which i was having for lunch. tofu is actually delicious. more people should try it.

 she told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that i'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when i was a child(i wish someone did). apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. my mother said i wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

was i in the wrong?",3
"for not shaving my legs for work?. so i'm a 21 year old female. i feel like i should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out i rarely shave my legs. i'm straight, i'm very feminine, and i just don't like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. also i'm not a hairy person at all! you can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. the only time i shave is when i'm dating a new guy in my life and i've been with my current bf for 3 years now. also he doesn't give a rats ass if i shave my legs. 

so i work for a promotion company where i travel and work at event and festivals. but today i had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so i stoped to say hi before i left out. 

when i ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. i said sure and came in and he shut the door. he was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. i was in literal shock. i was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. my boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained i didn't shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that i wasn't being hygienic. i was even more shocked. 

i told him i didn't understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. i asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. i then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this i'd prefer hr to be there and he just told me that we didn't need to discuss it any further. 

later today i just got an email from hr saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. i'm freaking out and it's making me so anxious.
for not shaving my legs for my job?

edit: so people giving my boss hate i understand but i'm not mad at him and don't blame him. im not sure but i feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn't even force dress code and stuff. but also i really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since i've worked there 8 months with no incident.",3
"for ""tattling"" on my boyfriend to his mother. my boyfriend and i have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. he'll sit on the couch and play video games and he'll only tend to her while she's screaming if i tell him to. even then, unless i'm in the middle of doing something right then, he'll ask me why i can't just do it instead. on top of that, he only holds her if i hand her to him while he's watching tv and she's calm. he stays up late playing video games but still won't get her when she cries, so i have to get up with her. we've talked about it multiple times, to the extent that i've told him i can't handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

i'm honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. i put the baby in his gaming room and told him i was going out. in reality, i just went to the gas station because i felt like i couldn't trust him, and sure enough when i got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. i took a ~10 second video of this and after i comforted the baby, i sent it to his mother with an explanation of what's going on.

she called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he's upset with me for involving his mother and for ""taking a video out of context."" i'm at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but for sending the video?

edit: the pregnancy was an accident but my boyfriend wanted me to keep it.",3
"for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?. i've known james since we were 11. he's been my best friend for a long time and we're so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike and even share a last name. he lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

i had a crush on him growing up and i asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. he always declined and said we were just best friends. he's really goofy with me, and treats me like i'm his little sister and over time i came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. my parents treat him like a son and honestly, he's family. 

a couple months ago i had a ons and found out i was pregnant. being as i have pcos i am over the moon because i was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. i am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and i cant explain how many tears of relief i shed. i've always wanted to be a mom and finally i have a chance at this. i have my own home, have savings, i'm in the right place in life and i'm so happy. 

when james found out he was also over the moon. he thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. won't go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn't feel like going to the mall, can't come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

my mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one i cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. he confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. he said 'i know it's really weird of me but it just creeps me out' 

i found that so demeaning and hurtful, and i burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to gtfo. he apologized and left and i haven't heard from him since. i'm so upset that he's ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! i want to reach out but i just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and i'm not sure if i'm the one that's being difficult or if it's him.",3
"for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?. a very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. i've never objected to people crossing our land as i'm an avid hiker and don't want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. it's basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. so she'll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it's a multi day hike). 

it made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. it ""feels like"" 40-45 degrees celsius during june-july. today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. they said they were out of water and asked if i could refill their water bottles. i told them i could for 50cents a bottle. the reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). we aren't connected to an endless supply of water.

they were furious that i refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. i told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (i've drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted i top them up. 

they had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. so i refilled the young girl's bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. they refused and very angrily went on their way. my wife says i should have filled them up, but imo so long as the little girl is okay i don't think they deserved anything given their attitude.",3
"for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?. let me preface this by saying that i (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. i've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. this is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. i'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

now, i've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. her beds bigger for starters and i cant cook at home because it's always congested, so liv and i cook a meal twice a week at hers. she has a roommate who we'll call (bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. i've tried my best to get to know bianca but it's not reciprocated and i can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. she's never asked a question about what i do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

liv told me that bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. i hate being the cause of her discomfort. whenever i'm at livs house, i don't use the living room and go straight to livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). besides cooking with liv, i'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

here's where liv and i may have screwed up. we were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). all of a sudden bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
we both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

their relationships gone down the gutters since i came along and i can't help but feel responsible. 

on an end note, liv and i want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

my mates telling me i'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and i should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. but i see it as the next step before moving in together, that i'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. so aita?",3
"for yelling at my sister in law?. context here: i'm an ex heroin addict. the why and how isn't important, but i got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. i'm 26 now and completely clean. i don't even drink, except for on special occasions where i'll have two or three drinks at most.

now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before i had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that i'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. the first year or so, i understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. however, it's been almost six years since i was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that i'm gonna stay clean.

she's very vocal about these concerns, too. if i get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks i've relapsed again and i'm having withdrawals. she made a huge scene on christmas day two years ago because i had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that i must have been doing a ton of coke. if anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. i mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

i went away recently with some friends. on the first day of my trip, i dropped and broke my phone. because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced i had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. when i got home, i found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. it was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and i sort of flipped at my sister in law. i yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that i'm incapable of staying clean. she got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but i said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. at that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. i'm being told left and right that i'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and i need to apologise, but i'm still upset that she evidently believes i'm incapable of doing this. aita?",3
"for making fun of my boyfriend's penis. upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). in the privacy our relationship, i playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. however, he has complained in the past about how much he hates ""locker room moments"" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. 

so the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. one of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and i write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". they were all read aloud and when its revealed that i wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. my boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

after we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. he said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. he said that by making that joke, all i have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. he wasn't mad, just disappointed. he said that he would never make fun of me if i had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me i was beautiful no matter what. 

i felt really, really bad when he said that. i have apologized and things are fine now but i think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? am i the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",3
"for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip. ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which i pay for by myself, as i make enough money to afford it and i didn't want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
we also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn't want to go through that again in this one.

the fact that i pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course i pay in part for). also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother a lot about our lives and future plans.

anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. however, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across south america which she was going to go on on friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

first i asked if i could come, to which she said no because she would be ""discovering herself"" on this trip, and when i asked why hadn't she told me she said because i wouldn't have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (which is mostly true)

well an argument ensued and at some point i finally put my foot down, it went something like this: 

gf: ""why can't i just go explore the world and live life to its fullest""

me: ""you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out""

i believe it was the right thing to do as she didn't pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn't have any right to demand to stay, plus i was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

that night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am i really an asshole for this?

tldr: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, i kicked her out my house.

"for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend's aunt in front of everyone?. i know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! 
i'm a native french speaker from canada, but i have a very pronounced ""acadian/chiac"" accent. for those who don't know, it's pretty much a mix of french and english with some local dialect thrown in there. pretty common in the maritimes, where i still live. i'm perfectly bilingual in both languages.

i started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks english, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they've all been really great, except for one of his aunts. she says she was a french teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in france, and she insists on only talking to me in french. i agreed at first since i didn't want to be rude to his family but it's getting super weird. i don't understand how she was able to teach kids english or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like i have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope i'm right because it makes absolutely no sense. (example: she said ""a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche"" which roughly translates to ""to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth"" when she meant ""this pumpkin pie tastes delicious"") 
she constantly criticizes my ""accent"".  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me i need to ""pick a language"" when i accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper ""français standard"" is actually getting harder for me since i've been only studying/working in english). 

so last night during dinner she started going on about how acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total bs, and obviously weirdly directed at me. for the rest of the night i stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like i didn't understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. i wasn't trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the french and ignored me for the rest of the night.  
turns out she was super pissed and told everyone i was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. looking back i think i might've taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and i feel bad. my boyfriend said i was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. here?


edit: forgot to mention that i told her a few years ago that it's hard for me to fully speak proper french as i spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain acadian culture (she wasn't having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",3
"for completely ignoring my father's girlfriend. it's more like ""are we the assholes?""

we have known her for 2 years. she mixes our names up all the time. at least 3 times a day. we know she's doing it on purpose to annoy us. 

so. yesterday i was in living room and she called me my twin's name. i just ignored her and pretended she wasn't there. then she called me my name and i answered her normally. my brother did the same, we did it few times. now she's mad at us, apparently we're being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes ""honest mistake"" sometimes.",3
"for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though i'm not religious?. i'm an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

i have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. i would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

they get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don't need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

i used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work i do. she couldn't give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

even though i'm a known atheist i decided i too wanted some time to meditate everyday. i told my manager i needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. she initially said no, and then i got a hastily written email saying of course i was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. she'd obviously checked with hr and covered her ass. 

for the last six months i've been having my 30 mins 'meditating' out in our company garden everyday. this has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have 'meditative time' and it's causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

i recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that i was being rude and 'ruining it' for everyone else and that at xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. i told her i'm not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",3
"for stranding a date without a ride because she was ignoring me?. so last weekend i went on a tinder date with a girl who i've been chatting to for a while. it was our second date and i thought things were going pretty well.

we end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which i recommended. it was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. i awkwardly try to join in but i'm basically ignored. i leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. they're still chatting. i stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. they back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

at this point i go out and grab a smoke. she comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn't seen this guy in ages. i tell her that's cool but i'm just gonna head home soon. she asks me to wait for her bc she doesn't have a ride and it's far from home. 

so i wait bc whatever, night is ruined and i might as well just hang out. i wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her i'm going home and she can either come with me or stay. i see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. i try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. i gesture to her that i'm going and she holds up a finger like ""wait a minute"" and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

i've had it at this point and i just text her ""leaving now, bye"" and head straight to my car and leaves. i get frantic calls about 15 min later. she asks me where i am and if i could go back and pick her up since she doesn't have a ride and her friend doesn't live close to her like i do. i say ""no"" and hang up. 

anyways the next day i get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. she's upset because i left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can't get uber/lyft for some reason. she calls me a pos and to never call her again and that she'll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me.

"for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister?. first of all, i know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.

my girlfriend and i were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. we are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. we are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. the same home. because our parents are married.

it's my mom and her dad. both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. when we were in hs we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and i being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.

honestly, i hate being in this situation. even though i know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". i think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. my (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""what did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" but i see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. my girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. we can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.

this living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. i love this girl and have spent my life with her. i want to spend the rest of my life with her. i just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.

"update if i don't go on a second date with a larger lady because she doesn't match her tinder pics?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/axpo27/wibta_if_i_dont_go_on_a_second_date_with_a_larger/

hey again everyone. i finally have answers.

i never gave fake names to anyone so my date is now alice and her sister is gabby.

on saturday i got a facebook message from gabby. it boiled down to ""this is stupid, will you meet alice so she can properly explain?"" i try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on sunday i go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. 

she was cute, my crush was strong, but i managed to sit down with a decent poker face. she pretty much burst into tears the moment i arrived. lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and i really nearly bolted bc i felt so awkward. 

gabby was the one to suggest alice use her pictures. alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on tinder. all of herself... and she was bigger. 

i feel really fucking dumb. still. alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on tinder without scaring everyone off. so that's why gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if i'm being honest, not that i care. never did just thought i was being lied to).

when i sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. i'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. sucks to be all those other guys i guess because i'm taking her out this weekend again. 

i'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but i don't know. maybe i'm being dumb? she's real sweet and we share the same hobbies and she's even pretty when she cries and my pa always told me that's how you know you're in it for the long haul and holy fuck i need to calm my crush down. this feels like high school again.

and that's that. just wanted to clear up the catfish fiasco since i got a good many comments and pms. thanks again for helping me set my head on straight.",3
"for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?. i found out i was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. when i told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if i had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. i was already living independently, both my boyfriend and i worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. in our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so i thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

during my pregnancy i asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when i started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when i wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when i was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. they refused, telling me that i was expecting to be catered to. they also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that i was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that i was making dumb decisions"". when i spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that i was trying to get gifts from them. i had severe post-partum depression and thought i was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. my relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. they told me they were afraid i was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

which brings us to today, 3 years later. my sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than i did when i was treated ""as an independent adult"". our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff i have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. i answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. i've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

"if i tell my girlfriend she needs to bring her own food to my house and pay for the food she has eaten?. i want to start off by saying i love my girlfriend and i'm scared that if i give her this rule or expectation it will make her feel unwelcome at my home. we have been dating for awhile now and she's always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn't eat much so i always gave her the okay. after she had spent a week at my place i told her she doesn't have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn't eat much since she's smaller but i didn't take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. she left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. i feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. i can't comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me's so often though since she's here at minimum 2 days a week. she has brought up in the past the fact that she feels i don't take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and i work 3 (not by my choice). i feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she's always making sure i'm taken care of and comfortable. i don't know if i should just suck it up because she's not taking much from me and if i'd be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. wibta?

edit: wow. i think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. my gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought ""haha this reminds me of me and joycemanner!"", saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. all within 20 minutes of making this post! she thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

edit2: to answer some repeated questions: i made this as a throwaway account. the account name is based off a pretty popular band (joyce manor) i like so, i didn't think she would realize it was me. i'm 26 and she's 20. her name is not joyce. i don't think she'll come on here to give her side of the story.

"for letting my date pay for dinner?. i 19m asked a girl 18f out to dinner. when it was time to pay, she said ""i got it"" and went into her purse. at that point i literally had the receipt thing in my hand. i thanked her and handed it to her. she hesitated a bit, but she paid and we went home happy (or so i thought).

so from my perspective i really can't see what i did wrong here. from asking her out until receiving the check, i intended to pay. after she offered to pay, i thanked her and allowed her to pay.

the next day i woke up to angry texts. she said i put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. i asked what she wanted me to do differently. apparently i should have argued/insisted that i would pay. my friends agree with her. now i'm wondering if i should just apologize and pay her back.

"for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?. throwaway for obvious reasons. basically i m42 got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. i got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""andy, sara, kate"". i had these tattoos all done at once after kate was born knowing she would be my last. my oldest child andyt22 came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. my wifef41 immediately supported her and made sure that i would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. it was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. i'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to athena. 

the problem arose yesterday when my wife and athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. the tattoo going down my arm still reads ""andy"" and not ""athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. my wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but i explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""andy"" to ""athena"". i told her i would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which i can not afford either of. i explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that i don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if i don't support who she is, i just need to leave her life. my wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if i don't ""get my act together"". i personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

"if i back out of donating my kidney to my ex-fiancee's brother after my ex-fiancee and i broke up?. for five years i dated a girl i'll call mia. we got engaged last march and were supposed to get married next year, but two weeks ago i learned that our entire relationship was a lie. someone showed me a dashcam recording of her saying that she still loves her ex and she was only with me because i'm the better choice. i confronted her, she admitted it was true, i called off the wedding and broke up with her.

i'm determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that i should have achieved had mia not wasted five years of my life. but there's an issue that has me on the fence: i was supposed to donate my kidney to mia's brother tom, and now i don't know if i should do it.

tom has esrd and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. i'm not that close to him and i was only going to do it because i wanted to help mia's family in any way i could because i though they were going to be m family. but now that i know that she was just playing me the whole time, i'm having second thoughts. organ donation is a big deal, i will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point i don't want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.

"for wanting a sunrise wedding?. every year on our anniversary, my fiance and i wake up early to go to the beach and watch the sunrise together. it's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. 

we decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). after that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from canada, but that's unavoidable.

based on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.

we've been getting a lot of backlash from our families about this, who say this is way too early and we need to move the ceremony to a more ""normal"" time of day. but my fiance and i don't feel like we're asking for anything that unreasonable. aita?",3
"for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?. i (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. we met on instagram, i followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. i thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. she makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

however, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. she has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. as soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

this really annoyed me, i get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. if she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. she just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. i just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

on the way home, i told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". i told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks i'm an asshole.

"for being a ""karen"" about my car being ""fixed""?. my car was shaking when i braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and i believed him but the deal i got the car from has free diagnostic so i took it there. 

so my dad was right, it was the rotors. my friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. so the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). i said ok. 

he calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. i asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. i specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

he calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so i needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. i said i told you not to cut those and he was like ""i was just tryna to help you out""


i'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. it's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). i pay and leave. my car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. i bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. we get into and he's like i'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. i tell him i'll get a lawyer cause i'm not giving him literally another penny, i paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


i ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. pick the car up the next day and it's good. 


i told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said i was a ""karen""

"for being upset my mil won't make a ""family quilt"" for me and my husband because we have no kids?. my mil has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). the quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. i was really looking forward to getting ours because i admit i'm a bit of a hipster and i love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

she recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and i thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. i asked my sil (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. i was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. turns out mil has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

i message her directly about it because i'm just that kind of person. i like hearing it straight from the other guy. mil says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. i ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though i know it's a lie. i push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

i ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. i tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""i'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. i hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

but now i got a really mean voice message from my sil telling me that i crossed the line and am acting like a huge b\*tch for no reason. i'm shocked because i have a great relationship with my sil and she always defended me from other family bullshit. my husband wants no part in this now. for what i said to my mil?",3
"for basically telling my ex girlfriend that she's not as hot as my current girlfriend?. my ex (24f) and i (24m) dated 5 years ago. we were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. she and i shared the same circle of friends so i continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and i distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. i'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. i'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but i no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.

this past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. i have a new girlfriend (23f) that i have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. i never thought i could feel this way about someone). i invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.

at the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. she came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. i was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. she then says to my girlfriend, ""hey did you know me and ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""yes, i'm aware"". ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. my gf said ""wow, i'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. i was angry, i truly don't believe i ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes i do find her more attractive than my ex. i told my ex ""i'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". 

she went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them i called her uglier than my current gf. i told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me i could have been a little bit less harsh. ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. am i the asshole?",3
"for telling my niece she should wear deodorant?. my niece is 12. she's going through puberty. 

i pick her up from school or dance practice sometimes when her parents are working. 

i've noticed over the last few weeks she's been smelling very ripe. 

i was driving her home one day and said (this is abridged) ""hey i know you're going through a lot of bodily changes right now and you're really growing up. i think it might be time to start wearing deodorant.""

she said ""i smell?"" and i said ""yah, just a little. no big deal. just pick up some deodorant, your mom has some."" 

her parents called and were furious saying she's going through a difficult and sensitive time and how dare i make her insecure about her natural bodily functions. 

i said ""sorry, i thought if roles were reversed i'd want someone to tell me. are you really saying you didn't notice her smelling like bo all the time?""

"forbidding my wife from using my daughters old room. this has been an ongoing argument between my wife and i, but it resulted in a huge argument today and i'm starting to wonder if i'm in the wrong. i think it's impossible for someone in my position to see my wife's point of view fairly so tell me who's the asshole here. i'm also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it's solely this topic/argument that i'm interested in hearing your judgement on.

so my wife and i have two kids together. but before i met my wife i had a daughter with my now ex-wife. my daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. we haven't said a word to each other in almost a decade and i have no desire to speak with her anyway.

i still own the same house as then and i've pretty much left my daughters room as it was. at first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it's kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? i can't really explain the logic behind it because i don't think there is any. it just doesn't feel right to change her room.

this has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and i have really had. the house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there's my daughters old room. my kids know not to go in there and it's just left there. occasionally i will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. it's therapeutic in some weird way.

my wife has always wanted to change the room. at first it was because she wanted a study, but i refused and eventually she gave up. 

we're now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. again i put my foot down and said that wasn't an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 she really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. she was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. she was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. she said a lot of things but i think that basically sums it up.

when she said these things i was really hurt. but i've had a few hours to think it over, and i think i might be the unreasonable asshole here. it's not fair to make my kids share a room because i won't let go of the past. it's not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn't my first love.

"for inviting my atheist friends only for the wedding party and not the ceremony?. edit: didnt expect this to be a reason to be called a ""child molestator cultist"" but i suppose that's reddit for you?

i am getting married in a few months. we have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so i thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. my future wife and both of our families are roman catholic. catholic ceremonies are *long*. i'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual ""getting married"" part. if you are not a believer, it is boring af. hell, im catholic and i know i'll be bored for 80% of it. i thought i'll spare them the trouble.

anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying i forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. so i said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. she got confused, i explained and she got annoyed to say the least. said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. i tried to explain again & fix things but i felt guilty the whole time. 

was it an asshole move?


edit: ah, i suppose i am ta. just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. no hard feelings between us. 

- those who i decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to christenings, first communions & confirmations) so i thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

- i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of ""they invited me so i have to"" and ended up going wrong about it :/",3
"for singling someone out at a comedy show?. i do stand up. i also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

i mentioned at work that i couldn't do any shifts after 4:00 on saturday because i had a show. my coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

i had no problem helping him out and i knew this club wouldn't care if i slid a couple people in. but i've been trying to get more bookings at this place and it's kind of a level up from the sort of places i usually get to perform at so i told them, you know, ""please make a point to laugh.""

i'm up there doing my show and i see them and they're the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren't laughing. it bugs me a little but i didn't want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. then i see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

so i start telling a joke about a time i gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as i'm doing it i'm slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes i'm talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn't notice or look up until i'm literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

it killed, so that was the good part. but when i showed up to work i was expecting an apology from him. instead he was expecting an apology from me for (i'm quoting here) ""inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke"" ""making him look like a fool in front of his girl"" and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

he basically summarized it as ""you're supposed to be a professional and if you couldn't handle me texting you shouldn't be in show business.""

i think, without question, that he's the asshole. but he doesn't believe me and the only people i could tell this story to and ask to confirm i'm not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased.

"- mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage. i'm really upset with my wife after what she's done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. so i'm posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

i've been married to my current wife for three years. we dated for 2 years before getting married. before meeting my current wife i had been married to my ""high school sweetheart"" for well over a decade.

my late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. it was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and i didn't start dating again for several years after the fact. i never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

i've always had a momento from my previous marriage. it was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. she gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. before meeting my current wife i would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

when i met my current wife she wasn't comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. so i started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it's an extremely important item to me. for a time she accepted that until recently.

over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she'd bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding i get rid of it. i can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but i had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... why can't she accept it's very important to me?

long story short, when i was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. when i found out i broke down because it was literally the last thing i had to remember my late wife.

 i don't know. maybe i am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. aita?

"for ordering jalapeños on my pizza intentionally to stop my wife eating it?. first up, i love my wife very very very much but damn does she drive crazy sometimes. i'm a big dude, i'm 6'4 and i'm always goddamned hungry. i'm a firefighter so i'm always on my feet and simply put, i just love foooooood. my wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will always help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it's just the right amount of food that i want to eat but she'll go ahead and take some. 

i've asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she'll get really defensive and say 'it's just a little babe, you'll be fine!' except i'm not fine, i'm hungry. and then when i'm hungry i get hangry and i snap at everyone cuz i'm goddamned hungry!

things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice
to her, so i gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst i held the goddamn plate and then when i went to get myself some all the cake had finished.

lately my mil gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can't stand spicy food.  i tried that yesterday, i ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. she said no. i went ahead and got pepperoni and jalapeños, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn't eat it.

for telling my british neighbors they should learn chinese because we live in china?. i saw s similar post which inspire me this. i'm albanian and i live in guangzhou china. i live in an apartment building that's filled wit mostly chinese people and one british couple. they've been here 3 years longer than i have and can't say anything other than nihao and xiexie. they constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which i told them to stop and start learning chinese. i taught myself to be half fluent in chinese before i got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months i've been here. they managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic english but they left. i told them that they've been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. i told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying i'm an asshole and i'm making their lives difficult. i told them i'll start speaking to them in chinese and albanian from now on,3
"for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?. i'm 26m, my sister is 28f. we're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. i'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. despite all of this, we're not particularly close. we live in the same city but i might see her once a year in passing.

to make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. she said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and i was the only person who could help. i couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. she took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. she left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

it took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. he was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. they took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. i have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. i can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

i'm just not equipped to handle a kid. my home isn't child proof, i have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. i work full time, i'm in school. i couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. i feel like i let my sister down but first and foremost i believe she let her own child down. i don't know what's going to happen.

was i the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, i wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. never mind i don't even have a car. i'll admit i could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

child services is what its name implies, here where i live it's called facs. they work with families in struggling times like this. i told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. they left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because i'm not the parent. even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

i didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. i contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. my best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. i don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

and i can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one i contacted can offload the work for me. it's been 8 days and no word on anything: if i took eight days off work with no telling when i could return, i might as well not return.",3
"for telling my mom she's the reason i don't want any kids?. i (23f) am the oldest of 4 siblings. my dad passed away when i was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

there's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. so when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. if i had to guess i'd say i spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. plus an hour or so on chores. 

now i love my siblings, and i love my mom. but from when i was 14 till i moved out at 19 i had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. all there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

i'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. i've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. i've politely told her i don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

when she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after i told her to stop asking) i told her ""giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" i didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

she cried. i told her i don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. i didn't apologise. 

aita?

edit: when i said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" i wasn't trying to be malicious. 
a) she at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why i had to. 
b) i called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, i had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

i wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why i said it that way.

edit 2: yes, i'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. i was there. i never said i don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. i'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and i don't want kids because of that.

edit 3: for the people pming and commenting about how it's my fault i didn't have friends and not my mom's: i wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

last edit: for everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

actually the last edit: my mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean i only watched the kids till 06:30. i usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work.",3
"update: for arguing with my wife over her preferring to sleep with a body pillow over me?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d8c3ic/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_over_her_preferring/

so a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

she texted me asking if i was looking to buy a new bed and i said yes without thinking much of it. she then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

we sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and i apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

she said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. i told her this isn't necessary and that i would deal with it but she insisted. 

i've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. the new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. she switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. a lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


thanks to everyone who pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

i tried to emphasize this as much as i could in the comments but seriously my wife and i never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on saturday and it's been going well. feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

but yeah, everything's fine now. to be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. i barely remember but i think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

seriously i love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. she's honestly a really good person!

i made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so i remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

thanks everyone :)

"for not punishing my son after he came up with a pretty elaborate plan to ""peep"" on the neighbor girl topless in her back yard?. lots and lots of ugly background here but i'll try not to wander. my wife i have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in may. i have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

on monday i came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. i asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. they said they were playing army and since i've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, i knew their parents wouldn't mind either. so i told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case i needed him to come down. i was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. so they did this every day this week until thursday when my daughter came home from her cit job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if i was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. i climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where i assume the girl had usually sat. i told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

this morning i got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son saturday morning. we sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. i tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and i've gotten them to stop. my wife asked if i planned on punishing him, i said that i don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. my neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. i told her that was really overkill. my wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and i asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. my wife has texted me that i am being incredibly irresponsible and if i don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. in all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!

"update for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?. original thread(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/)

my wife went yesterday to collect our winnings and they shorted her $500. my wife is of the timid type and didn't want a conflict so she took the reduced winnings and had a few choice words but otherwise didn't contest it. they gave the rest to jessica. they made up a fake story to her that they made a 2nd place prize on the spot and jessica won it, thanks to the generosity of my wife and i. this was all bogus.

we made a post on our community facebook page saying we had a great time at the competition but didn't appreciate the comments we received or how we were treated. i guess jessica's family got wind of this and contacted my wife to meet up earlier today.

jessica's family gave us the money back and while they were excited at first, couldn't take it under false pretenses. they found it condescending to give jessica a prize just for having asd. it was a joint decision between jessica and her parents.

we talked a bit and learned jessica only joined because she's writing a cookbook for an asperger's syndrome organization. she's apparently an avid cook and has trouble keeping everything consistent every time, so it's half for her and half for this organization. part of why she went to the competition is to raise awareness of the cookbook itself as well as asd/ass and hopefully win, of course. we didn't know any of this at all, and i guess this is why the organizers wanted good pr.

my wife asked her if there was anything she could do and she can. she's going to help out where she can or if jessica needs assistance. things like editing, photography, etc. i guess everything turned out okay for everyone in the end, except my contempt for the competition organizers.

ps: here(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/em15ywu/)'s the recipe i used, a lot of people asked for it in the previous thread. here(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bjai4e/update_aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a/em7gekx/) it is rewritten to be less ambiguous/more info.

pps: yes, i know ""mentally handicapped"" isn't the right verbiage. i've learned a lot about asd in the last few days. i only kept it to be congruent with the previous post. autism and asperger's in particular may not always or ever be a mental handicap, i should have said disabled instead judging by a few comments.",3
"for removing my birth control without consulting my husband first. sounds bad, but going to preface this by saying i'm not tryna get pregnant without my husbands consent 


i went to the doctor yesterday because i've been super emotional and my body has been out of whack and my doctor was basically like ""we gotta get this implant out of you"" (i had nexplanon, the implant in your arm) and i decided to give my body a break from hormones and to use condoms/ other methods for the time being because i don't want to conceive.


i call my husband and tell him and he's like ""oh ok did you get on the pill?"" and i said no, i didn't want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said i need to be on birth control because it's the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced i'm like trying to get pregnant without his consent. should i have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)

"for asking for the gift receipt to return offensive baby clothes?. yesterday we had a baby shower. long story short, one of our family friends thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written on them. for example: 

* ""all daddy wanted was a blow job"" 
* ""i'm with the milf"" 
* ""to-do list: eat, poop, suck some titties"" 

there were like 2 more but i don't remember what they said. when i opened the gift i was humiliated, i thought it was really inappropriate. before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, i just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" i was mad about the gift because as i was opening and before i could read what they said, i unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. anyhow, at the end of the party, i asked the person who gave it to me if i could have the gift receipt to return them. i said i definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes. the person basically called me oversensitive and said i needed to take a joke. i handed the gift bag back to them and said ""alright, well then you can keep these."" they were super offended by that and thought it was an ungrateful gesture. aita?",3
"for not accommodating a vegan guest?. longtime lurker here. hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

so my wife (29f) and i (29m) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we've lived in our current city. we like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. we have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it's become a great tradition in our social circle. 

our friend james started dating his girlfriend sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that sarah was vegan. i thanked james for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. he agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. everything was fine, until now.

during our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. my wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn't push the issue. 

however, after the meal, james took us aside privately and told us that sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. he added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

my wife feels terrible that sarah was so upset and apologized to her and james profusely, but i don't agree that we did anything wrong. i like sarah very much as a person and i don't have anything against her dietary choices, but i don't believe it's fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. for the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. aita?",3
"for wanting my girlfriend to wear makeup and take care of body hair?. i know how the title sounds, hear me out. my \26m\ gf \24f\ takes forever in the bathroom. upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. when i playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago i was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. she said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. i told her that i got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that i also do to stay presentable. her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. now she's saying i have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which i find crazy as i'm not her sugar daddy. why should i pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

i understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. i haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am i enforcing any ultimatums. if, as she says, i've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. if we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should i pay? anyone who says i'm ta, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? be honest with yourselves.

**gf's side:** he keeps being a dick about how long i would take in the bathroom, so as he said, i quit things he didn't even realize i was doing. no makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, i have curly frizzy hair so i stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. do i look like a beast? sure. am i a comfy, smug beast? hell yes.

he rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so i obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. i'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that i stopped, i feel like... why do i ever have to do all this shit. it's unfair. and if i have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. i conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. conservatively. he should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. otherwise it's not fair.

**both:** we love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. we recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**edit (from bf):** alright, i'm the asshole. you know, it wasn't even the people saying i *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying i wasn't. no way in hell do i want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think i'm not ta then i definitely am. my girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". jesus. the amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that i'm not ta and the reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

i think it's reasonable to say that i'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case i would either pay up or we break up. however, luckily, i am still very much into her. i would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and i think those who pointed out that i should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. as i said before, this was never a fight. and for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me i can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**edit 2 (from gf):** thank you, reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. he let me shave his legs. he said he feels like a dolphin. i've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (i didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",3
"for taking back the birthday gift i gave my sister?. so, i'm 24m. my little sister is 14 and has always been interested in art. i moved an hour and a half away when i was 18 and we 
don't see eachother often, but i make a point to call/text


it was her birthday yesterday and i thought i'd splurge since she's been going through a rough time. she's changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won't talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. i've made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.



anyway, i got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called copics. i'm no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who's anybody has them and our parents don't wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they're about 5$ per marker) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. whenever we've texted recently it's been her ranting about them not getting them for her.

even on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. she barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. i was excited to give her the gift but the second i opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying ""see! even he knows you should've got them for me!"" which i awkwardly brushed off. everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like ""oh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite."" ""a plaid skirt. wow. i'm blessed."" 


i was prepared for an angsty teen, but i soon reached my limit. our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled ""i told you both exactly what i wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit i don't need! fuck this!"" she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.



our parents were a lot less well-off when i was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, i accepted them like i was the luckiest kid ever. i would've never swore and yelled but she's been very spoiled.


i talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. they think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. i agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?


sister came back to get the markers, but i took them back. i said that she was ungrateful and i wouldn't tolerate it. she started screaming at me but i just left the ""party"" prematurely with the gift in tow.



my whole family is blowing up my phone because i ""ruined her birthday"". in my eyes, i spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. this will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. but my family doesn't want to hear from me until i give it back. considering i've got my entire family shitting on me, i have to wonder if i did make the wrong choice. so, reddit, aita?",3

"for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?. my boyfriend and i have been together for about 2 1/2 years. we live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. we have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. i wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but i do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when i can. bf doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

for reference, i am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. he is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

on sunday i went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. if you're familiar, it's 13er james peak in co. it was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). i had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. suffice to say, i was pretty hungry by dinner time. i made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. when it came time to eat, because of my big day, i grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. we're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

bf got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. he told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. i told him that i'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

he told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. i said that i agreed, but again, i'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. he told me i should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

we've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). so far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. i think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

"for telling my brother to stop complaining about child support since he chose to have sex with a woman he barely knew?. my brother (26/m) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits.

i had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. i told him for the first time that it's his fault. he chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. he got mad and said it's not fair because women can abort but men can't, i told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. he called me an asshole, but i was just being honest.

i just woke up and i'm surprised at all the hate messages i've gotten from other guys. i am a man. so many of the hate messages assume i must be a woman because i believe in sexual responsibility. wtf is wrong with men today... this shit is weird.",3
"for not honoring my son's punishment?. update 2: i told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. yes, i told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, i had to crack the whip. let those two eat each other alive. they deserve each other.

update 1: this hilarious. my son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my day. i was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. i can react in so many ways...


his mom and i are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. cordial, but indifferent. our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

we have 50/50. she requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. i agreed even though this ate into my time with him. apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. i won't see him for three weeks. i am not saying not to punish him. 

punish him when he's on their time. 

i have no problems with him when he's with me.

i refused.

i already made plans to make most if the days that i have him and i'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. i don't care much for step-dad anyways. what i do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

also, i don't want to set precedent where i am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.


edit: update: my son called him a ""freaking asshole."" my ex calls him the same thing when they fight. her words, not mine. he learned it from her, not me. i don't open share my dislike for her husband. maybe an eyeroll, but i'm too corporate and professional to do it in front of my son.",3

"for leaving my fiance over his reaction to me getting a student suspended. i am a librarian at a prek-12 school. i lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.

for any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. a lot. it's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. they don't realize what they're doing. usually i just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but i don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.

one day, i was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. he stumbled and grabbed my chest. again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""looks like ms. aitaitaita is letting the boys cop a feel."" i went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out and grabs my boob. i could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and i took him straight to the office. the principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. the suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.

i told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. he said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. i pushed back because i think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because i weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. he also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" i pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me i should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.

i tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and i felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so i decided to break off the engagement. his friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. aita?

"for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?. throwaway account.  we were at a local restaurant last saturday evening. this is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. there was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  there was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. a beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. there was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

but as i watched i noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who i assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. in fact, i'd guess the 4th girl consumed most of the mom's margarita. i mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. full disclosure that i'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. so i mentioned it to the hostess. a short time later a manager (i assume) came and asked to see the girls' id's. the girl with her own drink produced one. the second girl who had been drinking from mom's drink did not.  i did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. i assume they were asked to do so.

"update: for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?. the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c0xp8l/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_wig_to_my_friends/?st=jx7kr9p2&sh=bd95d6aa

so first of all, thank you so much for your replies and advice! i'm writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because i want people to see my friend isn't actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.

i texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don't live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). it turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. like i said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. she's also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. that's why she told me she couldn't pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when i told her over the phone. that's also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren't covered. it turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn't want to tell us that because she's already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law's money. (apparently it's her fiance's family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) 

that's why her reasons didn't ring true to me as well. she didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. she assured me she thinks i look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought i look bad. 

i know people will question how i can believe her, but i've been friends with her for nearly ten years and i give her the benefit of the doubt. we've been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. 

i'm still side eyeing the plantation wedding but i didn't tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fiance's family i didn't want to pile on. i do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. i went to the plantation's website and they do acknowledge slavery's evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. 

i did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and i explained why. she was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. she wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn't even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. she's kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times i've had to point out something she said could be hurtful she's always been understanding instead of defensive. 

i decided i'm going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. it'll still be pretty short, so that's okay. she's fine with that too except she was worried i'll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fiance's family. i reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair i've pretty much heard it all. by the time we hung up i felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship.",3
"for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?. title is pretty self explanatory. but basically over the weekend, i had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. she's babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. she gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

her laptop no longer switches on. she's blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. i told her no as it shouldn't have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. she's refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she'll never babysit for me ever again. i really don't feel as though it's my responsibility.. aita?

edit: yikes this blew up. a few people have asked for more info. yes, i packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. i supplied everything he'd need for the weekend - including nappies and food. my parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she'd be able to spend time with him. it wasn't just 'babysitting' but more enjoying time with her nephew. i gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as 'payment' for watching my son. every other time she'd had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",3
"if i don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins?. 

some background: my grandfather just passed away at the end of january. he was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

this is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. his only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. but to my huge surprised i was named as his sole heir with life changing money. with the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

here's where it gets even stickier. my mom passed away 6 years ago. she had one sister who i was fairly close to and from her i have 3 cousins. i don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" i have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and i don't know if they ever met him. to be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like i did. cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral i set up for my grandpa either. 


now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that i split the estate 5 ways. 

this is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
no matter what i shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. if i do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

i can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. the first attorney strongly advised i do this. 

i do nothing. i am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. this is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

but this is not about the legality of the situation. this is about what should i do and would i be the asshole if i keep the entire estate for myself. just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. i have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. i could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. 

basically, if i don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?",3
"for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day?. so, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.

&#x200b;

i've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. i love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. she is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  i will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). one of her big beliefs though is with holidays. she still celebrates holidays with the family (christmas, easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""money"" side of things. we're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

last year in june my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. i was a little hesitant but i agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. all of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. i obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. all of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. she's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. we fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

&#x200b;

am i being unfair here?",3
"for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents?. my son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  they are both 16.  her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and i pick him up in the evening.  i will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

the mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  it's her house.  most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  he is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .wtf?  and she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  they also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  whatever.

regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   well, today she came over for the first time.   the night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  i am a correctional officer and was working that night, so i wasn't home to take the call.  my son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   i don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  my husband agreed.

thing is, we don't really care.  i was sexually active at a younger age than them.  my son and i have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  he is a lovely boy, and i believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  they have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  anyway, not only did i not check on them constantly, i told him that as long as she was willing, i would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  my husband and i actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and i asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  good friend laughed and agreed.   turns out it wasn't needed.   dad eventually came and picked her up.

i absolutely stand by my opinion that my son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but i am kind of wondering if i should have made that choice for someone else's child.  i kind of feel guilty, but i think her parents are way over the top control freaks.

"for 'promoting religion at work'?. i'm a man with a hindu background working in the uk - that is to say i'm not very religious but my family are and if they're doing something related i don't mind joining in. it was a diwali this past weekend which is a pretty major festival in the hindu religion. 

i had a lot of indian sweets left over, and so i decided to bring 2 unopened boxes and leave them in the break room. at the end of our morning briefing, i stood up and said 'hey, it was diwali yesterday and so i brought in these sweets. help yourself and happy diwali!'. 

what was meant to be a nice gesture to ingratiate myself (i only started a fortnight ago) has left me seething after a meeting with hr. apparently, referencing diwali was akin to promoting a religion and therefore inappropriate at work. apparently i'd also given out hindu sweets (this i find ridiculous as they are just indian sweets with no religious connotations).

to me, it's no different from saying happy christmas which i know this company has no issue with, as evidenced by their christmas promotional video i watched in preparation for my interview. 

to be clear i know i'm not ta for brining in sweets, my question is to do with the promoting religion bit. i'm pretty sure i did no such thing, but it's possible i'm being blinded by my own involvement in the issue.",3
"if i don't let my daughter put a lock on her door?. my daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.  she says it's to keep her brother out - who barges into her room every now and then to bother her - but i'm not sure if the benefit is worth having the lock in place.

i don't like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and i'm worried she's trying to hide something from me or that she'll take the opportunity to lock me out. i admit that i've forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that i see no reason as to why she'd need a lock. 

the way i see it, it's my house and i am simply unwilling to have any locks put in anywhere. she's young, and doesn't really know what's she's asking for.

"for choosing my biological child over my foster son?. my husband and i never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. we've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. he's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

the child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. we were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that i was pregnant. it was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and i am now over 40. i had thought i had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. we can't financially have both children. i can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who i am already bonding with. my husband wouldn't think of it either. we have to refuse the adoption. 

unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. am i the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

edit: 

baby:
baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

finances:

we currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. we are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. social services is giving us until january to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. we can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

we don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. it's a catch 22 basically.",3

\-i don't want to force him to eat things he hates, i do want to promote his individuality. i feel like i have no other choice but to be strict because if i'm not he'd have me serving him an unhealthy diet.

\-i don't want him to grow up thinking he's entitled to order me or anyone else to cook special meals for him.

\-i do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.

\-i would never let him not eat for a long time like some of you have described. or try to serve him uneaten food for days on end like mommie dearest. i'd cave at that point.",3
"for grounding my daughter the way i did?. so my 15-year-old daughter wanted to go hang out at a friend's place (call friend hannah) and go to the mall and then stay at the hannahs place overnight, i knew the girl and the girl's mum so i agreed. 
she packs her bag and gives me a hug and leaves. 

at around 10 i decided to text hannah's mum to ask how it's going and she gets super confused at my question, i said you have my daughter right? she goes no, hannah is with her dad this weekend i have no teens with me atm. 

so she calls hannah's dad to sort the situation out and he tells her that he is still at work and hannah should be home alone. 

i walk over to hannah's mums house and we drive up to hannah's dads. 

turns out hannah and my daughter wanted to get drunk and throw a house party with older guys, i was seeing red at this point and grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out.

 when we got home i made her hand over her phone and laptop which she has lost the privilege of having for 2 weeks (exluding school work) and she is banned from going to the shops with friends for 2 months. 

my family/ some friends are saying that's a tad harsh and now i'm worried i made the punishment to long.

"for keeping my grandmothers ring when it was given to me by ""mistake""?. my grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what i'd like. instead of jewelry i asked for her wedding dress. no one else wanted it, i had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. after talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. 

when she did pass away i was surprised she hadn't written down who got what pieces. since i had already passed on inheritance of a piece i didn't go to the meeting with the rest of the family. basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. from what i heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

since i wasn't there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. it was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. it was sweet of them to do that, so i could have a piece of her everyday too. 

when i got the ring i didn't examine it. it was big enough i thought it was fake too. but then i saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating leo diamonds). i took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. it's value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). essentially i got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. but they chose it for me. 

now, they want to redo the distribution. but i feel like it's fair. i didn't ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. if i refuse?

edit to add info:
i didn't tell anyone. the jeweler mentioned it to my aunt and it got around to the rest of the family.",3
"for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke?. i live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

my husband and i are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. about a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. super bright, very loud, apparently very fragile and pretty much right out in the open. when i saw her touching it i told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. now, i'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but i felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

a so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding i pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). i'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people i know think i'm in the wrong here. i personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. i also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, i think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them. whose the asshole here?",3
"for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?. married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  in our second year of marriage my wife went home when i was deployed and slept with some dickhead (who i'll refer to as sd from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  she hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  sd and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200b;

the reason i didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after i got home.  and she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  no she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though i agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200b;

she immediately cut off all contact with sd and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that i was right to keep her.

&#x200b;

well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from sd's mother that sd died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200b;

my wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like i got kicked right in the dick.  i instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. all those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  the pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200b;

i asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  she keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200b;

i can't stop repeating that i'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and i'm re-living all those shitty nights i was sure our family would be shattered and i would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

&#x200b;

after some back and forth i put my fucking foot down and told her no, she cannot go.  i said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  aita?

&#x200b;

edit: seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that i was right to keep her."" as if i'm saying i own her and she's a piece of property to me.  that is not the case, i am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.

edit 2: i apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as sd, because that's what he was.  fuck 'im.

a lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean i have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point i can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  we're going to counseling starting tomorrow",3
"for saying i wont pay for my daughters education if she switches her major?. as i said in my title, last night i sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major i will cease her tuition payments.

my daughter is currently a freshman in college. she has just started her first semester and i'm the one paying the bill. i have been saving for over 10 years to do this and i am happy to do it, as long as i feel she is actually setting herself up for success. during high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. she took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. i supported her through all this because i thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

this last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. my daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. i was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. she is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. now i know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but i was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. when i tried to get why she was switching all i got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in la. apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

i tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""how do you plan to get a job"", etc. and she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. this angered me. i'm the one paying for this i feel i have a right to know and not be blown off like that. i thought over it all day and so last night i sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. i am the one paying for her education and i won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. i told her if she doesn't want to do cs that's fine. but she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys and can get her a career. and if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. she can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

this did not sit well with her. we fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. my ex called me up after and told me that i'm no better than a dictator right now and that i'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what i want.

&#x200b;

all i want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. here?

edit:

wow, did not expect this.

i have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. before i say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because i see the same question sent to me and i don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

i do not have a problem with my daughter getting a la degree.

if my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, i would support her 100%. i don't care what my daughter does with her life. i just want her to do something with her life. i am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. the least i feel i can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. i get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. and many of you have told me that i should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. for those two last points, i feel you are wrong.

this money that i have saved is not a ""gift"". this is what i have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. this is my investment in her. for people who claim that i should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, i respectfully disagree. giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing i could do for her right now. supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. and the fact that she seems to think that i am owed no explanation and that i should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment i am making in her.

i am not arguing whether or not i am wrong. if you all feel i am an asshole for this, then i will accept that.

&#x200b;

i called my daughter and left a message saying that i wish to talk with her about this and that i feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. if my daughter wants to go into la, then that is her choice. weather or not i pay for it will be mine.",3
"for making my little sister walk home.. so recently i got my license and my dad thought it would be a good idea for me to drive my little sister home. she would normally walk speaking she falls right under the 1.5 mile rule our school system implemented. the first few days went fine but then she unplugged my phone from the aux cord and started blasting her music. i took notice by not moving and giving her a funny look. she replied with a snarky what and i asked her why she unplugged my phone. she responds with ""i got tired of listening to your music"". i told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. i then unplugged her phone and started driving. then she gets bold and while i'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. so i pullover and tell her to get out. she kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. i wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when i got home. she was pissed and ""threatened"" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. she went on to call me an ego maniac and other names. when my dad got home it started a argument between them because he thinks i was justified. from my pov she's a 7th grader that should understand that her actions have consequences. i understand it is a little thing but i gave her a warning and she didn't respect it.

"for kicking my husband out of the house because he lied to me about money. my husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole ""i don't have money for gas"" victim part. this money is not part of our savings or anything. anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. during those two weeks i bought groceries for us, i paid for our take out food, i offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall i was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. he saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. he let me pay for his car insurance. he heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

yesterday i asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and i didn't have cash. he got really nervous when i asked him if i could borrow his debit card. he started to act strange. i asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. i asked him if he was hiding money from me? and he denied it and said i was paranoid and crazy.

he checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. he literally shouted, ""wow wow wow i have extra money!!!! oh my god this is so awesome!!"" and he played the whole i didn't know part.

he continued to argue and i told him that i don't care about the money i care about honesty. why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

it took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly i was going to ask for some money if i knew. he said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

today i asked him to leave the house. i called him cruel and deceitful. i told him that i don't want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

by the way i'm 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. we've know each other for 3 years.

am i the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
i'm just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. and now i'm questioning everything in our relationship. maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. i don't know anything anymore.

i followed the advice i received here (thank you). he's back home but staying in the guest room. he came back with a brand new baby car seat (guilt?) and he's apologizing profusely. we'll be taking marriage counseling.",3
"aita: i ditched a girl 40 minutes from her house on our first date. i know the title already sounds like i'm a major asshole, but there is a few more variables that need to be discussed before you make your decision. 

also, this is a throwaway acct for obvious reasons

so i meet a girl on tinder named ""kim"" and we exchange a few messages before deciding to meet up for coffee.

the date is going ok, although it was a bit boring, we grabbed our cup of starbucks (i paid) we chatted for a bit and decided to drive to a cool little outdoor park to go for a walk. 

we drive around 30 mins to this park, listened to a bit of music on the way, still getting to know each other a bit and everything was going fine. 

i parked, we got out of the car and walked a bit, still chatting, nothing deep, but the usual what you do for work, hobbies etc etc.

i had to take a leak, so i go to the bathroom and when i walked out, i noticed she was talking to a guy and he was being very flirty and when i walked up to them, he asked who i was and she responded: ""oh he's just my friend hahaha"" and he said he wanted to grab her number to go out for a drink sometime. she was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. 

at this point i was just over it. i wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me i have no future with her.

i decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. i didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it. 

oh well, i honestly feel like a bit of an asshole, but also feel it was just in a sense considering what happened....",3
"for refusing to support my wife through her diagnosis after her infidelity. my wife and i had a pretty normal marriage. no kids, both employed and really happy together. for 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

she recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. the first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. dinner went well, came home and went to bed. wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after i had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

we talked, yelled, cried. i spent most of the night sick. told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. i've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. turns out we were wrong, as i was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. i got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. she was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. i told her i wished her all the best, i'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while i'd help financially from a distance, i wasn't physically going back.

they (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. my own friends are split 50/50. i don't want to go back. before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. we had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. we were solid. she just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. she never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. while i certainly don't think anyone deserves this and i am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. i feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing i won't forgive her when it's over. it feels like prolonging the inevitable, and i feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. she has family and friends so she isn't alone. i care about the woman i thought i married, but i no longer love who she turned out to be, so i feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. i'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. aita?

**edit**: to the reddit detectives further down. when i said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. we talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. secondly, i mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when i was told i didn't believe it, i figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment i left. i also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. as far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. and i figured this would be easy to figure out but i guess not, i knew her friend forced her to tell me because i demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. finally, i know a lot of people post made up stories. i'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details i can't prove it. if i wanted karma i wouldn't be on a throwaway, i posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable i think it's time for neutral third party judgement and i was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. to the mods, i'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. i'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.",3
"for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?. alright.

i'm a european woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to san francisco for a fancy-pants internship. it was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- i'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time i've ever been out at work.

there is one co-worker who we shall call linda. she's a trans woman (mtf).

linda's position means that me and she and i don't really interact at work often. therefore, i was told about her before i met her. one of my co-workers told me that she existed, i was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. i met linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, i thought that was the end of it.

now, linda does not pass as a cis woman.  she's still a woman and i'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

this now caused an issue. a few of us had a halloween get-together and invited linda. at some point, she and i were alone at our table. we got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative european country. at some point, i made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

her face just fell. she started hissing at me about how dare i presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (i did not misgender her, at no point did i use 'he' or anything like that- i just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. drunk idiot i was, i blurted out 'but...we all know?' which we do.

i was extremely confused. apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. this somehow led linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

linda now, and i say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. she confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare i judge her. i, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. she is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

for saying what i said?",3
"for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?. living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. i have a second grader who i have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

she came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. i thought for a minute that maybe i accidentally grabbed one of my quest bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

for her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. my daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, i put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. the teacher commented on it.

lunchtime came around, and i guess a similar thing happened. my kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week i made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and i guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. this is what sparked the note. 

so i explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured i'd skip the pickles next time. well, it wasn't good enough. just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a pb & j, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

i called the teacher and asked her about the note. teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. i asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""no"" and ""this really shouldn't be a big deal.""

this might be where i fucked up. i told the teacher that i'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. that when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, i will continue to send my kid to school with the foods i pick. teacher got huffy and hung up. 

just to double check, i asked my daughter two things: does she like her lunches? (enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""are the other kids making fun of you?"" because i know that can be an issue. she said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. 

so aita, or is this teacher way out of line?",3
"for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?. i am 24m and i have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. she is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. i have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. lately i feel like i've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

last week i won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. she also happens to like this singer so i asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. i said i can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. she said she'd love to go, but only as friends. she says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. she told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. i said i'll think about it. i was quite hurt because honestly i don't have much experience with rejection, and i was annoyed that she turned me down. 

today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. she immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. still, i'm taking her out for drinks on friday. but just now, the friend who i asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. i told her honestly that i already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

when i told my sister about what happened, she said i'm being really douchy. she says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and i should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. i said she can't understand because she's not a dude. because let's me honest, if i had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously i'm taking the second one. for just being honest about what i want?

**edit**: because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: yes i would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. nowhere do i even say that we have to share a bed...

but the part where she says she's not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. she likely said she'll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. so why would i make the experience awkward for the both of us when i could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **edit over**",3
"for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?. my son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. he is only 17 and she is 16. i told him i was proud that he came forward to tell me, but i didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. according to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". we tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

since then, the house has been quite tense. any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. i have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. since my son told us they were pregnant, i have done the following:

1. i wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. i open the door, scream as loud as i can until i know he is awake, and i shut the door. i've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. i purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. i have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, i shut off the internet until he changes it. i will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. while playing one of his games, i told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. i placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. while he was doing this, i went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. i told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. i have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. when he presses me for a reason, i tell him ""you dont have a babysitter. you can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" he has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. yesterday, i did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. i told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. this was the last straw for him.

after his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. he told me i am being completely unrealistic. i reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything i have done so far he has done to me in the past.

his mother tells me i am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but i don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. if anything, i want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

tell me the truth; am i being too much of an asshole here?",3
"for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my gf wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?. to preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

i occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition i've had since i was born. over the last year or so my gf(r) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

for the issue at hand. r is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

edit: to answer some faqs, she doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, dr death, ymh, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. i love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when i'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

i've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for that long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. i never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how i felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and i feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. i'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",3
"for sending an explicit video my ex sent to me to hurt me to her family. hi aita. i am going to try to make this as brief as possible so i don't ramble.

&#x200b;

i dated em for a year and a half. during this time i confided in her some personal secrets, which i don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that i am very sensitive towards.

&#x200b;

we did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. i broke up with her because i found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. recently i found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. she basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information i shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200b;

i sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. she replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. that was the last straw for me, and i sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what em sends me when i ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200b;

her familly is quite religious and they lost it. apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. aita?

&#x200b;

tl:dr my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. i sent them to her family. aita?

&#x200b;

edit: well this blew up. i'll try and answer some of the things i have seen asked most often here:

&#x200b;

1: i feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that i have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. to put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, i was a victim of csa for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. it led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that i struggle with to this day (i never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that i've done that i'd like to not have spread around). she has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200b;

2: by all of her friends and family, i meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. i worded that terribly. i have not been in the best headspace as of late. sorry.

&#x200b;

3: we have not spoken since. i have no desire to speak to her ever again. my coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and i have not heard anything from him. as petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all i care. i have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. maybe i am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. i feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200b;

4: i will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. i have the money to fight a legal case if i have to, though obviously, i would rather not.

&#x200b;

yeah. that pretty much the main things i wanted to clear up. i'll go through the thread tomorrow if i feel up to it and see if there's anything else. it's a bit of a shitshow and i'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",3
"if i didn't give up my honey moon villa to my grandparents?. my family is asian, my husbands side is white.

my husband and i got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our ""real"" one. 
we were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. my husband and i took the villa.

the bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. we made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

we have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. during dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. my grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to ""slave"" and live as ""peasants"" while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

this is bora bora we're talking about. no one is living as a peasant here. 

there was only 1 villa available in our section. had i given it to my grandparents i think it would've been offensive to my husbands grandparents. if there was 3, we would've given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. but unfortunately, there wasn't. i mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

i obviously objected, and said i felt as though my husband and i should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate our marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? wouldn't one just sit back and be grateful they're on a free vacation instead of complaining?

my grandparents freaked out. saying i'm holding money above their head and that i'm being disrespectful and not following their orders. they stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

idk what to do. my side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and i agree. they are so ridiculous. all i wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it's falling apart. 

i don't think i'm the asshole at all, but i've been up all night thinking wether i should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. but another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

so reddit, what do i do? if i denied giving up my villa?



***update***
even though i really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, i decided it'd be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that i was disrespectful.

during breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if i was there. everyone tried calling them-nope we're not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. after a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

i made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. they said they hadn't looked yet and that should be my job if i was kicking them out?? i made sure they knew i was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

they kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

well, i'm not doing that. 
i'll pay for their flight back home, but i've already done enough accommodating on my honeymoon vacation. 

so there you have it. my grandparents weren't even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. i called their bluff. 

after breakfast, i found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. they also didn't get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. my cousins came over and honestly couldn't care less my grandparents are gone, in their words ""they kill the vibe"". so everyone's happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

i'm happy i was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

i have an overflow of messages and comments, that i can't get back to. however, the main question is what my profession is. 

i did not go the usual asian route. i actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. my dad is also an entrepreneur, i looked up to him and am so glad i had him as an inspiration who paved the way. don't give up on your dreams, you guys.",3
"for refusing to meet my wife's ex-boyfriend?. my wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. all they do is text each other occasionally, which i have no problem with. i explained to her early on that i am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. she agreed and it was never an issue until now.

her ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and i to meet. once again i explained to her that i have zero interest in such a meeting. i see no point to it, i don't need his blessing or approval, and i have enough friends. plus the whole idea just seems awkward. 

she explained that it would mean a lot to her if i would just meet with him. i asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. i snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *""since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?""* 

she didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. i know my answer is not going to change and i am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. aita? also any advice is much appreciated.

thank you.

**p.s**

i don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but i think i'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. i love my wife but i don't think i have her heart. he was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.

**edit**

with regards to divorcing her over this:

> i'd rather divorce her than control her. i didn't tell her that i would do this, it will simply happen. i can control what i do (not meeting him), but i cannot control what she does. it would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp.",3
"if i talk to my 18 yo brother about age of consent against my mothers wishes?. my brother is 18. he has a 15 year old girlfriend. age of consent where he lives is 16. they are both in highschool, he is a senior, she is a junior.

to my knowledge, he is still a virgin. he does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and std prevention. another thing my mother and i butt heads about but she gave in on that one.

my mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. she said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. it wasn't necessary. i implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.

last night i called my brother and discussed it with him myself. i didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. he also told me they haven't done anything yet. i told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. i told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  i also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that i wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.

i tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. my mother is pissed that i talked to him about it when she told me no.

edit: if it matters, i'm his sister and i am 26. i live out of state. 

edit: he lives in ct since a bunch of people have asked. i mentioned in a few comments, but now it's here too.

"update: if i cancelled our wedding?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cuvkw3/wibta_if_i_cancelled_our_wedding/

tldr at the bottom! 

hello, all! it's been some time since i laid out all the bullshit my fiance and i were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. we were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. now, on to what happened! 

my fiance and i talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. we both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. we decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. we were both ecstatic, but, also extremely worried at how our parents were going to take it. especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. but, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and i would then tell mine. 

surprisingly, his parents were so supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. they were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! they also handled telling their families and friends in texas that we were eloping and to get over it. so, that saved us the trouble! his other family was very supportive and wished us the best. my father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. my mother on the hand, was furious.

the phone call to her started off calmly enough and i did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. but, i pressed forward. i told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, i laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. i knew immediately that i was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. i was pissed because i had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. i responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. well, shit hit the fan.

she sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how i never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. i remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. so, i told her not to come. i was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

for days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. i responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that i wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. i offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

my fiance and i have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

tldr: we are eloping, bitches!

edit; since everyone here has become a dictionary for the word ""elopement"", take it however you like. small wedding/elopement, i don't care. i'm marrying the love of my life in the way i want, so, i won either way 👍",3
"for buying the dress that my friend wanted but couldn't get because they don't have it in plus size?. i and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend's wedding, and for the past few weeks we've been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. my friend ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said ""i love this but they don't have it in my size."" (she is us 14.)

i agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group's conversation moved along. 

yesterday ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. i really liked the green bateau dress so i checked if they had it in my size (i am us 8) and they did so i told our group that i was going to order the bateau dress. no one replied immediately, but i didn't think too much about it because it's not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. i ordered the dress.

a few hours later i got a call from one of my friends saying that ana called her and was upset that i ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn't buy it because it wasn't available in her size. my friend said ana thinks i'm trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that i can wear the dress she likes because i'm skinnier. 

to be honest i have mixed emotions about what ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so i tried calling ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that i didn't intend for her to feel that way. but she hasn't answered my calls or messages. 

so i just want to know: for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress ana liked but couldn't buy because they didn't have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",3

"for telling my mother-in-law that she can't control how i act in my home?. my mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. it's been ok. she and i are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. she is a traditional hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. i am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" i used to watch what i said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. but when my spouse asked if she could live with us, i said i was okay with it as long as i no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. my spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. i don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

last week, my 10-year-old and i were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. we were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. we are very mature, i know. but when i said, ""i fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in spanish, ""don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. i will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" and i said, in english (i can understand spanish but can't speak it well), ""this is my home. you don't get a say in how i interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" she stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

my spouse says ita because i embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because i expected her to accept too much, too quickly. they also say that i am being a little culturally insensitive and that i need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how i spoke to her, so i need to apologize. but i think it was important for her to see that i will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that i won't be policed in my own home.",3
"for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment?. i have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only i can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. all the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but i told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

things worked pretty well at first but over time i caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. after the third or so time i sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. they all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and i told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

i came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

"aitah for letting my coworkers quit because i got fired?. a regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar i worked at for over 10 years, i worked there for 4 years. i made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought i was taking one. i just want to make extra money.

my manager happened to see this on the cameras. there is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it's a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

there is no way to prove there wasn't booze in my shot, i saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove i didn't put liquor in that shot.

i honestly don't and didn't care enough to argue with her about it. i'm about to start a new job since i graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

i trained basically every new person at this bar, and i was honest with them that i was fired in our work group chat. they all started saying if you got fired for that we don't want to work here either. they were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

i told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. i said i'm going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink anything out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. i also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

i then let my anger overtake me and i said ""if you want to find a job where you don't have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. you're all capable people that don't deserve a psycho watching over you when you've put good time into a work place."" i basically contradicted myself. 

i feel like i went over the top, my sister said i should've kept my mouth shut. but i explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the ""mix things together to look like booze so people don't feel rejected when they buy you shots trick"". she thinks it's crazy the new manager won't trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

my old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiance, but she told the new manager that i was trustworthy and i thought the new manager would have some trust considering i was basically running the bar when she came in. 

whatever the case, aitah for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? because as of now 7/10 bartenders where i was fired from are planning a group quit. i don't want the bar to close, but i want my manager to realize that she messed up...",3

i do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father's wife, i begrudgingly show respect. i have never called her out of her name until later in this story. if she speaks to me, i will say something back. if i am in her home, i will clean up after myself. however, i will always refer to her as my father's wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. this is something she cannot accept.

i have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. while at my father' house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying ""the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,"" and said that i was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why i would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. i guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

she then revealed that when my dad gets back from his tdy (temporary duty assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say ""don't mess with her,"" with her 2-month-old daughter. i have never been in any of the previous family portraits because i refused to and my dad said i didn't have to.

i told her i was not going to participate

she asked why i was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

six years' worth of hurt came out. i told her she was a fool to ever think i was her child or that i considered her family. from my perspective, she was nothing, but my father's racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. i took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn't my father's child because she looks nothing like him.

she turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful i was and i had no right to talk to her in such a manner. i fully admit i called her a bitch and stated she didn't even deserve any respect from me because she didn't respect my mother's marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. after realizing what i had said, i left and haven't talked to her since.

everyone that i have talked to say i should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and i don't mind doing that.  however, certain people say i shouldn't have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

so who is the asshole?",3
"for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request). **edit:** well fuck me i just spoke with my maid. she says she hasn't seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she's never seen before. from her description i've never heard of him either. she kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. 

i guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. so before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. honestly thought my marriage was perfect i never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

my wife and i have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. my wife is a stay at home mom while i work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

we live in hong kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. our maid is a 34 year old filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. she lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

the problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. she hasn't given any specific reason other than ""i don't want a maid anymore."" i honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but i don't want to fire her because:

- she has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- she relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- we still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- i work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. my wife doesn't cook nor clean so i am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

the woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and i don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

i'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

"for telling my wife to get out of bed and feed the damn cat.. alright everyone, i need some judgement on this one...

my wife and i have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. this only happens on weekends.

monday-friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. however on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. he will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.

here's where the story takes a twist. awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. when we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. i thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.

my wife disagreed. her reasons range from:

concerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.

concerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.

concerned the cat won't ""love"" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.

concerned it's a waste of batteries.

i've told my wife i understand all of her concerns but i still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. she still disagrees.

so i did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ultimatum! 

i told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, i'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.

so reddit, aita?

edit: i'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.

edit 2: many people have been demanding i pay the ""cat tax"" and post a picture of the real ah in question. sadly i am a reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. if anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, i will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.

edit 3: hopefully this works...

"for having an almanac?. a bit of backstory. i met my wife in the summer of 2008. she was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. i had gone to pick up some boxes because i was moving. out walked my sara...it was close to the end of her shift. and working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (seriously, i don't care what ddd says, that place is gross.) she was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...i'm pretty sure i fell in love right then and there that wonderful may night. (inb4 ""thats so old fashioned!!!"" don't care. when you know, you know.) i wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
it started after our first date. she had mentioned she loves lilacs. me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know jack or shit about flowers. but the way she talked about how much she loved them i knew i didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. so i wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (think what cops use to take notes.) this was the almanacs genesis. over the years i've written down information about my wife. her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. basically all the little things i knew i would forget. anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. i would go through it every once in a while so i could do something sweet for her. fast forward to yesterday morning.
i get a call from her around 11am. ""what the fuck is the almanac?"" (the almanac is written on the cover. it's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) she obviously has it, and i don't lie to my wife, so i tell her. she gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""i always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. i get home from work last night and she's really dejected. i asked her what's wrong and she says the almanac has cheapened every sweet thing i've ever done for her. she called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. mind you i've never showed it to a single soul nor have i even told anyone about it. until yesterday i was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (she also said she hasn't decided if i can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) i'm kind of heart broken. i feel like this should be an example of how much i love her. i'm terrified she's going to burn it. i want to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. that's why i write them down. i don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. i do it because i love my wife. i hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and i don't want to be that guy. so yeah, i took notes. and now i'm getting the silent treatment. or at best single word answers.

"for asking boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip he's taking without me?. sadly this is a serious question.

in an exclusive (not open) relationship for 8 months. bf 30s is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me also 30s over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. he wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. 

i saw the condoms in his clear ziploc bag (note: plainly visible, i did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course i asked about them. his response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.

reddit, i watched him combine otc meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. i don't think anything in his bag is in there by ""accident."" but now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like i ruined new year's for asking this. 

for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?

edit: he has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. i don't believe he has an active plan to cheat. i am, however, upset, because to me the act of bringing condoms is an active refusal to close the door on the possibility of intimacy with someone else if the opportunity happens to arise.",3
"for telling my friend i didn't appreciate paying for a $200 meal at her husband's birthday party?. my friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. the party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. we've been working on some remodeling projects, so we've been on a strict budget. my husband and i wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.

when we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. when we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. i asked a passing waiter if i could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. the waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.

my friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but i was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.

as the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend's husband with the check. my friend's husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, ""i know this isn't how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. we told you that."" i suddenly started panicking inside. i was trying to catch someone else's eye to see if they were panicking as much as i was. one other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. i opened the check, and the total was $211. i thought i was going to throw up. i have never spent that much on a meal.

i held my shit together because i didn't want to make a scene. the couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn't paying. they said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.

i ended up messaging her and said, ""thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*'s party. we had a great time. just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. we are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. thanks again.""

my friend said, ""sorry! should have given you a heads up. glad you came."" and we haven't spoken or hung out since. i've tried to set up coffee dates and girl's nights but she just bails or never responds. it's been almost 3 months, and she doesn't seem to want to talk to me at all.",3
"for calling a pregnant woman a c***?. i was at the bookstore the other day and as i approached the cash i saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

as i got closer i listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. she was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn't available at the store. she was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn't available. the girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and i could tell she felt bad. when the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a ""inconsiderate little bitch"". as the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said ""what's the point of customer service if they won't help you?"" 
at this point, i had felt horrible for the young girl and i knew i had to say something. so i looked at the woman and i said ""i just hope whatever you give birth to isn't a total c*** like his mom"". the woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. i said i didn't care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. she cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. he came in, didn't say much (i'm 6'2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. as she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

now, i still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that i was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. i felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. the cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. she thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so i think she's ok. 

ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

i still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying i was wrong in using the c word?

edit: a few people have mentioned that i should not have included the hijab comment. it was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, i meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn't even have the chance to get a kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. sorry if it came across as pandering. was not my intention.

"for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an april fools joke?. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


am i the asshole?

"for showering my niece?. obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. also a heads up i personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that i feel like i'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what i actually did wrong. 

so last weekend i  25m was watching my niece 3f. i have a daughter 5f myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. on this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. what was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. seriously i went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when i came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. i immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. i helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while i washed hers. 

i thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly i didn't even think twice about doing it. my sil does not agree. she keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that i should've called her to okay it first. that mindset is kinda confusing to me. like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who i always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of atlantis. plus, what was i supposed to do? let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? however, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when i'm a man and not her dad. are they right and i'm missing the point or am i right that there's nothing weird about it?

eta: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so i'll address them. 

1. my daughter's mother is dead and i'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. idk if my sil was abused. will throw out there though that i was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and i as kids.

3. i was *not* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think i was. i never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

"for skipping my child's birth to see my dying father?. i had to make the hardest decision of my life a week ago and i want some judgment to see if i made the right decision so please don't remove and say it needs to go tinto another subreddit cuz i'll post there too

&#x200b;

my wife went into labor a few weeks earlier then expected and she ended up giving birth at the hospital. the day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). i decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. my wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child. obviously i didn't want this shit to happen but i felt seeing my father for the last time was important especially since i hadn't seen him in weeks and we weren't on good terms then which we eventually resolved thankfully. if you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but i'm mainly here for judgment

"for hiding my personal life at work?. i'm in a little trouble at work because i've been sort of hiding my personal life. i've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. i'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. with that, i never, ever talk about home life. i'm not ashamed of my life i just don't like to discuss it at work. my coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. if i'm asked any questions i usually redirect or move on to someone else. in this manner, none of my coworkers knew i'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

we hired melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. she spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. however, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. try as she did, i never gave her anything. my coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. compartmentalization aside, i've made some great friendships at work. there are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. they are a big part of my life but i'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. they're hugely important and come before everything else but i'm not a sycophant and i enjoy the ten hours a day i'm at work when i get to be an adult and talk about things other than jojo siwa and the newest jenndashian exploit.

last week, friday, melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. at lunch she announced to everyone that i am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. i play softball, i kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that i'm on facebook. she couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. i use a shortened version of my name (ali from alexandra) and my married name on fb so i'm not sure how she found me, unless she used whitepages and put two and two together. i've already reported her to hr.

but the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a bfd. one of my friends said she's hurt that i don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". i tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, i just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. i never bring work home. when i'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. heck, i chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when i'm not there. i've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. i honestly don't see the problem. i've never lied to them, i've never given them false info, i've never made up wild tales about my life. i'm still the same person i was, now they just know more about me than they did.

eta: i know this has been posted three times today. i didn't know reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and i thought it was the account i was posting from so i created a second throwaway and then a third because i never got confirmation the post was uploaded. i couldn't even get past the white screen with the little reddit face spinning in the center. those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. this one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

eta:  i don't have any sort of interesting update. hr brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us wtf is going on. i presented my side, as detailed above, melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. i asked my hr rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. there were several. then i asked him to search my married name, or the one i go by on fb, ""ali smith"". there were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. in any case, too many to count. i haven't touched my own page since i reported the incident. it was about thirty names from the top but like i said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. i do have an instagram page that's on private but i only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. she found me night before last and friended me. naturally i blocked her. hr gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. my rep wasn't sure why melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called bs on her for claiming it was innocent. so that's that. that's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. however, i took the advice from this sub and i'm making amends. they're all most receptive. i'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. but they know enough about me to know i'm not an automaton or anything.",3
"if i don't donate all or even part of my inheritance (about $725,000)? my cousin say's it's ""blood money"" and claims she's donating 100% of her share.. using a throwaway since money is involved here. lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. 

i was born in south africa but emigrated when i was just a few months old so i am totally american. i come from a family of full on apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for america. my parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. they made a small fortune in south africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. to be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the us, but still the money because they were white and well connected in south africa. 

my grandmother died recently. she lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in socal so i figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe i'd get some family heirlooms. my head about popped off when i saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). money that will literally change my life. 

my parents business failed so i wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. she's also now married, lives in rancho santa fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. she claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in south africa. she is seriously chiding me that *if* i plan on keeping it, then i am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. 

i have student loans i could pay off, i could actually have a down payment on a house, i could invest, i mean...i know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. i understand where it came from but i also can't possibly imagine giving it away. i have no idea what charities are like in south africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and i'm better off just keeping it.

"for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?. my (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. she made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. the jokes all seemed lighthearted and i just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. fast forward to our 20 week scan. we go in super excited and nervous. i don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. 

we go in and find out we are having a boy. my wife immediately bursts into tears and i hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. she doesn't stop crying the whole day. i let her calm down and try to comfort her. 

it's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. she refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. 

now that it's been nearly a month i'm starting to get a bit frustrated. it's just such an overreaction. i told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. she cried and called me an asshole. i told her she needs to get a grip. i felt awful but i feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous.

she's made it no secret she hates me. i remember when she was 13 or 14, i paid for us to go to disney land as a family vacation (cliche, i know). she refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. i was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, i went along with it and stayed home.

stuff like that is the norm. she'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. she'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. it's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. but it's ruined the marriage, because i've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. anything i do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

anyway, my wife and i separated over this. it's just too much for me to bare. but i'm not mad at my wife, i'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

i decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. i didn't do this to spite her, because frankly i'm ready to move on with my life. i did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. i did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. say it's going to emotionally scar her. but quite frankly, i think she needed to be told.

"for not paying for the meal?. on a road trip last week, my girlfriend and i stopped at a rural diner for brunch. we sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). it was a very nice meal honestly. our total was around $25. i was ready to pay with my debit card.

the waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. unfortunately i had zero cash on me. ""how were we supposed to know?"" i asked. she shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. there was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

she sighs and points to an atm on the other side of the dining room. at this point i'm still apologetic so i went there with my card. i noticed it had a fee of, i shit you not, $9. i asked to speak to the manager. she brought the owner.

i told the owner this is ridiculous. i suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that atm. nope. he threatened to call the police. i said go ahead. my girlfriend felt the same way. long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

i told my sister about this today. she thinks the cops were wrong and i was being an asshole. because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" i think the owner is the asshole. the only part i regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

"for telling somebody to clean up my trash and leaving the restaurant?. i was at chipotle for lunch today and i was sitting at a 2 person table by myself. i finished eating and went to get a refill, and 2 girls were sitting at my table. i told them that i was still sitting there since i still had 20 mins of lunch left. they pretty much ignored me and said ""there's no more open seats"". so i said fuck it and started to walk away when they said ""are you gonna throw away your trash?"" which i replied ""it's not my table"" and left. aita?",3
"for refusing to pay alimony to my cheating ex-wife. i met my wife in my early 30s. she was in her mid 20s at the time. i was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. she on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

so when i meet her we click instantly and i fall head over heels for her. we get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. when we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. obviously i was jealous but i went along with it since it seemed logical.

so she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while i work 12 hour days and then some. i'm not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

a couple years ago i discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend's husband. divorced obviously followed.

the only major asset we had in the us was our house, which was a premarital asset. we had a shared bank account, but since i am a finance guy i handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, i'd have no problem paying what's fair. but the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

so in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

so here i am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. so i sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it's taking so long to liquidate our savings. once abroad i immediately stop alimony payments.

now she has no legal recourse (i've double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

the reason i'm asking here is that my own children are split on this. my son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. i figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",3
"for ditching my date and causing a scene?. i'm 19f and my date was 25m, i was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while i was half way through my session. 

i get an ig message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would've found me since my page is super private, my username isn't specific at all to my real name and i have 40 followers. 
he explains he's so and so's friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it's hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so i'm excited and we plan to meet up. 

we catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, i take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. i smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. we're in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

i study justice so he's telling me how he's an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that's when i freak. he makes a comment about how high i am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point i start to get really scared.
he keeps asking if anyone knows i'm with him, who i live with, how much money i make & how much i have on me etc. just weird questions. i was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction imo was much more extreme. i was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. my perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say i was genuinely scared.

i hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so i could be around people and also so he wasn't dui, he didn't want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that i felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

i get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he's taking a phone call. i go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene ""i'm really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me"" they catch on and can see i'm upset. i sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he'll take me home but they are very firm. he addresses me quite angrily and asks ""who does your mum think your with?"" the owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

i felt guilty since i had gotten along with him and he'd taken the time to see me, i'm not 100% sure if i was in danger and if i could've stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. i tried to have tact in the situation and didn't have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would've been better to tell him i was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

edit: some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, i'm super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? correct me if i'm wrong please. i genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there's something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way i did and if i'm the ahole for handling a bad date this way. i see that this isn't as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here irl i had very mixed and negative reactions. hence why i got on here and despite all that, i do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying i did the right thing even though it didn't necessarily feel like that in the moment.",3
"for not wanting to share my son?. my son died at age 4. on the first mothers day after he died my husband got me a necklace with some of his ashes in. i wear it every single day.

my aunt is not someone i see often. she got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. she came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. when we were told he didn't have long left i asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. i figured she was in denial, maybe. i certainly was. she then missed his funeral to go to a concert.

her husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. i said no because i want him to stay with us. all of him. then my aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said i was being selfish, he was her family too. 

i still said no. she said she acted the way she did when he died because she was struggling with it, and was in denial. but so was i. but it's been 3 years and she's hardly come to see any of us. she's not even met our newest baby yet who is 4 months old.

"for leaving/ghosting my gf that was financially dependent on me without warning after discovering she cheated on me. **update:** 

i was not expecting to post an update so soon, but i was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.

over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. however i had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. however of course they know that i can't avoid work. so they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as i get home from work. with them is my girlfriend. they insist i talk to my girlfriend and i eventually relent and our parents leave.

once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.

...and then she gives the most ridiculous excuse i've ever heard. she says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. this emotional support quickly turned physical

this makes no sense. we have always talked about having kids excitedly.

she takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. she also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if i don't believe her. so she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. she says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. i ask to see her phone. she reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since i threw her out.

i tell her i need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. once outside i lock the doors, unblock her on whatsapp, and send her a long text. i'm reciting this by memory so i don't have to open whatsapp and see her reply.

>whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. but you should know the following. first, if the child is mine, i will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. we will never get back together. the moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. secondly, i will not interact with you at all until the child is born. don't reach out to me until then, i want nothing to do with you. finally, i will not have any role in the kid's life - nor will i sign any birth certificate - until i get a paternity test. this child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. i will never forgive you for that.

i have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. i also won't post any updates after this. i get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so i'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.

---------------------------------

**original post**

----------------------------------------------------

**with regards to the meta post:** i know i'm not an asshole for leaving her. i'm more concerned with the way i went about it.

-------------------------

my gf and i have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. she quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.

last week i discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-bf from high-school. i needed to use her phone to call mine, and went i unlocked her phone it was open on a whatsapp conversation between them. i have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and i don't understand why she'd want to be with him.

anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. angry that i've put so much into this relationship and woman that i thought would be the mother of my future children. angry that i've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. just angry.

so i arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as i can find, and leave it outside. text her of what i've done, and say if she wants to get anything else i've missed to have her brother come and get it - i don't want to see or speak to her ever again.

anyway, since i did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. they say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if i kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.

what do you guys think? am i the asshole here? should i swallow my pride and approach this differently?

**edit2: the lease is also only in my name and she's never paid a dime of rent in the entire time she's been living here.**",3
"for attacking a muslim's beliefs when she didn't want to sit next to my brother and his friend on the plane?. long time lurker, here is my first post!

so i (f16) was on a flight from dubai to new york, so it was quite a long trip. usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother's friend couldn't afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn't present during this whole situation.

when we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. i was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. i saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

i wasn't paying attention but i took off my headphones when i heard my brother's friend say no to the lady. she then said: ""it is against my religion to touch men in public"" and my brother said,

""but we're not touching you.""

she looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother's friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. i thought she was so entitled, so i told them,

""don't move. just ignore her.""

she then proceeded to ask me if i knew them, so i said yes. she asked to switch with me. so this is what i said,

""no. i don't want the middle seat because i'm very claustrophobic (i'm not, i just prefer the aisle seat so i can stretch my legs)"" and she said, 

""that's not my problem.""

that's when i got really pissed and i said it,

""your religion is not our problem. should've chosen better seats then"" 

then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that's the last we saw of her. i'm guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

when we got back from the trip, my brother's friend told me he was going to move and i wasn't right to attack her religion like that.

"- i moved for my husband's job, my kids now hate me. bit long, stick with me. throwaway because i'm active on a mom board, and haven't discussed this there.

my ex and i split 5 years ago now. we had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. he's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. after my divorce, i reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. he's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. we married 2 years ago. 

a year ago, he got orders to move to texas from where we all were in california. my older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. i approached my ex and told him the situation. i said i know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. he blew his top and said absolutely not, i wouldn't ""take his kids away"" and said he'd see me in court.

the judge ended up ruling in his favor, and i was awarded summers and every other holiday. i was absolutely devastated. i moved, and i've barely seen the kids since. they came at christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. the older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on facetime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. my daughter has said i chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but i can tell he's angry.

"thinking of leaving marriage because step-daughter got herself knocked up.... yeah, i know this sounds awful.

my (32m) wife's (35f) daughter (16f) recently announced she is pregnant. 

she claims she doesn't know who the father is. i suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. i mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? it can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.

anyway, moving on. she is adamant on keeping the baby. abortion is out of the question apparently. wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. they're both ecstatic.

the problem i have with this is:

1. my wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. she's still in school and fully intends to go to college. my wife and i will 100% end up looking after it.

2. i am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. my wife works part time and makes very little money. i don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.

3. i wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. she's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. i feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.

i raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""this isn't up to you. this is her decision to make. we will support her.""

i agree it's her decision, but why do i have to support her?

as it stands now, i'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. i'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am i prepared to pay to raise it.

i fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.

"for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight?. so this month i was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which i had booked and seats selected for. i specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

well, a very obese man boards and i can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. i assume maybe he bought two hence why he's even attempting to board. i'm mentally crossing my fingers he's not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

i get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. i sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. after a minute, i decided to be upfront and tell him:

""sir, i'm sorry but this situation is not working for me, you're taking up quite a bit of my seat"". 

he wasn't rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there's not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. it just wasn't enough, though. he still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. i'm talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

i end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. she instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. she goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren't any open seats on this flight, so there wasn't a way to move people so he could have two. this causes a very awkward silence. 

the guy seemed embarrassed and didn't want to get up. he mentioned how he can't wait for a later flight. i felt bad for him but i was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort i paid for. the flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he'll need to book another flight. the guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here's where i made my offer. 

i told the guy, ""look, i'll put up with this if you give me $150 — that's half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.""

he instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. he even told me he appreciated it. 

well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn't volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. i just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

from my perspective, i gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and i was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person's body pressed against you involuntarily). a win-win. he wasn't angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

after the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but i ignored them. this leads me to beg the question, aita? ",3
"if i tell my wife that i will no longer be helping with her pregnancy cravings or sleep next to her because she lashed out at me for not finding choco chip ice cream at 3am?. this happened a couple of days ago and i was really pissed. i'm here because i want to know if i'm in the wrong here. 

my wife is going to give birth to our twin daughters. i've done everything to support her. i make breakfast everyday and i make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. 

yesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. we had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. i really wanted to get her the ice cream. she told me that she wanted choco chip. i drove for an hour to find a place at that time. but they didn't have any choco chip at that time. i didn't want to disappoint her, so i got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. 

when i got back, i told her that i didn't find choco chip. idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. she threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me i didn't love her. she also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. i slept in another room. 

now today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. but i did not sleep with her at night. i've decided that i don't want to do anything now. this is not the first time this has happened. i'm not a fantastic cook. she insists that i make something for her, but when i make it she always tells me that it's horrible. she later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ). here??",3
"for having professional hair and makeup for a wedding when the bride didn't. hi, y'all.

my brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on sunday. i (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while i was a guest, i wasn't in the bridal party. 

they got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. the dress code on the invitation was ""formal."" for the three weddings i've been to with formal dress codes (and the eight i've been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. that is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. a few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my sil could hire locally. 

well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. when her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn't used a professional either, nor had she. 

it was kind of awkward in pictures, but i didn't really see a big deal.

well, yesterday, i got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to ""upstage her"" and that sort of thing. quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (fyi, my brother thought i looked pretty and didn't see an issue except ""when did you become a woman?"")

"for telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a sahm i am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore?. my wife and i have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. wife hasn't been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and i actually just got a new job. 

at my old job i was working 45-50 hours a week. at my new job my hours fluctuate a lot — it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. i make a lot more though so there's that. the pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. my wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a sahm which is what she's wanted. 

the issue is that my wife and i aren't on the same page about what this change would mean. before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. we also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). 

i told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. these cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and i also think it's practical.  she was mostly agreeable to that. but then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. 

i told her there was no way i was going to be taking on as many work hours as i am and then come home to cook or clean too. that would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

she looked at me like i was some sort of neanderthal but i think what i'm saying is completely fair. i'm not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. i recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce i would support her 100%. but i think it's fair that if i'm the sole paycheck and working crazy hours i don't come home to more stress and chaos. 

obviously my wife and i will have to work this out between ourselves. i'm mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base.

i don't know why she seems to have aged early or why i look younger - i was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. i used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).

i moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. last weekend i went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and i was shocked by her appearance.

i knew she used botox, but this was next level. her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. i asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". i'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.

she asked me not to tell anyone and i said of course i wouldn't. but then...

now, i thought she looked weird because i know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

i was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""it's probably because i didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

as a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, i was hurt by that. without thinking i blurted out (louder than i'd intended): ""oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

i regretted it before i'd even finished saying it, but i thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

my mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. my brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. pretty much everyone else thinks i am a massive asshole.

so, aita?",3
"meta ""the asshole"" is not neccesarily ""an asshole"".. sometimes on this sub, op's and commentors alike seem to get this idea that when they are judged ""the asshole"" that they are being personally attacked and insulted. 

just because yta, doesn't mean you're a dick, douche, jerk, etc. it just means you were in the wrong in the situation you posted about. commentors aren't insulting you personally when they call you ""the asshole"". ^^tm that's just the vernacular we use here.

"for telling the flight attendant to ask the woman in front of me to raise her seat up because it was pressing on my legs?. i was recently on a long (3+ hour) flight.  when we got airborne, the woman in front of me reclined her seat back, pressing them down on my kneecaps.  i am a tall person (6'5"") and generally don't fit into coach seats easily. i couldn't even put my tray down.  leaning my seat back doesn't really help. i wrangled myself out of my seat and asked her politely, ""i'm sorry ma'am, but i wonder if i could impose on you and ask to please raise your seat up just a few inches?  i don't have much space back there and with your seat pressing on my kneecaps, neither of us will be very comfortable during this long flight.  thank you.""  she just looked at me blankly, said ""no"", and closed her eyes.  i walked to the front of the plane and explained my situation to the flight attendant, who went back and spoke to the woman, who then reluctantly raised the seat up a bit.  when i got back into my seat, the woman turned around and hissed ""asshole"" at me.

"if i told my nieces their dad died and isn't me?. so my brother passed away in august, we're identical twins with the small exception that he had facial hair and i do not, other than that we're pretty much carbon copies. my sil did not take their kids (2 and 4) to the funeral as it would've been traumatic to them and i totally respect that, however, she has also let them believe that he is me. i've been at the house often helping out with the kids and doing whatever i can with them and i feel as if i am also sort of helping her in a way by not really letting them process that i am, in fact, not my brother. she's caught onto it too, but won't tell them and i think it's cruel on her part to do that to them. she has to be apart of the telling process but she keeps putting it off and i refuse to let it snowball into something far worse on the children and her. she's never made any advances toward me but i also believe in her mind this is how she's coping, by pretending he isn't really gone because she ""technically"" does still see ""his"" face everyday. would i be the asshole if i told them that their dad died and it's really just uncle j helping around the house?

i'm also concerned that at a certain point, i can't ""reintroduce"" myself back into their lives because i look exactly like him.",3
"for going off on a lady for calling the cops on me? wib if i reported her?. i'm black. my husband is white. he has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who loves me, and who i think isn't too bad herself. my niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. we hang out a lot to give my sil a break, and my husband doesn't really ""get kids"" so it's often 1x1. 

i was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. she was defiant, and i'm all about consequences after two warnings. she kept running from me laughing her butt off, so i told her it was time to go. normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a gigantic fit so i had to carry her. she wasn't screaming in a ""who is this help me"" way but in a clearly understandable ""no, i want to stay and play. auntie(me), no"" way. but also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. 

as we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. i smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. she then got in my face like ""do you know this child."" i'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so i just said yes and tried to step around her. she then said, ""you're not leaving until you prove you know that child."" i told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, ""no mother would ever say that about her kid"". yeah, maybe. but she can't spell so. she then demanded i give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. 

i was pissed. i told her i don't have to prove anything to her and i'm leaving with my kid. she then literally ran  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. cops called. security guy asks what's up. i was polite to him but i told the lady off. i said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to immediately jump to kidnapping was insane. the cops showed, and they asked my niece who i am ""auntie (me)!"" and i showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. it's done. 

she  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. i want to report it. she'd been watching us and saw my niece and i hanging for at least 30 minutes familiarly. so while i could have showed her the pictures, i didn't feel like i needed to. it's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. now, i have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. i'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. i just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""this isn't my mom"" card. and then i really would need the cops to be called because i'd kill her. 

i get she was concerned. and that unlikely i'd adopted a white baby. but also, 100% fuck off, lady. aita? would i be if i complained to the facility?",3
"for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?. my wife and i are not from the us but we have lived here for the last 2 years. on a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. however since we are not used to american portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.

when we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. we will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. however occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.

last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). when they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. we were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.

when we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. he asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. after around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". he gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.

here? this seems so foreign to me. we still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? it shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.

edit: sorry i could have worded the title better.

edit 2: another mistake. it should have said full service, not full",3
"for telling a friend's girlfriend that she's spoiled?. several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. before we start, some background about my friend: i've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. he worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. he paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. he recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.

on to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. i could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. when we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how ""at 33 years old i shouldn't have to take the bus anymore"", and ""taking public transportation is for losers"". as someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, i'll admit i took some offense to that. i've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it ""beneath me"".

the real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. here's where i may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. 

after a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. after they left, my wife said i shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and i almost ruined dinner for everyone. my friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.

"for allowing the girls on my hs track team (i'm the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?;. this is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because i'm honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. i just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that i have to be in his office monday morning and i'm scared shitless. 

basically i just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. the school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so i volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. we have some very talented girls and i enjoy it. 

we were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. on monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. they argued it was for thier comfort since it's about 80 here today. i was a little nervous but agreed. apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. i'm so naive i thought initially people were just being charitable but when i saw boys from surrounding schools i knew somthing was up. and it wasn't long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. the girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. 

parents are furious with me and obviously it's gone up the chain. i'm hoping to god i can chalk this up to my inexperience and i'm not fired buf when i had a 6'4"" dad screaming in my face that he's going to get my fired...i'm scared. 

am i the asshole for allowing this?

"for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?. okay this is so stupid and i really feel like i'm nta but my friend is adamant that i am so i'm seeking reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

my girl friends and i were recently at canada's wonderland and having been there dozens of times since i was a kid (am now in my 20s), i know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

so basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

well, for the last few times i've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and i always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. there never is and i use the bathroom stalls there. on my way out i'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

my friend now thinks i'm selfish and rude for doing this. she thinks that i should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

i don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

my friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. this is something i truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, i'm starting to question if she's right?

please tell me if i'm wrong, seriously, i don't get it. 

tl;dr: apparently i'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

edit: this is epic.. i really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. thank you to everyone that replied. i'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

and to all women, i'm sorry our bathrooms suck. i'll be even more helpful letting others know about those stalls in the future.. having to pee really bad and waiting is the worst. tiny bladder club!!",3
"for showing up at my cousin's wedding in a hoodie and jean shorts?. last fall, my husband and i went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

in the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. she was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. the wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. i thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. she didn't tell the couple tho. just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

we traveled 600 miles to the wedding. we treated the trip like a vacation. spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

the day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. i hate dressing up so i was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

my husband and i had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. a few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. i wore a hoodie, daisy duke shorts and cute sandals. 

i noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but i figured they didn't get the memo. the bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which i thought was weird for a casual wedding. the reception was awesome. nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. we had a blast. 

so we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. they thought it was very disrespectful. apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. this explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

tbh we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. and they never specified the dress code in the invitation. but i still have to ask. aita?",3
"for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body?. i made an alt account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
i'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so i'll try to keep it as pg as i can.

so, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. we have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
i will say that she's the first thin person i've ever been with. she's flat, petite and pretty short. most of the girls i've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and i've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
this all started when me and my girlfriend were watching netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if i was okay with her having a flat chest. (she's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) i asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that i never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. that kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) she said she was just curious.
i told her i had to be honest, and said that i'm not attracted to her chest size, and that i actually prefer bigger b-bs. it's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. if i'm being honest, that's why i usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
she was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. she texted me later on that night and told me what i said hurt her a little. she said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like i lied to her. i told her i didn't know what to tell her, and that i was just being honest (i was.).

am i being the asshole here?

"for telling the barista that my girlfriend is with me?. basically i'm 25m and she's 23f.

she gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. she cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. she always goes to the same coffee shop. 

me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. she always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. that was fine. 

anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. i trust her entirely, i know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

anyway, i went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. i ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and i shit you not he said ""oh is that for emma?"" and when i looked shocked he went ""i just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". i said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. the guy kinda laughed and i said that i appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, i think he was flirting. he laughed again and said sure thing. 


i didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare i embarrass her like that. this pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! she said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. 
fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay.

"for being mad at my wife for dumpster diving?. hi everyone, i'd like some input. 

my wife and i struggle to make ends meet. we strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. this includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

recently our dd dropped the milk and spilled it. it was 5 days to payday and we'd already done our grocery shopping. my wife said she'd figure it out. i know she has a little money stashed for herself that she's gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, i figured she must have decided to dip into that. boy was i wrong. 

the next week i noticed our food was a little...higher quality. a couple of brand name things, even a roast on sunday with asparagus. i figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when i asked she said ""oh no, i found a bunch of money off coupons."" then she showed a few to me. 

they were those ""earn 0.07$ a gallon"" receipts you get at the gas station. she had gone there and dug through the garbage! she said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

i was speechless. i asked her how she could lower herself like that. she replied that she did it for our kids. when i asked why she didn't use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

i'm so disgusted guys. i can't believe she did this. i don't even want to look at her. she on the other hand is mad at me, and says i'm an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. for expecting my wife not to dumpster dive?

edit: ok! i am definitely the asshole. after reading all of your comments, i really thought about it. i talked to my wife, and told her i was sorry for the way i acted. she is annoyed but willing to forgive me. i was actually mad at myself. the reason we are struggling is because i was in an accident a few months ago. i slid through a stop light on an icy road. it has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade i've worked in for 15 years. i'm on disability through my employer but it isn't even half of what i used to make. we are getting by, but it is tight. and i don't know what we are going to do when it runs out. my wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). i guess i was just mad at myself because i can't take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. i'm going to give her a foot rub tonight. thanks for the honesty guys.

"for making gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?. so, i've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. but basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

i've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

well, it didn't stop. 

anyway, since i'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, i've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until i kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

the noises are kind of, like, skreeeeeeeoooooooash! skreeeeascchhhhh! followed by snorts and the like.

so far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what i'm doing downstairs. i brush it off like it's no big deal and i really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. his audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor gargoyle rears its ugly head.

"for demanding access to my fiance's bank accounts?. edit 1: wow, thank you all so much for you input. i will post an update in a day or so

edit 2: please stop giving me awards this is a throwaway account. spend your money on people who make dank memes

the title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

my fiance and i are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, summer 2021.

i make pretty good money for my age. in fact, i make more money than any of my friends or family, and i would bet i'm in the ""1%"" of my community. i try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. i should also add when we started dating, i was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

my fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. she was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  since then, she hasn't worked. i really didn't mind at all. i make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

i am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead i just would venmo her some cash weekly. it was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

she has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. i know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  she has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

i shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

i told her i would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so i could see exactly what she was spending it on. i could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but i hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

she blew up. telling me i wasn't trusting her and how i was the one against joint bank accounts so i should understand her privacy. yeah, huge red flags all over the place.

i talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying i was not respecting her privacy when i'm the one that demands it also.

"for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?. tl;dr at bottom

okay so i'm almost 19.

when my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. they got married later on, converted to christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

i know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. he didn't say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. i thought it's weird they never told their daughters, given that they're all such protestors against abortion.

but anyways dad also has a sister, who's daughter i'm really close with. she's christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last may. then her boyfriend left her over it. i absolutely adore her baby, and i try to help raise him given that he doesn't have a father.

i'm usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle's daughters, and i was messaging them three way last night. i was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why i would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

i told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. but they overrode me, saying that she's easy and shouldn't have spread her legs blah blah blah. it went on for a few more messages.

i got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

""yeah i hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.""

three hours later and there was still no response; i knew i was in deep shit.

and i was! my parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning i'm using my old old old phone right now. they were very tense with me today. i was very earnest. 

i always like posting online where no one can physically judge me, so thus i ask, for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?

all that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""sarah"" and it's ""sara"" and i said, ""who cares, just scrape off the h"" but she insisted on returning it. so i said ""fine whatever."" and then as she's leaving she says since i screwed up already i should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

and i go into the kitchen and i ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" she says ""the gift bags."" i found all the candy and toys and what i thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. so i make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

my wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt i made at helping. so a little while after that, the guests arrive. the day went pretty well until the end. my daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. my wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until i got the box. she looked inside an was horrified

""what the fuck is this?"" she whispers. and she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. i follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. she's so embarrassed. why? she wont say. i'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. i then i just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically i'm stupid and i've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? i tell her ""it's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. she says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

so yeah i've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. i told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said i was a huge asshole and she's mad that i dont think it's a big deal. and i still dont. actually, i think i'm the one that should be mad at her for keeping this going for almost a week.

so, reddit, aita?

tl;dr: i used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6 year old daughter's bday party",3
"for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?. so i have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when i was 13. i never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. it's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

i worked with him on and off through college and i've gotten very good at it.

he asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after i graduated. but my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

i do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. he also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

to no one's surprise, my father said i needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

i refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. my father was upset but i guess he figured he couldn't stop me. we continued having weekly dinners.

for some reason, people are liking my company's work more. i have expanded my company more than my father ever has. i also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. i don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless i want to.

last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. i admit i did feel bad so i offered him a full time job in my company and that i'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. but i told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

this made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. he said i betrayed him. then i basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

i do feel kind of guilty i ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. but at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

"for telling my kid i would help him get a switch if he can beat ocarina of time?. my 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a nintendo switch so he can play botw. right now he has $200 saved up. at his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

i know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn't been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. now i have to say, he's a really good kid. kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. he's been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, i thought of a more fun solution to help him get his switch. i told him, if you can beat ocarina of time (without googling for help - though i would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old n64, i'll pay for the rest of your switch and get you botw. wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. part of my reasoning too is i just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and oot is a timeless classic. 

he jumped at the idea! after a weekend of playing, he's already at zoras domain as young link. he seems to be having fun with it and hasn't gotten too frustrated yet. he's only played minecraft really so the dated graphics don't bother him either. 

but anyway i told a couple friends about it, and they think i'm a massive dick. that i'm trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that i should just get him the switch because he's already such a good kid. now i'm having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge. 

so aita?",3
"for ""double-reporting"" an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired?. my husband and i have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is african american and i am white (this will be important later on in the story). my son just got his driver's permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. the other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

i scolded my son and gave a ""sorry"" wave to the driver. at the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. his car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. he rolled down the window and shouted the n-word at my son. my son's face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. the encounter **sickened** me.

i did some research on the company; at one point i even plugged them into facebook. they have a very active facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. i called the company and reported the man's behavior, describing him very vividly. they informed me that they knew exactly who i was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. i had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

two months later, when i was browsing facebook kind of boredly one day, the company's name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it i clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. one of the very first photos/posts i saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. to my horror, i saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. meaning they didn't fire him.

the company is part of a nationwide chain, so i called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person i could get to, and i reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn't fire him. the man i spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person i'd reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have ""no place"" and ""no future"" in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee's career is now toast.

was it right of me to ""double-report"" this guy? i'm sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that i was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. am i an asshole or a ""karen"" for not dropping this matter?",3

soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.

"my favorite joke: everyone knows dave. dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them.""

tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""ok, dave, how about tom cruise?""

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it.""
so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,

 ""dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go. 

at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope.""
he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam.. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

"serious just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.. a few days ago i was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

i decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until i decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

here's the joke i told:

""what do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

throw your washing (laundry if you're american) in.""

one of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. when i asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

obviously i felt mortified as i didn't know about it, and said ""i'm so sorry to hear that. did he drown?""

""no,"" replied the guy. ""he choked on a sock.""",0

amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.
he follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and
trot across the road to a bus-stop.
the dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.
when a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.
the butcher follows, dumbstruck.
as the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.
after awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell,
then the butcher follows him off.
the dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.
he goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door.
he does this again and again. no answer.
so he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,
jumps off, and waits at the front door.
a big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.
the butcher runs up and screams at the guy: ""what the hell are you doing?
this dog's a genius!""
the owner responds, ""genius, my ass.........

"a mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up. so, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  he glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  when he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  he thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

a few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  he glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  he thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

the next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  he opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  the mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.*

the door opens and standing there is a stout buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

""pardon me, sir,"" the mailman says, ""but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it's only going to end up back at your home in a few days.""

""ah, my letter.  thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  please do so again"" replies the buddhist monk.

""but sir,"" says mailman, ""you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.""

""but that is my intention, dear man,"" replies the buddhist monk.  ""you see, reposting is the best way to get karma.""

""oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.

the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.

so, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?""

"several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community.... if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.

however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other

the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

next, the pope waved his finger around his head. the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

the rabbi pulled out an apple.

with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. the jews could stay in italy!

later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened. the pope said, 'first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs.' 'then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us.' 'finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'he bested me at every move and i could not continue!'

meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. 'i don't have a clue!!!' the rabbi said. 'first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger.' then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here. 'and then what?' asked a woman. 'who knows...' said the rabbi. 'he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!'",0

"there was this tramp.. one cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. he managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. he took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

coincidentally the father drives up. ""how can i ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""just name your price - i'm a wealthy man.""

""ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, i'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""oh dear,"" says the father, ""i don't carry much cash with me, i only have ten pounds - but come home with me and i'll get more from the safe.""

""no! no!"" says the tramp, ""why ten pounds is more money than i've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""i'm rich! i'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

he finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""i'll have one holiday please!""

""ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""oh, any holiday i don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""ten pounds! you'll never get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

she goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. there - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""i've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""i'll take it!""

a few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""but i've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and i want on!""

""well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, i don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. come back at midnight when it's dark and i'll let you on then.""

so the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. it was the captain.

""hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

the tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

first they went down through the first class level: oriental carpets - 6"" pile. a genuine rembrandt on every wall. leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

then the second class: as above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""a room of my very own.""

""i'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. so that's what the alarm clock is for. enjoy your cruise.""

well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. one-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. he had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

he climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""that was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""where did you learn to dive like that?""

""um, well i've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""i've never seen..."" he broke off. ""hey, i've got an idea"", he started again. ""how would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. i'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""it's a deal!"" says our man. for the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""okay, i'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. we're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""okay,"" agreed the tramp.

two days passed, and the big day arrived. the ship was humming with excitement. everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. the captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""let's see what you can do."" and with that the captain handed him a walkie talkie. and the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the solar system...

he reached the board.

he climbed on top and radioed the captain...

faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""i can see him!"" yelled a passenger, ""look!!!""

the tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

not a ripple on the surface!

down through the water!

smashed through the pool bottom!

down through the first deck!

smashing through the second!

down!

down!

through the crew's quarters!

through the engine rooms!

smashing through his own little cabin!

and down through the double-strength steel hull of the ship!

still down...!

deeper,

deeper into the murky depths,

till.........

smash!

into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

up and up, desperate, gasping...

out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""hero!"" ""wonderful!"" ""amazing!"" ""good show that!""

and handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""well tramp, i have never seen anything like that, ever. that was the most *stupendous* piece of diving i have ever seen.""

the tramp blushed.

the captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

and the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""well you see...

""for me to tell you, i'll need $49.95""

the captain outrageously asked why.

the tramp said

"gay couple on a plane. a gay couple (jeremiah and timothy) is traveling on a plane. 

""what if we had sex?"" asks jeremiah.

""are you crazy? here, on the plane? it would be awkward, everyone would watch us doing it...""

""nobody is even paying attention to anything. look!""

jeremiah stands up and asks loudly:

""could i have a napkin, please?""

nobody gives a damn. everyone is sleeping, reading, looking out the window, etc.  flight attendants pretend to not hear them, as they also don't give a damn.

""they really wouldn't care then, would they?"" says timothy.

so jeremiah and timothy have wild sex on the plane.

later, when the plane arrives to the airport and the people are leaving, the stewardess sees an old man who threw up all over his shirt, even his pants are soaking in the filth.

""sir, you should've asked for a bag!""

""i didn't dare"" whispers the old man. ""a few rows ahead i saw a man asking for a napkin and he got fucked in the ass...""",0

""oh, it's just a statue,"" she replied nonchalantly. ""the smiths bought one for their bedroom. i liked it so much, i got one for us too."" 

no more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.

"4 years ago today, i shared the worst joke i ever created. here it is again for those that missed it.. there are two identical twin brothers that live together. one happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. one saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. he tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. after some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. in the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. he turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
about 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. his vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. an ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. he ends up in the emergency room under observation, but his condition is critical. they try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
the dentist wakes to a knock on the door. suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. when he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. he is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
the grim reaper swears. ""oh no! this always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""what do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and i've come to take him to the underworld. i'm afraid his time on earth has ended. i'll take my leave now.""  
  
the dentist is noticeably upset. he says ""wait! isn't there some way i can challenge you for my brother's life? after all, you made the mistake. certainly there must be a way i can bargain for his life.""  
  
the grim reaper asks ""what do you have in mind?""  
  
the dentist thinks. ""how about a challenge? if i beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
the grim reaper laughs. ""i will beat you in any challenge. what challenge do you propose?""  
  
the dentist smiles. ""i propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. it's glistening. he takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. after 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. the grim reaper grins. ""you are foolish human. but, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
the dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. when his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. he smiles.  
  
it's unbelievable.  
  
the shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
the winner is obvious. the grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""you win, human. this time. your brother will live."" he disappears in a puff of smoke. at the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. it's his brother, the dentist. he picks up. ""hey bro. you'll never believe what happened. apparently, i went out to the market and got hit by a car. they say i almost died.""  
  
the dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""that's interesting, bro. today you might say that i also had a brush with death.""",0

"once upon a time there lived a beautiful queen with large breasts. nick the dragon slayer obsessed over the queen for this reason. he knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 


one day nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,horatio the physician, the king's chief doctor.horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 


without pause nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

the next day, horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the queen's bra while she bathed. soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

upon being summoned to the royal chambers to address this incident, horatio informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

the king, eager to help his queen, quickly summoned nick to their chambers. 

horatio then slipped nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, nick worked passionately on the queen's large and magnificent breasts. the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

upon returning to his chamber, nick found horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. with his obsession now satisfied, nick couldn't have cared less knowing that horatio could never report this matter to the king and with a laugh told him to get lost.

the next day, horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's underwear. the king immediately summoned nick.

"super awesome update sat down on my friend's macbook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.. i never thought this would turn out the way it did and i really felt like i learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

i went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and i sincerely thank each and every one of you.

i did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so i wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, i'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. she sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

i got served a few days later and went to court. i told the judge i gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current macbook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (i printed out the email i sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. i also told him that when i offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no i want the money in cash. when i told her i'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. i tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

she gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case i guess. after listening to both of us he ruled that i pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. so i'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

if it weren't for you guys i would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and i honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

i feel good for following all the advice here.

"(update) neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

i'm sad about this update for the kid, i took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because i had questions about an issue i'm having and briefly explained it.

officer shows up, i invite him in and explain the whole situation. he isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. supervisor shows up and i go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where i have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

we watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. a few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what i put on the drive and then signed it, i repeated it all 3 times.

about 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 cps workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. this took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as i remember it and left out anything i wasn't 100% sure on.

the officers and cps workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times i'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

after they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. i'm in my garage so i don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the cps workers van and they left. the father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

i talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

i haven't seen them since the day after the post, i feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (i didn't think it was anything like they found, i just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). i should have called them earlier once the cps reports i was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",2
"i think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. he is a doctor.. this is in north texas. 

hey so i must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. i started typing it up in word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

i think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. i know this is going to be hard to explain, but i have been having gaps in memory that i have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  i was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then i started to notice that this seems to happen when i go on dates with him. 

i know it must be crazy, but i have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  i know its him as… well i wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

the first time it happened was when we were drinking and i wrote it off as too much to drink. we get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. but then there were a few times when i know we were not drinking. 

i decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. i had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time i talked with him. i remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. my car and his car was in the parking lot too so i was confused. 

i decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

after 3 days at his place i remembered everything so i was started to trust him again. knowing he was an ent i know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. i was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said i should be treating those sores. 

i had completely forgotten they were there. these little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. i got so freaked out he mentioned them that i decided to leave. 

the next day he came over to ""check on me"" and i remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. i never agreed to me with him and would never want to. he does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something i have no memory of. 

i am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

this has started to affect my work life as well as i start to get paranoid when i see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. i get paranoid that they are about to fire me. my friends also state i have been acting strangely and out of character. i have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when i do.  

is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? i do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so i want to be damn sure when i go to the police.

"neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive. male, late 20's, co

i quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (i haven't consumed alcohol in years) and i replaced that habit with drinking martinelli's sparkling apple juice. the juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to corona beer bottles. 
here lies my issue:
this morning i was walking to my car from my apartment and i had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. my neighbors basically jumped me from behind. one grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. he was saying stuff like ""the nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" as a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and i think my nose is fractured. most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that i was not about drink and drive, but that i was drinking apple juice. this all just happened. i'm calling the cops. any suggestions?

btw, i didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. they said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

"update pa i followed and reported a drunk driver, then i got a ticket for driving past curfew. this is an update to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

i took the advice that i was given and i pled not guilty. last week i went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200b;

i brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that i called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. i also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and i printed out a copy of the ""justification"" law(https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/conscheck.cfm?txttype=htm&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

the hearing started with the officer saying that i was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why i was there, and that i voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. he said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

then it was my turn to speak. i said that while i did drive past curfew, it was because i had noticed an erratic driver and i was following him because i thought he was going to hurt someone. i felt that if i had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. i gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and i said that i would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. i argued that i had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 bac. (the judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the bac.)

finally, i brought up the justification defense. i argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. i said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because i drove in an otherwise safe manner.

the judge agreed and found me not guilty! he said that i had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that i had done the right thing. i'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200b;

tl;dr: went to court. police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" i presented my defense that i was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. judge agreed; i was found not guilty!",2
"i told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.. i got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. i didn't tell him all the details, but i told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and i showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. at first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because i told him i'd run away and call the police if he did.

he called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. they talked to us away from eachother and i had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who i told everything real specific. she was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

we went back home with them and i showed the police where my mother kept drugs that i'm pretty sure we're illegal. she wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and i don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs i think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. i think they're gonna look into it though. 

there were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. like a shelter or something. 

i should of done this year's ago, i feel really bad because i could have had my siblings taken better care of. i don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place i'm in now is way cleaner than i'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. they weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. they also weren't very happy with our house i could tell.

thanks to everyone's terrific advice, i got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to rainn) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and i were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

one of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching i am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting i was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (i'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

the ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

"update: my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... i got custody!!!. **edit: per the bots request, i am required to tell you that i live in washington (wa)**

here's my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

so after one of the most stressful months of my life, i can happily tell you all that i got custody of my step sister.

i did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people i've ever met in my life. i told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

after my step sisters bio dad was informed that i would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. the lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. she said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

after her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, i then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. i've never signed so many things in my entire life. because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, i was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

yesterday, i signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that i had 100% custody of my step sister. after i signed, we both cried and cried for hours. we're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. as i write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

the past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. i consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision i've ever made. these events have made me realise that family isn't just dna based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. i owe all of you for the rest of your lives. once i turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

i hope you all lead wonderful lives. give your loved ones a big hug for me.",2
"my wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! i'm growing very worried. posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

title says it all. we've been married for 3 years now. she's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. however, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in ft.knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... no, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. but now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

she got sucked into one of those anti-vax facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking wawa for 10 years. she messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on facebook. 

i love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her vitamin k shot, and the hep-b vaccine. however, now she's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

i know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. all her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <x disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <y vaccine>""

""i'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, i know i'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

i've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" by showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. she followed that one up with ""we aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! they're completely different!""

i've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. she follows that up with ""those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

she won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and i'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

i am in florida. is there anyway i can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? what are my options here? legally speaking, what kind of leeway do i have? i don't want this to lead to divorce but i just feel quite lost at the moment. 

edit: thank you to everyone for your advice! i come to the decision that i will try and sit my wife down one last time, as i am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome i desire. if that fails, i have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because i know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. will keep you updated",2
"update to: someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when i was underage and i'm terrified that i'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (ohio). original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

so as the title states, last year i was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when i was 14/15. i thought i would update now that it's come to a resolution.

i went to see a lawyer the day after i made that post. he drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that i had nothing to worry about. it was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. then i got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

i panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. he was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. he was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). i wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that i wasn't really allowed to know about.

anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus i'm getting married in a few months and i'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. so i thought i'd update here with the good news! i was afraid that i'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys i got up the courage to deal with the situation. i really appreciate the advice i got here! thank you again so much.

"i was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the da finally got around to my case. i did nothing wrong.. okay, so a few days ago i was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. i lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

i was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (i'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest i didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something i did not do). i had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where i was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. i'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything i told him to at this appearance i had because a simple background check shows i don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened i was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). he literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

so then i sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. i tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper i had but he was never in and never came to see me. i couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. i don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, i was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because i can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months i'm about to owe.

when he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the da who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter i mailed them until then also. after that appearance i got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and i was released.

what can i do for any of this? apparently someone with the same name but a different dob shot a building after a fight and is a felon but i sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless i pay some crazy fees (how am i liable for these fees if it was a error?!). this is in madison, wisconsin

edit: thanks for all the replies guys and gals, i'll contact the wisconsin branch of the aclu tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. also i appreciate the messages offering to help me if i need it but i can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

edit 2: to clear up more confusion about my car. the city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. the storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and i only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. the towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and i can get my car but told ""good luck"". also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",2

"subaru service center gave my car to someone else. final update

so i dropped my subaru wrx off to be serviced at a third party service center.  they called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when i arrived today i waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  they offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  should i take any action against them/is there any action i can take against them. 

<edit: i need to clarify a mistake i made earlier when posting this, they are not an official subaru service center as i previously thought.  they are just a third party service center, i have and do not want any hate going out towards subaru, they did nothing.  this was not their fault and i love their cars/company.  i will be posting a final update later tonight about how everything is ending.  thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

edit:

thank you all for all of the advice.  im not good with legal stuff and if i had not posted here i probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  i called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while i called the cops.  i still have not seen it but i was told the damage was extensive and that i would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  at this point im going to get a lawyer involved right? i shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  even if they offer to cover fixing it im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  they if i didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but im really not having that.  not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

final update:
hey guys i just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  i did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  little backstory, when i first bought the car in november the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  that is what i was getting fixed.  that being said, in the end i will be getting a new 2019 wrx, i am pressing charges against the sm for theft, i have filed official complaints with the motor vehicle dealer board and the office of the attorney general consumer protection section, and i will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  luckily my lawyer was pro bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  all in all i am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  without this thread i would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  for everyone dm'ing me and asking about what the location is, i am not at liberty now nor will i be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  it is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  thanks again everyone!

my location is washington dc

"update, my son took the boba fett figure.. so, i never honestly expected the post i made to get where it did. i also never expected the barrage of support and hate. i will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200b;

so, why am i back? well, because i feel like i need to be. i'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how i acted or seek validation. i'm here because i feel that for myself i need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200b;

so, i want to talk about something first before i get into the update. many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how i reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. i was also hit pretty hard for how i was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. to give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. we have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. we're just to different in some senses. he's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. in these past few years we've tried to fix this. work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. during our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and i wont lie i never understood the appeal. it is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200b;

so, when my son stole and damaged his property i didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. so when he asked for 2,000 to fix it i really didn't feel like it was worth it. was this wrong of me? maybe. i don't feel bad about defending my son, i only feel bad that i discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200b;

sorry about that. like i said, i don't want sympathy. i only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

so, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. i had no idea what i was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. we collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. during this time i got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. i offered to pay in full.

(also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so i asked him. he had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

my brother said he plans to not sue us. his renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. at first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. this was the plan until last night.

during the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. it turns out my son stole the figure to sell. he had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. he didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

suffice to say, i am not happy about this. i won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. my brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly i think this might be for the best in the end. the way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and i believe the only option that i can live with myself making is this. i will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

so, thank you all for the advice. the support and hate are what i needed as a true wake up call. like i said, i don't need pity. i'm doing this so that i can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",2
"my daughter disowned my underage grandson. what do i do?. i posted in r/justnofamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. 


my sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. he travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. i found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first i'm hearing about it. 


i phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. she said some very nasty things. i honestly thought i raised her better than to act in such a manner. but my grandson doesn't want to go back home, i'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but i want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

"co my ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. she now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. i want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.. me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. there were a variety of reasons for this that i wont get into here. one of them though was her anti-science beliefs. she's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200b;

we have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. my ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. and threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200b;

around this time i also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. when this happened i decided i wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. the only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. my ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. the judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200b;

ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" i demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. so, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. she somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. i have been stressed out from the minute i got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. my daughter must have picked up on this and thought i was mad at her because when i was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200b;

turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. she made my daughter lie about it. instead she has been using ""special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" what about the forms i got saying she was vaccinate? there fake. i called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. so my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200b;

i'm pissed to say the least. my daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. my ex doesn't know i know yet and i told my daughter not to tell her, i want her gone now. how do i approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. i have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. i also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones i have a forged. i'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but i would like to know going in what to do. thank you.",2
"little sister (16) needs an abortion. texas wants parental consent which we can't get. can i take her to new mexico? (update: it's done). https://redd.it/6m79kf

so it is done. we called an abortion clinic in new mexico and asked for advice. they were very helpful. scheduled an appointment.

i told my parents that i'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in new mexico for 2 days. they never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. so in the morning i picked her up and we drove to new mexico. we took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. she spent the day and that night at my place. i called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so i'll bring her there tomorrow.

she was feeling fine by then. so nothing suspicious at all. she's very happy this worked out the way it did and i'm happy that she's happy. i told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. you can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. once we knew i won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",2
"update mn school is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. i'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.. i'm updating my last post(https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

i did what you all told me to do. i wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. i also called them. they said they will speak with the school.

i was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. i did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

i said loudly ""i think you owe me an apology.""

she said ""yes, i should not have accused you of cheating.""

i said ""yes, and another apology for saying i don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

she said ""i'm sorry"" and left.

the principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

i said ""it wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

he apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. i then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

so things are sorted out now. but also, i'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. i only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and i was very pissed off at them. and the counselor had given me horrible advice.

thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",2
"update - my brother went missing 6 years ago. police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? how do we get more information. illinois.. https://redd.it/74we5z

i talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. they found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. the officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

there days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed dna samples to confirm. dna confirmed it was him.

what happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). that was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. that's when they decided to... his friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

the officer says my brother didn't die in pain. it was multiple gunshots. you'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. we had a funeral for him. now there's a place that i can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

i thank all of you who helped.

"update had a falling out with the girl i love and got served a cease and desist order. what can i legally do? michigan (x-post on r/relationships). past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

oh boy. i've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. i wasn't going to, but i know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and i actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and i read all the comments there. it was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. i decided i needed to post again for some closure. i would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

for those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so i'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. i want to take full accountability for everything, so i want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

first, i want to assure everyone that i didn't contact that girl ever again. since i moved, i no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (i don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. i have avoided getting any information about her at all). the way i acted and the way i hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but i know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. if she wants to get closure by talking to me, i'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. i don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. i learned in my classes that men do that a lot. i don't want to hurt her anymore, so i will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

i was distraught after my last post here. i admit i came here looking for validation, not help. i had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that i was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that i needed help. all of these people were right. i don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive i was in response to the comments). i checked myself into therapy in michigan the week after i posted here. i knew something was wrong, but i was still in denial. i thought i needed help with heartbreak. i didn't recognize that i actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that i used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. after a few sessions, i started seeing a psychiatrist too. i got on mood stabilizers and i started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way i was acting. something that couldn't be cured by medication. after talking it over with my therapist, i decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my aunt's house. within a month of me posting here, i had moved into her house. 

after moving, i started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. i had a fresh idea of the issues i wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that i was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in michigan (though i wasn't stalking anyone at this point, i was just obsessing in my mind. which is still bad, but i wasn't actively victimizing anyone). i realize that in addition to therapy, i needed more help. my therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so i signed up voluntarily. i attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. the goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  i know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? people like me. people like me in the last post. i look like a normal person. i grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. monsters come in all shapes and sizes and i fooled myself by saying because i didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because i wasn't ""like"" the abusers i saw on tv, that i wasn't one. but i am. i can't take back what i've done, but i can promise myself i will never victimize anyone else again. 

in conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. i want to say that i do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. i made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because i thought i had the right to dictate how others interact with me. the class is a year-long class and i have only been in it for a month, but i have already learned so much. i have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. but i believe that since i've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. i've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so i made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people i am stalking or believe i am in love with (i talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and i'm sorry for how i decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice i asked for.

**tl;dr**: i ceased, i desisted, and i got mental health help. thanks to everyone.

**edit**: wow, just wow. i didn't expect this response. i guess this is a top post of all time. 
i wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. i read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though i didn't reply to many. i cried a lot while reading them. 

2. i didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. i'm not sure why i did it, but i don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. i don't know if i deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. but thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. i've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program i am in. the program i am in is specific to my area, so i'd rather not disclose the name. however, i encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" i did some research today about the class i am in and that is what these types of classes are called. they all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. there is no official federal program i don't think.

4. i am not healed. i have a lot of obsessive thoughts and i have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. my meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process i need to change and that cant be done with pills. i have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. i have never had real ""friends"" until the ones i have now. before jaime, i definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women i had crushes on and men i wanted to be friends with. it was never as bad as it was with jaime, but i still am sure i made people uncomfortable.  i also have some self-harm behaviors i am working out. so to the person who was worried that i would use all of the good praise to say ""oh i'm perfect now so i can do what i want,"" trust me, i know i am fucked up and i want to change. i want to have normal relationships and friendships. i want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

please get help if you need it. take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",2
"update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. i'm back after 6 months.. you can read my old post here: florida: parents hired people to kidnap me. my brother ended up pointing a gun at them. what do i need to do to get emancipated?(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i sadly don't have any good news. just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. the camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

the place wasn't like anything i imagined it would be. i tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. they also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. whatever you do they see it as resistance. their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. even when i was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. it took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that i'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. i got to the point that i didn't care about anything anymore, i just wanted it to end.

they knew about my youtube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. they had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if i truly hate my old self or not. she'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also youtuber) and i was supposed to agree with her, if i took things personally they knew i was acting and wasn't ready.

they got me when i was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. the next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. i was thinking all the time and effort i placed there was gone.

from there i didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. so things became easier. they'd teach me to be a nice girly christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. it was like they were sending me into a children's book. then my dad came and brought me back home.

when i got back my brother actually told me that my youtube account wasn't deleted. since i was using his email for recovery he got a notification when i logged in from the camp because it was a new place. so he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. so my account is intact. the assholes at the camp were lying.

i don't know if i'm the same person or not or how much i've changed but i really hate my parents. i hate them so much that a year ago i couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. there are 448 days until i'm 18 and i'm counting every single day until this is over and then i'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

my big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who i trust. when i was gone he went to police, cps, even talked to a lawyer and a pi to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. my parents came after my $15,000 which i had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. but my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. he continued to post the videos that i had prepared in the pipeline when i was gone so i continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

that's it for me. from what i understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",2
"can i get a paternity test on myself?. hi, i'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. i had a much older sister who killed herself when i was 6. she was 26 when she died. all of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. i don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. my parents don't talk much about her. there's a painting in our house that she painted. it's a very nice painting of a swamp. it's my favorite thing. i decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. what i found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. i felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then i read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. it's really short and i didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical i guess is the word. anyways i asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why i would ask that. i said idk i just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. she got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. well i started thinking about it. i am the spitting image of my sister but i don't look like my mom or dad. i casually asked my mom to see my birth certificate the next day and she got mad again and wouldn't let me see it.

my mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. i've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". i say that in quotes because i have no fucking clue who they are. when i'm around they never mention any group names or what ""organization"" they work for or are apart of. because of this i have not had much luck finding out stuff as ""new age cult"" gives to many results to look into.

this monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. they told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. according to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. i tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. according to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. i've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but i've been unable too. they cut of the internet, phone and tv tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. i'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way i've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. i was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that i will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

&#x200b;

i need to know what the fuck i can do here. my dad has shared custody of me and since monday i've had no contact with him. he is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. i tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. he lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. i'm at a friends house because i was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after i told my parents i wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and i plan to stay here tonight if i can. my parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

i'm so lost right now it makes me sick. i do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and i need to know what the fuck i can do here. can i just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. if my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

edit:

i talked to my mom and told her because i would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times i could see my friend i would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". i got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. he did not agree and was told i didn't want to talk to him. my 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. my sisters dad is going to call cps too and i just got done with my call to them but i wont repeat what they said here. i will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to florida immediately if i don't check in with him or he hears i went back to her. he says that he is already looking into emergency custody (i want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. they both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). i also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. my dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. thanks guys for the advice.",2

raised hell with the county commissioner for my district, showed them video and threatened to lawyer up, he pulled in the director for the road and bridge department then pulled in the director of zoning and planning.

my driveway is no longer a road and i am no longer being assessed for repairs and i am legally allowed to do what is necessary to stop traffic from crossing my property so both sides of the property have been ditched and bermed and a steel pole gate across the side i plan on keeping open. sheriffs dept has been out multiple times dealing with people trying to enter the property but they are starting to get the hint that road is closed.

we are currently in negotiations for a portion of my property to be purchased and turned into a road but not 10 feet from my house, there is a county commissioners meeting next tuesday and it is on the docket to be brought up.

&#x200b;

my driveway is no longer on google maps as a road, signage posted private property no trespassing, dead end road, etc etc etc. several people are angry about it as they are used to the pass-through but with the cameras i have installed i've been able to get clear images of vehicles and license plates of the worst offenders and they will be cited according to the sheriffs dept.

i have contacted amazon and ups about their trucks crossing my property, ups has instructed their drivers to no longer use that route, haven't heard a thing back from amazon yet but i have stopped two of their trucks so far,both of which were ticketed by the sheriffs dept and the one needing a tow to get pulled off the berm it got stuck on.

"update i take prescription medication for adhd. started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. left old job for new one and now i'm unemployed.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

i am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

i met with an attorney for a consultation thursday. after talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has adhd. i could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. she told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as i could get punitive damages. i told her i don't want to sue anyone if i don't have to, i just want this job offer back as i have been waiting a long time for a job like this. she also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, i could file an eeoc charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. due to an unrelated incident a while back, i have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my google drive. i played the calls with my manager to the attorney. when my manager informed me of the preliminary result i explained to her my prescription medication and my adhd. the attorney told me it was good that i disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and adhd would not cause any issues in performing my duties). i was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. the call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but i would be paid for my one day of work. as far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if i knew i would fail. i had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

i asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because i signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. she would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. she said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. she said ultimately the point of having a lab test and mro is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the mro is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. if it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of hr and their legal department. when she initially talked to the head of hr, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. he called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. my attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if i could come into her office that afternoon. i agreed.

when i was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of hr, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. essentially this call was an apology to me. the head of hr profusely apologized for this. he went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in hr and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. if he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. he went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of hr felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. they want me to come back in monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. he stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" he even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch monday.

he told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my adhd. i told them that wasn't necessary as i am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

so now i have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of hr. i owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. i wish i could personally shake hands with all of you. i was so scared before reading your comments. thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

edit: i'm going to disclose my medication. i take vyvanse. a lot of people assume i'm taking adderall. i used to take adderall but my doctor suggested i try vyvanse when it came out. although similar and made by the same company, vyvanse is a much better medication for me. the release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as adderall, my appetite is not affected, i sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that adderall does when wearing off.

"ex-wife is suing me for child support. i don't even have a penis... (update). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i have both good news and bad news.

the good news is that i won the battle with my ex. i put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. i had documents about me showing i don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (i don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before i married her. however paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. that ended the case. it took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but i won. i don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. maybe she thought that i won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

the bad news is that, i'm dying. as i mentioned in the comments of my original post, i was battling cancer at the time that i made the post. it was the fourth time in my life that i was dealing with cancer and even though i had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and i have very little chance of beating it again. i will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. i'm happy with the life i've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until i finally rest for good. 

thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. it helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. you could see from my comments on the original post that i was almost ready to give up. ",2
"(az) our neighbors dog was poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. i say absolutely not. how should we proceed?. i guess some background is in order here. earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. we were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. the next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. they did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. the next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. this all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

so they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. we tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

so we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. we have yet to contact the lawyer. 

we had made the initial report to animal control last thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" i was really taken aback and i think i asked ""i think so, do you need some?"" 

he then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. i literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. i explained that i actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and i really have no way of knowing which dog is which). he said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" i got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


the officer then asked if he could take everything. i said i wasn't comfortable with that but i would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. i did exactly this. i was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. again i was taken completely aback and said that i'm not sure what he'd be looking for. he told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. it took me as second but i asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. i asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if i remember) ""not yet."" 
i asked him if i could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. i said i would really rather not but i would get back in touch with him. he gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

i just got home and told my wife. my wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. we have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but i feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

she thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. i say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. i'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. wife thinks we should let them, i say absolutely not.

>edit: hey guys i'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in dm but it would sure be easier if i could just answer them once. i'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, i really don't want to say where i am and my attorneys name. all the laws i found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

so thank you to everyone who responded. and i guess thank you to everyone in the dms who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, i want to sleep in my own house. just to allay the fears of the other nice dm's, i did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

i took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on monday night. i also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. i called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

he was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the da actually pursuing this were slim to none. he did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, i could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. he said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


so basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as i type this) but i just heard (wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. in fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. the people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. they also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all i know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people i've ever encountered). the can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). so with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

so our complaint to animal control from last thursday is still on the books. the lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. the criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing. i had purchased a used cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic i knew. he said his son was driving it. when i first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of bho oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. i threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
flash forward to the other night and i was pulled over for an improper lane change. officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when i was being pulled over. he asked to search the vehicle and which point i said no. waited half an hour for the dog to show up. he alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  he checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. after his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. they cut into the leather seats. they also cut into my spare tire. mind you, i have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. they cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. i'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. after this well over 2 hour ordeal, i was told i was free to go. when asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. before i do that i would like to know if there's any better options and how i should pursue this. the seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what i probably would've payed for it. not to mention they also ruined my spare. thank you.

"neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. for the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

at first i just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. however after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

i've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

she will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. i've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. i don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

when she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when i'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. before i started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. now since i've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. somehow this is my fault.

now i'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred german shepard, an english bulldog and a mix sheppard/bulldog).

i just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. i have a pool and if she falls in when i'm not home she could very well drown. that's why i installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, i truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

i've called the local child and family services office (cps) several times in the past two months to report it because i feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. i have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that i've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when i open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

i feel like i've done everything i can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. i just have no idea what to do now? i've debated calling the police when she enters but i don't know how that will escalate.",2

i watched the vhs tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. that's why he kept his savings in cash. he didn't even trust a safe deposit box. that's why they were kept in his walls. and it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. i found the other $20,000.

i went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. she talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

i scheduled an appointment with the bank. when i told them it's for a cash deposit they told me i don't need an appointment for that but i told them it's for a large deposit. they still said no appointment is necessary, but then i said it's a very large deposit. so they booked the appointment. everything went smoothly at the bank. they made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. money was in my account a few hours later.

i made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and i now have a larger emergency fund.

thanks! ",2
"i'm a us citizen living and stuck in iran. i want to come to the us. update.. https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8688pj/im_a_us_citizen_living_and_stuck_in_iran_i_want/

i am now back in the us. it wasn't easy and took a long time mostly because my parents had hid all my american documents from me. but i found them, took originals and replaced them with copies. they never noticed.

the office of foreign interests at the swiss embassy were very helpful although they didn't do anything until i had the documents proving that i'm a us citizen. i was able to exit iran by going on a vacation with my family to turkey and i just did not come back with them. the foreign interests office arranged everything so that i could go to the us consulate in istanbul, they were already in the loop and were aware of my case, i had a quick interview and picked up my travel documents. my brother bought a ticket for me to fly to the us directly from istanbul. i had a difficult time getting through airport immigration and had to answer questions for over an hour but in the end everything was fine.

needless to say my parents are very upset with me but they have no control over me anymore. i now need to find a job and see what i can do for going to college. thank you for the advice.",2
"updatefired for being fat. update to: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bx4q0p/fired_for_being_fat_ct/   

i posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. something happened before i could go any further with the lawyer i spoke to.

the monday following the incident i was asked to come speak with a vp of hr i'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. when i walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which i was told was part of legal. what i didn't realize, is my friend who i mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though i told him to keep it secret). this information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. i was asked to explain exactly what happened, who i told, and asked a lot of questions. everything i said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when i told them i was in touch with a lawyer. they had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

this is the holy shit part. they say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt i would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if i wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. they also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. i took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. btw i'm not stupid, i know they did this so i wouldn't take any legal action against them, but i love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. i also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

there's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and i finally have an office with a door i can actually close! i'm in the field a lot less now, so i guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now i don't interact face to face nearly as much as i used

"update iowa city threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors. this is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

hello r/legaladvice,

a few months ago i posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town i live in sent a letter demanding that i take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. most of the comments i received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my first amendment rights, and yes, i should seek a lawyer. 

so i did so. i set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. however, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended i speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

skipping over unnecessary details, i met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. i updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

once i updated the website and the city realized i wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. i went, although now i realize i probably should not have done so. he was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought i should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. he also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think i should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. i declined the interview, because i was afraid i'd get sued (whether justified or not) if i said something the city didn't like.

of course, i was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. so she ran her story, and i was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. what's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. they were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

a few weeks later i received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. it was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. he told me i was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. the letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

this was around mid-january, 2018 (i received the first letter mid-december, 2017). everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until i got an email from the legal director at the aclu of iowa. on the advice of reddit, i had emailed both the aclu and the eff, but after over a month with no response i had figured they were too busy to look at my case. i was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

i spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the aclu of iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. toward the end of february we filed suit in federal court, and by march 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. they had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content i produce regarding the town.
2. they must pay legal damages to me.
3. they must pay attorney fees to the aclu.
4. they must write an apology letter to me.
5. my favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take first amendment training.

all in all, i'm incredibly impressed with the aclu's work on this case. i know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but i think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. i'm super grateful to the aclu for helping me with this, because as i said above, i wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. i'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the aclu -- thank you for all of the help!",2

shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). the firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

"(update) nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

i went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. she took one look at the letter from my friend aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

she contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if i heard more otherwise no need for more action.

aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. he wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. i hadn't complained to them myself so i did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

thanks for the advice in the previous thread, especially /u/wittyandpithy's excellent not-practicing-legal-advice to actually pay to use a legal professional.

"update - dog ate neighbor's drone. *edit: original(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

a small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

i was served a summons by a sheriff's deputy, neighbor decided to take me to small claims over his drone. my mil is a paralegal secretary, so i was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. he seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. he also suggested i counter sue and how i could possibly add in more damages. 

he also told me that my neighbor and i technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under faa regulations. i called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). i don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. they took my information and have called me back once, so i know they're investigating but don't know anything else. not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

i brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos i had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. his main argument to the judge was that i ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which i (somehow) trained him to do"". which, yes i had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so i have somewhere to sit and eat outside. i argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. in the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). he is also banned from flying over my property, and i installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. he seems pretty upset with me, so i wanted to be careful. 

the only thing that could make this better is if the faa finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",2
"doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. i'm 22 and no longer even live with her.. background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. my gp who i have seen since i was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. i moved away for college when i was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new gp and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since i've seen him half my life. 

i get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication i take to make sure that i'm not getting too little/too much. the results of this information or the fact that i have those tests done isn't a big secret i want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless i were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

the first time i had this work done, i hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. they even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/ml the medication level was. again, it's not like to my mother this is anything i want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and i never received any call about my results. i go in for these monthly, so the next month that i went i told the woman working in the lab of the office that i wanted to update my information to make sure i got the results (i thought also since i had been seeing this doctor since i was 10 i probably had never given them my phone number). a few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; i again got no call from the office. once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when i explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, i was a little tipped off that i wasn't called again. i chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

at this visit i had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. he asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. i wasn't worried that i was pregnant, but i knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. i asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. it did, so on my way out i stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that i and i alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. they nonchalantly agreed and i asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. i happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. my mom blew up at me asking why i needed to take a pregnancy test (i didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). that all blew over, but at this point i was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

i ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of hipaa and she knows it after working in a hospital. she laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since i was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - i'm your mom!""

since then, i've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. to no surprise there are no issues. i don't really know what to do here. since i cut ties with that doctor, i no longer have personal problems with this, but i'm sure other people do without even knowing it. i don't have resources really for a lawyer. i might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. so how serious is it really?

"mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that i said i don't want to pay. so my parents are heavily mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if i had paid my tithing i told them no. they then asked me if i had a plan to fix that and i told them that i worked too hard just to give that money away.

anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as i am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

this isn't legal right?

*update: i plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. i will leave some in as to not look suspicious. i will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*update 2: ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. he's stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. my mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. she said she'll give me the rest back and that she's still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. i'm at a loss what to do next.

*update 3: doesn't sound like i'm getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. my mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. my dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them.

"co my retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. i fear that she intends to abuse other children and i want to stop it. i have proof of her abuse against me. how do i go about this?. between the ages of 9-11, i took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. if memory serves, i believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that i took lessons with her. the only reason i stopped going to her was because she retired. 

my teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". i won't get into specifics, but i have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

i never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

recently, i found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. i am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and i want to stop it before it's too late.

so my question is: legally, what can i do and what should my course of action be? i don't want money, i just want her stopped.

i have the photographs, but i am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

please walk me through this, because i genuinely don't know what to do, and i'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because i didn't stop it sooner.

"update neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. now she's trying to sue me. we're the ones with 29k in medical bills. nc usa. here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=jsce6bw3&sh=7f56780f


my sister and i spent the weekend after i posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
the guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
he is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

the neighbors mean dog has been put down.  she was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

we've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

she was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
one from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  i'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

one for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

her lawsuit against me has a court date of march 5th.  after she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   she then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

she finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in nc where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

now for some extra facts. 

my left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on february 27th. 

our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  the vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  she still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

the destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

the day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  she broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  she straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  she also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

we called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. they asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

the video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  it shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. it also shows her audibly laughing during it. she only started trying to help when i started smashing her dog into the ground. 

we also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the hoa. 

he said it's pointless to go after the hoa and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  our lawyer did tell us that the hoa has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

there was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

i honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

either way, my sister and i both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of march. 

thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. you guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

i'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  please feel free to ask any questions and i'll answer whatever i can.

i went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. the owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. the girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said i felt that i needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. my parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs.

i really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn i was wrong. like i said i'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, i didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too. this has been a learning experience for me and i hope that i can become a better person because of it.",2

(texas). its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  one guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  a lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  one lady missed the receipt of a death certificate.  we thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  so i tried calling the usps and that got me nowhere.  going down in person was the only way to do this i guess.  turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal po box?  who knows.  the post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  still, how could this have happened?  surely this can't be legal.  i got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  she hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

edit:  well that was quick~!  the post office called me directly before i could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  they're very certain what she did is illegal.  thanks /u/beamdriver for the advice!  important lesson here kids:  don't fuck with people's mail, because the usps apparently is the most effective law enforcement agency there is.

"can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?. yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and i chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. a plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

the girl tried to say i was trying to steal her phone. i told the officer that i could unlock the phone and the girl could not, i told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

he refused to give me the chance or believe me. he told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

i left. 

the girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so i decided to check back 2 hours later. i saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

when no one was in her store and her back was turned i took my phone back. 

before anyone starts going off on me for it, i know. i know exactly what i did was extremely stupid but i am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

i am asking for the legalities of it.

the phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

the place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that i am on video. my questions are simply did i break any laws?

if the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and i was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did i break the law?

edit: thanks for all of the info. i do not wish to pursue a police complaint nor do i wish to report the crime. i am too lazy for that.

"update girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. i don't. what are my rights? (texas). this is my first post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

short version: i'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

long version:

if you remember, i asked about how i should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. i listened to the suggestions. got a lawyer. put myself on the registry as well.

she really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. i was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. but in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. so we had no messy legal right over it.

the childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. my lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

so i have my baby daughter!

taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. i feel like i have something to live for! my family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. i also got a promotion at work. i realized that i need to be more ambitious because i now have a baby to provide for. a higher position was open at my work and i asked for the promotion but they told me i'm too young. i offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that i can do it. after a month they gave me the job! 

as most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), i had my lawyer file for child support after i had full custody. my ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. she actually called me names and various insults and all of that. but i didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. she said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. i don't know. i didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but i think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. i didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, i'm not good at studying) but i want to make sure my daughter has the chance! my sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and i think i'll send most of the child support payments there once i start receiving them.

thank you all. ",2
"husband surprised me with a divorce, cleaned out bank accounts and shut off credit cards. how can i find an attorney with no money?. tonight when my husband got home from work he informed me he wants a divorce and will be leaving until it's done. this is not a huge surprise honestly, ever since our daughter was born we've just not been getting along. what is a surprise is it's suddenness.

i've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what i made on day-care.

so in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""good luck with the mortgage and bills, i've taken my money out of our bank account and turned off your card on my credit"". i would say i was shocked, but i really am not. he's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

i obviously need an attorney, i logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. what resources can i begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until i can find childcare and a job? is there anything i can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? i understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. i don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

i'm in wisconsin, i've tried to google up the best could since the little one went to sleep but i can't find what i'm looking for or even really know what i'm looking for. thanks for anyone who helps",2
"update. my parents joined a new age cult and tried to drag me to a compound against my will.. since my last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) got popular and people still seem interested in my situation i thought i would give you guys a update on everything. it's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till i felt ready. well, now that i'm settled down a bit i feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says i should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though i know the group now i won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).

&#x200b;

so after i stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. my dad said not to go so i somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and i would come home that night. this plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. it didn't take long before my mom caught on that i was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  my mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because i had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. my friends parents called the police and i called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. i'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200b;

my mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. in the end my dad made it so i would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. i stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. my mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: my step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month i was coming no matter what. 

&#x200b;

after a week of this, everything changed. my mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. my sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. during this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  after this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200b;

she proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". all to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand i was being used by evil.""during these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn i was."" according to her i am a ""evil seed"" and that i not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". i also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. she told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. she ended by telling me that i was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". the last contact i know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

&#x200b;

at the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. i moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. things are still pretty raw right now and i really don't feel like getting into the emotions i feel towards this. but i feel like at least updating this may be a start. thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. i really do appreciate it :)",2
"on i caught my neighbors son stealing my underwear/other things. family refuses to believe me or my landlord, and is threatening to sue me for slander. what can i do? - update. my original post is here: here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ayhlsu/on_i_caught_my_neighbors_son_stealing_my/)

thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

a long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. no one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. i told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). so the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

i am satisfied i guess, the entire situation seems extremely uncomfortable and akward. ",2
"dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. how do i protect myself legally?. i have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. a few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

the last few months have been hell. they have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. they are loud way past our community quiet hours. they have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). i have recorded it. it wakes up my 2 year old. do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

they leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. it has ruined my outdoor rug. i took pictures. 

they drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

they regularly park in the reserved spot i pay for monthly. it is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. they are an extra $50 a month. the minute i leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until i threaten to involve the apt. manager.

they have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

they like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. i have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. it ruined my potted plants outside. 

i have reported all the incidents. i have tried to ask them to cut it out. they don't care. 

i recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out i am not the first to complain that day. the police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (i am not sure of how it was found. i stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

since then they have taken to recording me any time i leave my apartment. they have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

the woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how i am impeding her ability to exist in public because i am racist. she says i call the police on her for doing nothing. i only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

i understand i am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. i would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

i just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot i pay for monthly, and play loud music i can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

she had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

they have really upped the bleach game too. it has gotten on a few spots on my door and i am scared they might throw it at my car. 

i have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. i can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

i can't lose my job and i am not sure how protect myself legally. 

they are actually my paid space right now but i am scared to have them towed because i don't know what they are going to do. i pay for that space. i have proof. the sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

if i tell the apartment they will have the car towed but i'll look like a racist. 

all it takes is one video and a lie and i am ruined. 

i want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but i think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that i pay for is reasonable. but maybe not?",2
"boyfriend and i slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out. this happened in ontario, canada.

so this past friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

i found out about it the next night at work (i work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and i were the night before. he filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

for more context, on the 24th of october a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. it has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (i sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

all we asked for was the alarm for our unit. luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

i dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. my dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. but i don't know. came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in ontario. 

edit: more direct questions; should we pursue action and report? if we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? i know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. i could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

tldr: boyfriend and i were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

"caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result. i went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while i was away. i came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. my oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. i thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. took her to the icu and the doctor ran a lot of tests. the doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. she was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. this caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. she suffered for two days in the icu before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. there was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. i stayed by her side as they euthanized her. that was about 3 days ago. my heart is in pieces. 
there is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. but i have text messages of when i tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

i know i'm angry and grieving. but because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until i had to let her go.

"son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.. this has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. we sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. his allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

we had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. we even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

so we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and i can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. he continued to adamantly deny doing that and said mrs gave them to him. 

we then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? he's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""do not worry! this won't happen again"". we have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

then, the very next school day (the meeting was on friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. we figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. we send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. we get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? he should have known to ask to begin with. we are teachers not parents.""

we have no issues for a while until this week. some parent brought in pb&j sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. he forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". we find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. he was not given this one. we spent a day at the hospital.

we've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? the school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. he gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. this is in indiana, any help is appreciated.",2
"neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. update: i'll be sure to post updates so please stop pming me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting i shit-bomb them back. 

my wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. in the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. updates forthcoming.

original post:
hey all, i have a shitty situation here that i'm hoping to get some advice about. this is in idaho.

&#x200b;

my neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. a new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. a few weeks back, i was working in the garage when i saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. he let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. he didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. now, my wife and i have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. my wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so i asked her if there are more piles than normal. sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. she figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. i figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200b;

it happened again around a week later: i was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. this time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. i called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  i went across the street and knocked on his door. he didn't answer. we set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and i kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so i could talk to him.

&#x200b;

i reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. why our yard? no clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. the next time i saw him walking to his car, i confronted him. i simply told him that i knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if i caught him doing it again i'd call the police to report him for trespassing. he denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200b;

so i review the footage from the last few days. dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. he then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. what the absolute fuck.

&#x200b;

how do i even begin handling this?",2
"(update) nebraska i just closed on a new house, sellers allege that i owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because i did not take over their contract. threatening small claims court.. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. this was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


so, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. this was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. i've never been a big talker, but i honestly don't think i was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. the judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so i could speak my side fully. she absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so i could say that i never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that i did.


the judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. i thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. so now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


during this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. the seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while i was at work to tell me he was very displeased i filed a formal complaint against his realtor. he told me i was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and i assured him the feeling was mutual. the broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. so i went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. the mayor asked me what i wanted out of this, and i showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him i felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. the mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (this is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


i never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. so now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. the new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. long story short, there was not. the judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


it's been five days and no word on an appeal so i think it's safe to say i'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. i'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


on a final note, gossip, but i got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (the mayor and i know each other well). so i went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. we got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. i didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. kind of cathartic.


tl;dr: they lost and i think it's finally over.

edit: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! to clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. yes, i could probably countersue, but i'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

please do not take this post as a representation of nebraska, most people here are actually quite nice. there's a couple rotten apples in every bunch.",2
"police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while i was asleep. this has been a really weird morning... not sure if i chose the correct flair

i have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. he sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. i put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. around 3am i got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. she gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

at 6:30am i am awoken by a single low knocking sound. i get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point i usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more z's). as i exit my room i am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. i dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if i should serve them a drink. one cop asks me who i am to which i reply with my full name and ask what is going on. he continues his interrogation, asking if i live with a woman. fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. i answer that i live with my girlfriend. the cop asks me if i have a son to which i reply yes. he asks me where he is. at this point i lean over the wall and i see my door busted upen. i am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so i look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. i see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" the tell me to step out into the dining room and i put my hands up as i walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. i sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. i look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex i live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 the cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. he says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. he claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. they never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. my apartment has weird acoustics and i cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

he asks me why i didnt hear him and i told him i must have been deeply asleep. he asks if i am under the influence of drugs and i say i just went to bed late because i was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. as the cops leave i could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. the cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. i asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. i asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

so now i am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. i fear when i go outside i'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

i have been trying to understand the timeline of events. i went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. if the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. my son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. the cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" not a crying child. my son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? what about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? was that just an excuse to burst in? he sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

his car was already a mess when he arrived. we would be late to the ball drop if we had chosen another ride. we were in the car for 6 minutes and had a nice conversation. 24 hours later i was charged $100. what can or should i do?

update: lyft has informed me that the evidence the driver gave was enough to close the claim indefinitely. also, the last email that they sent me said that my driver ""roy"" (not my driver) filed the claim promptly.... who the fuck is roy and where is my fucking money! 

looking in to get the info behind the photos. still no reply from lyft. used my debit card and the bank said they may be able to challenge the charge.

"update: landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. good news!. well, here's my update! and with good news!

so first of all, i just wanted to say: wow. the amount of support i received, both in replies and in pms, was absolutely amazing. everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. the person who said ""sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

that said - i feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). he's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. he grew up in rural (arkansas, i think? that or alabama) and came to ma later in life. this was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. that, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

i know some of you were hoping i'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, i decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

yesterday i sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. he realized very quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. he also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. he just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

we ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if i weren't having the conversation with him i'd think he were a caricature). he's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so i think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". he seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. i reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

he still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. he seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. he agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which i will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

the past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. if things go well, i might even potentially renew the lease come september. i'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but i think i'll leave the issue where it lies for now. if this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, i'll go at him with everything i can in the future - but for now i'm satisfied. i'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",2
"mn a girl is planning to claim i am the father of her baby when we never had sex. i've been living in a foster home since january '18. i turn 15 in march. the foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. she blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. i never had sex with her, and i would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. the foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

i can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. i said i would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks i will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. she is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her.",2
"nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. long time la reader here, and i'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. when i'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

early in november we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend i'll call aaron (because his name's aaron and i think he's being an idiot) had bought on ebay. we had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

it'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. i'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. there was no way i'd go through the water as it looked, but because i'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river i didn't want to risk it. i didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. i said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

aaron decided to push on and started moving and i panicked and got straight out. it was far more water than i'd had to go through when i near lost my car and life before. i got out well before the water though so i didn't let water in the car btw.

aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. he was extremely lucky not to drown, and i ran down & helped him out. immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. admittedly i'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of ebay parts in the back so it's not like i'd have made much difference.

we phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. we haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. but on friday i received a letter from a lawyer i know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. it's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because i made the car unsafe by getting out. it was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

i think he's being a dickhead. someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? ideally i'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what i think they'll be. i want to contact his lawyer to tell them aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should i get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

"update - mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

i promised an update so here it is. first off, i want to thank everyone who strongly suggested i go see a doctor asap. i went to see an ent and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. my hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. the tinnitus was still quite bad, so i wanted to see if the doc could help with that. he put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. i saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (this was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

the ringing has gone down considerably, and i'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. it still bothers me at night and while i'm trying to work sometimes. the biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so i haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. this has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point i'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

my uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. i'm not planning on suing him. he knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what i was going through. my aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. i haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. they have offered to call me and apologize but i don't want to talk to them. i just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. i'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but i don't care. fuck that guy. thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",2

update 2: aa called me, apologized for the fa ""escalating out of control"". they will open an internal investigation. i conveyed that i don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 but that it's up to aa to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. i don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

she assured me that i won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me.

for those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - i'm a 120lb girl lol. i injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. it's just that i talked back (""no i don't but okay"") and i regret that so much. 

halloween is over but she spooked me to the core.

update 1: thank you so much for your quick advice on a sunday morning! i memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

as we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""the police will contact you when you get home. you will be banned from future flights."" 

""ok."" 

""oh i hope so."" as she walked away. 

i burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. she won. 

there was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my miranda rights. i made it home in one piece. still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future aa flights. i've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. my thanksgiving and holiday flights are both on aa. 

my seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. they gave me their business card in case i need a witness. 

thank you again for your helpful comments. i am not in jail (yet) at least!

original post: 

i can't believe this is happening to me. i'm flying from chicago to boston now and police are waiting for me when i land, so i don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

edit: i've looked all over the internet and can't find any faa rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

here's what happened:

..

i was on an american airlines flight from chicago to boston on november 3rd, 2019. because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, i use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. this sling is often advertised on facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. i am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""you have to put your feet on the ground!"" i cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""no i don't but okay."" as i put my feet down. emphasizing again. **i complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** although i had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights i've taken with my foot sling, i complied. i put my feet down immediately. 

even if it's technically not allowed by some rule i'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

she immediately escalated: 
""would you like to go back to the gate? we're gonna go back to the gate!"" and immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

but right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

she came back to my seat and barked: 
""police will be waiting for you when we land in boston.""

my seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. i had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no i don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

her statement caused me to panic inside. i'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

so i took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight.

"my niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.. located in oklahoma, usa

my sister and i have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. my niece told my sister about it when she got home. my sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. so they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

the principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. the only thing i can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? they risked my niece's safety and i think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but i'm not sure what could be done.

update: my sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. the board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. the school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. thank you to the people who were helpful!",2

i contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. he seemed to agree that something was very fishy. to make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with dcs. 

i'm still in complete shock.

we went straight to the police. they're taking this very seriously. i can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. i never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. i feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

i haven't had the baby yet. we're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. my ob and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. i'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

"returned a $1,175 computer back to walmart and they refuse to refund the money.. hi all! so i put a gaming comp on layaway with walmart a few weeks ago so i could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. 

i finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. so i returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as i was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. 

well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

we did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn't good enough?? she said that it had a ""different balance"" on all the receipts but that's because it was layaway and i made payments! 

she told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof?

"my daughter left daycare and ran into the street and nobody noticed until a stranger found her. (wi) just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago.

i jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (i have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

i drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

i was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a good samaritan that i just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her.

my boss went home and called me two hours into my shift to tell me my relief would not be showing and that he couldn't find a replacement. 

i told him i could either work overnight or pull a 12 tomorrow, but i cannot work 32 hours straight and safely drive home. 

i also have a medical condition i need to take medication for and a missed dose will give me debilitating withdrawal symptoms. 


my boss informed me that he was going to bed and would be turning off his phone. 


it's 11:30pm and i've tried contacting everyone up the chain. nobody has so much as an estimate as to when i can go home- they're all asleep or punting the problem to someone else (who is asleep). 

if i leave, i'll be fired. if i fall asleep, i'll be fired. 

what's my best move?

(edited for spacing)

edit: it turns out what my bosses are doing isn't illegal but i seriously doubt they'll fire me when it means they'll be down three workers instead of two. 

i've informed the only person i can reach (my direct supervisor) that i'll be leaving at a set time, whether they've found a replacement or not.

second edit: i got my supervisors spoken permission to go home and take my meds/eat, and unspoken permission to curl up on the dirty floor someplace off camera to sleep. 

job hunt starts tomorrow. 

thank you everyone for your help.

final edit: i'm home and i've slept, had a good meal and taken my meds. my next shift isn't for a couple days. 

i'm completely overwhelmed. thank you everyone so much for your support. 

i'm going to be speaking with my family's lawyer about what we can do. 

the medication i'm taking is not methadone or suboxone, but best wishes to everyone who dmed me looking for solidarity in fighting that battle. i have close family members struggling with addiction as well and it's one of the hardest things anyone can do. 

please please please stop dming me to ask who i work for and where i'm working- i understand the concern but i don't want to dox myself more than i already have.",2
"exwife is going off the deep end. this is in nj, usa. can i do anything here?. i get my daughter every other weekend. she's 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

this weekend, we were watching a movie when i got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

now, i don't attach myself to my phone (unless i'm working) and i got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

when i saw it, i told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and i also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that i told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

the movie ended around 9:10 pm and i had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. i told her i'd be up to tuck her in. 

i went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

he mother was screaming into the phone ""you tell him fuck you! you can say that! i say its ok for you to tell your father fuck you!!""

i took the phone from my daughter and i said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

she yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

i asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. my ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

i handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was saturday night so i bent the bedtime a bit). 

i had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

i walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""i'm sorry"" into the phone. i fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

i walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

it wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. she had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

i sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. she was really upset and wouldn't speak much. i hugged her. my daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

i'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. divorce is hard enough on children, and i think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be. 

what can i do?",2
"update: hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (to, canada). link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

first i want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and i are quite happy with. i've been very active on reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. it has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. i digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

through the advice i received on this subreddit, i contacted the city and the health department right away. i was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. the more we spoke the more interested he became. he called and asked me ""if i were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would i be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" to which i replied ""150%"". he then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, i said ""no."" 

shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. i went out and asked them why. they told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. i told them they were to leave it there as i have called the city and they are on their way. they didn't seem happy. as if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. i also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. i have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. this lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

i explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. according to toronto health and bylaws that is bullshit. the situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. the bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information i have been receiving from the building management. 

the bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. i heard nothing until monday. come monday morning i get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. they will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. the cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. i'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

the city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. i do not believe them at all. we have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. from what i understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. i have the personal contact information for the officer i spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. we went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

thank you so much reddit!!! i couldn't have done it without your help!! 

here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. ",2
"police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him. this happened last week, he's only 11. at around 10am my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

they then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. the biggest issue is no one called us. not the school, not the police no one. we got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1pm).

we called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. we start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iphone and seen where he was and we headed there.

we got there at maybe 1:15pm and were completely stonewalled. no one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. he spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing nerf guns (this is important later).

we continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. she wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30pm and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7pm. they did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

we get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. they never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""creepers"" from their minecraft game. they painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

when they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. we've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

they kept offering him mcdonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. they asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. they kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

the school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. we can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. what the hell do we do?

edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",2
"ne & co my mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. can she do that?. for some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. she has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since i've moved out for college. she demands access to absolutely everything i have. this will be important later.

&#x200b;

i'm 18 years old, and i'm a college freshman. i go to college in colorado, but i was born and raised in nebraska. in nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. it was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. like i said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when i do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200b;

my mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. email, whatsapp, facebook (even though i haven't used it in years), twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if i don't give it to her. in the past, i've rolled over and taken it. it was a survival mechanism more than anything. if i'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. she justifies this by claiming that because i have autism, i can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200b;

about a month ago, i changed all my passwords. sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that i need to give her my new passwords. i tell her no. this is where trouble begins.

&#x200b;

over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. she's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. a week ago, she showed up here and i had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. that pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200b;

recently, though, as in last night, i was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" i asked her to clarify and she said that because i'm still a minor in nebraska, and i'm a resident of nebraska, i have to abide by nebraska's laws and as such, i am still a minor and she can do that. i wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like i wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as i've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. it's not nice. i do not want to be gooned and taken home. i don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200b;

so the question is this: can she do that? is the fugitive slave act not dead after all? does my having autism change the circumstances any? if all else fails, what can i do to protect myself?",2
"(va) my son stole a rare toy from my brother. my brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. what do i do?. right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. here is the story.

&#x200b;

last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. while we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. my brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what i know it's one of his biggest hobbies. well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200b;

well, until yesterday. my brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and i needed to return it immediately. i honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a boba fett figure from his collection. he confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200b;

i was furious and took it from him. here is the problem though, after i confirmed with my brother it was his i found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. so my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. i told him i would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200b;

honestly, what are my options here? i can't afford to pay him back right now. if he does go the police will my son get arrested? he's only 15. it was very wrong of him to do but i think my brother is over reacting. what can i expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",2
"(ohio) woman sent me video of her setting my priceless painting (family heirloom) on fire because i called cps on her. my boyfriend's sister in law abuses and over medicated her autistic child so i called child protective services on her months ago. i was living up there near his family and long story short, when i drove home for the holidays (was just supposed to be a short trip but all hell broke loose and my boyfriend quickly packed everything we owned and followed me down a few days later) he forgot this one painting that has been in the family for over 100 years and my grandfather gave it to me before he died 14 years ago. she and her husband sent me a video saying ""this is for calling cps, bitch."" they're both clearly seen in the video and called it a priceless painting. 

do i have any ground to sue or press charges? i wanted to see if anyone here might have advice before i go and shell out my savings for a lawyer. this was literally my most prized possession and my heart is in so many pieces because my grandfather gave it to me so long ago. i would give everything i own just to get it back. i'm living in florida and this is all in ohio.

"bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because i dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?. i have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way i dress. my neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

about a month ago, i moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. i didn't expect any trouble. my first introduction to this woman, let's call her karen, was my first week here. i went to check the mail and i wasn't wearing a bra. i had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. karen is one of *those* southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. you know the type. she waved at me and i waved back, trying to be pleasant. she came at me, i thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

it was creepy and weird. i am not at all well endowed, i go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not karen. karen urged me to think of her children and jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. it was so goddamn weird, i felt like laughing in her face, but i didn't want there to be issues so i said i'd be more diligent in the future and karen went about her business.

well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for karen, y'all, oh no. not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. while my breasts are small and humble, i am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

the second time karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. she threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated i got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a jezebel and that i needed jesus. because i was wearing jean shorts.

we live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and i like to go out for walks, but it seems every time i step foot out of my door, there's fucking karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. it's getting annoying. 

this is in florida, by the way.

edit: i got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (i do not regularly dress like this) i must have been quite a sight to karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. she started laying into me. i just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then i said ""you can stop the games, karen. i see the way you look at me, i know you want me."" her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""i'll pray for you."" then scurried away. actually went inside her house. 😂",2

"my mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600v. the doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. it put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.. location: us. original incident happened in indiana.

i should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point i doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

when i was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. she thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. this led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. it turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

it could be some form of ptsd i suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. she told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

"a male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. he just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.. spa is in maryland. a friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. he is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. he has not spoken with management yet. he just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

minor update: i advised him of his many options after reading the comments. he went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

i'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. the mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

thank you everyone for the comments. if this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. ",2
"new york- mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while i was babysitting 4 year old step sister. hi folks

i'm a 21 year old college student. my parents separated soon after i was born, and my my mom raised me alone until i was 15. she met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister eliza. she's grown up with me, and i often baby sit for her for short periods of time. i live with a roomate in apartments owned by the college

late last week, my stepfather's mom died. he's polish, so my mom and he left for poland leaving me to babysit eliza for a week. yesterday, i got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in poland. i've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

i have no idea what to do. my biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. my mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the usa that i am aware of. i'm studying political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but i have no job and no salary. 

eliza has no family other than me that i can turn to. i'm not ready to take of a child, but i also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and i've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. but we also look very different- my dad is jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. so i'm a tall, mixed race dude while eliza is a small blonde girl (i bring this up because i was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

so what do i do? i'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and i haven't even told eliza yet. it just hit me that we're now alone, and i now have to step up to the plate and take care of eliza. i have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

edit: thank you for all you advice. i apologize if i do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. however, i am currently ok, and my mom's friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and i also have a little bit saved up. but i greatly appreciate your generosity",2
"my daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (washington). on a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  she says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  so far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

we talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  this has not helped.  we escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

the principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  the read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  the principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

"us, ok disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.. to give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. there aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

i have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. by some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. for the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

the family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. from the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. these are very powerful, very fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

we've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. we've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. they have to be picked up on the street.

the conversation was polite until she said she was unable to pay me and might was able to pay me in a different way (which i think nudes and  i am under age).
she told me she would fuck me up and i didn't take it serious,  just had a good laugh out of it and posted it on reddit (post(https://www.reddit.com/r/choosingbeggars/comments/au7ygj/sure_ill_make_a_logo_that_i_have_to_work_3_hour/?st=jsjae8gg&sh=35d7b55d)

i blocked her, but an hour ago she made a new account and contacted me again saying she would sue me if i didn't delete the post.
is it possible for her to sue me? i removed all information that could tell it was that person (instagram name and picture).

could she still sue me for any reason?
i am just 15, so i am a little scared.
i am in the netherlands.",2
"(update) school wants my son's facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. wtf? florida. this is an update to this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

i went to school and asked what's going on. i did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

first, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. second, the principal explained the situation to me. it had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

when i asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. i asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

i told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. i told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat i'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

i talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. he only knew that she had left the school. he showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

in short: they backed off after i made sure they understood that i won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. i will try talking to them to make sure. they deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at.

"update: old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues i'm having."" found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (mn). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200b;

**old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that i was having a ton of issues. i found out my therapist is her husband, but i didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200b;

**new developments summary**: there's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. i even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200b;

**new developments, continued**: therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). i have a very peculiar family dynamic, so i think he talked about that. however, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that i was depressed and had family issues. neat. one of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200b;

**resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than i thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. i don't know if he'll practice again.

&#x200b;

***thank you all -*** you were a huge help, and a confidence boost that me complaining about this would actually get it somewhere and not just create more stress in my life. it's apparently led to a ton of drama at my old workplace, which has been sort of pleasant to hear updates about from afar. glad to not be there anymore. i also found a new therapist who's great, and she's really helped validate that the old guy (and his wife) was one bag egg in a sea of otherwise well-meaning people.",2
"i suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. i managed to procure specimen in question. what do i do now?. not sure if this is the right subreddit. sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and i don't know what to do. let me break down some background first:

&#x200b;

my dad is currently dying of liver failure. he's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  we have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. the man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. he's taking light doses of morphine and lorazepam so that he can sleep. the consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to thanksgiving....

&#x200b;

my step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  there was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (my dad would be the 5th man)

she's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. not through any vet or other official. she is barred from every animal shelter and adoption agency in the state as a result.

so with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200b;

she brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. he was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. in a matter of less than a minute after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction i've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. before i even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""do you see the light yet??? do you see all the pretty angels??"" (wtf????). he's been in an essentially catatonic state since. out cold for the past 12 hours. it was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. in tears, i begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. i was truly scared and genuinely thought i was going to lose him right then and there. we called hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. they are on staff 24/7). she wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

but he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and nothing like this has ever happened. i'm just a lay person, but that did not seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened immediately following the food, like flipping a light switch.

maybe i'm crazy. maybe i'm reading too much into it.  but i managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. my first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? is that even a thing? do i take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? a hospital?

with him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200b;

again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, i probably wouldn't think anything of it....

&#x200b;

any and all feedback would be much appreciated. i'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",2
"minnesota: landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. what now?. for some background i am renting an apartment and my lease ends on september 30th. my landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. i do have a lease that says i get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which i believe is the law itself, but in this case i did not get that notice.

last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8am saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). he asked if i could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing i'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

i did not see these messages until i took lunch at 12. i texted my landlord back saying i thought i am supposed to get notice for entry and i'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though i'm sure that doesn't legally count).

long story short they robbed me and i have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. they took everything of value such as laptop and tv and even some stupid things like my lamps.

my renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and i should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. he met them at dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. i told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place i would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

what now? push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? i would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",2
"wi my girlfriend's landlord just entered her house when he thought nobody was home.. my girlfriends landlord entered her house after he talked to her as she was going to work. he believed nobody to. be home, but i was here laying in bed. i woke up to him coming into the apartment to use the bathroom and then leaving. when i said something as he was leaving he ignored me. i text my girlfriend about it to see if she had given him permission to enter and she said no. he did have permission to enter the building at 11 am to show her apartment, but this was at 9:30 am and he had no tenant to sho the apartment to. he just came in, used the bathroom and left. he didn't even finish flushing the toilet. 

when i confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. he then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. and when i explained to him that i had every right to be there because i had permission from the tenant to be there, he said ""okay, i'll let you go this time."" 

my girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. how can we make sure he doesn't do this again? 

also, the dude didn't even finish flushing the toilet and left a turd in it.

edit 2: there was an empty unit across the hall.",2
"update: i am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. my step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. can someone help me please?. i posted this a few weeks ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i\_am\_supposed\_to\_have\_money\_put\_aside\_for\_me\_for/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i_am_supposed_to_have_money_put_aside_for_me_for/)

i just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). i was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

he was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. one of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

he gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

i also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* they both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. they aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. with her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. so now she is paying her way. 

anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

thank you so much for your help.",2
"update ga just moved into a condo, neighbor is raising hell over my nonexistent pet bird.  original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8chp37/ga_just_moved_into_a_condo_neighbor_is_tasing/)

tl;dr of previous post\- my next door neighbor is absolutely convinced i have a pet bird and has made complaints to the hoa, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

i got another complaint from the head guy running the hoa that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. the wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. however, the beeping is coming from their unit, as i can faintly hear it if i press my ear to the shared wall. and the birds that are supposedly my pets? the ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? those are the birds outside. it's literally the chirping of the birds outside they're hearing. now, i'm no disney princess, so i have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. i mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  and i'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

i've sent a letter to the hoa telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that i have no control over. i'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say i have birds again i can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  i'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the hoa covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

now i'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because i don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",2
"update this man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, i have a specific question regarding something i want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.. i would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). sorry for not updating you right away as i was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

so here's what happened. i liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. so i hired a guy which i'll call him frank.

after waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

a few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom i recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. we went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. shockingly he was completely understanding. he told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both frank and i a settlement if i agree not to sue. i called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed frank for his drone plus way more money that i would've ever paid him. he also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that i wont pursue any legal action.

it was a happy ending and i was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but i must admit that i feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. never have i felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. while we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! so the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and i'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",2
"tsa detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the er and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.. i'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

my father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a port(https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/cdr756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  we came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (new york) facing the customer directly at our shop. they sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. i'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. however, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

today, they were flying from tn (i don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to houston, tx, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   he had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (brooklyn, ny) and in texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which i will request from his doctors tomorrow)  he also brings a printout from the tsa about traveling with a port and cancer which i will find the exact link to when i get more info.  

my parents arrive 3:45 to a tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
both parents have tsa pre and get on line at about 4. they are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  the agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the id, etc.  my father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. meanwhile i assume he is not speaking his best english, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. i'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which i think adds to the confusion. they wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. they don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  they go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   my father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  he calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  he tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (his first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) they take him into a small room away from my mother. he is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  the agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. the agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  my father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  i have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. he couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

he tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) the agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   the agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. my father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  they bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  they wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  they agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  they take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. he asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. by this point the plane has left.  they go to the er to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

he has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  my father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  port is ok but they want to check him out again before flying.

i would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. if he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? they have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. i am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so i have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that i can go over with her later, so i'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
my family is very quiet, i don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  i would if that is the only option, however.  i don't know if it's relevant that we are muslim, either, i assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  my father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  he doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  i would love some advice.  apologies for length.

"i think my dads company is responsible for his death california. my dad passed away last week while at work. he had a massive heart attack. he was in the bathroom while the attack happened and he tried calling 911 repeatedly. here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet. 

the doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so i'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived. 

i spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. is that true? i'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, i can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere. ",2
"today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. the mystery fence(https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nqdq)

delaware, usa. no homeowners association.

we live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. it's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. there was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). i removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

well i come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. the leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

i don't know who owns it, so i called the real estate agent. he was just as shocked as i was when i told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. he had no idea. he'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. i asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. she didn't.

our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. so he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which i thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

he spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. during this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

so our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. the lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

now i can't go into a lot of the details but i can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. i just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. we are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",2
"tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

i own an apartment in downtown toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with airbnb tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until january.

i decided to list my place up for a rental in late august, for rental until janaury. since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). i immediately got a hit by a person named jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.she signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""no short term rentals, through services such as airbnb"".

yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* on monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. along with a strong smell of pot. they apparently identified themselves as airbnb renters. (apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through airbnb).
* i am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* i am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

after getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on airbnb, using very recent photos of my apartment. i tried to contact jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

i have tried numerous times to talk to airbnb, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*edit\* i forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. i want to stop randoms from airbnb from entering my apartment now. ",2
"update: i just recieved a demand letter from enterprise rent-a-car stating that if i do not return their rental car, i will be charged with embezzlement and grand theft auto. i never rented a car from them. (san jose, california). thank you to everyone for the advice. i'm also a she by the way (many of you thought i was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

after my initial post, i saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because enterprise is the one at fault and i shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. so i did exactly this, and she told me that id i want her to give me more info, i would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that i am not the person who rented the car.  if not, she would report me for embezzlement and grand theft to the sacramento police. upon hearing this, i decided to file a report immediately online with the san jose police department. i know many of you said i shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, i did not want to take any chances where i could end up with a warrant on my head.  i thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  after filing it, i emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  when i spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that i was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

on may 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. she showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had my information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with cash. (i thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) the manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the sacramento police later that afternoon. the following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as fraud, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  at this point, i was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. i then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to sacramento see who the hell this woman is. however, turns out i didn't have to because 2 hours later...  
  
  
  
the san jose police did show up knocking on my front door. ( 2 policemen and 2 chp officers) before opening it, the first thing i did was grab the copy of the police report i printed because i seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). when i open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if name of woman i do not know lives at my home? i tell them no, and that i have no idea who that is,  then they ask if i am alymg and i tell them that i am. they then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of fremont that morning. the accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. they then show the license to me and it's an exact replica of my drivers license, and i ask them how this is possible if i have my license in my wallet? they then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (the black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) i then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when i hand them my report. i explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from enterprise.  so basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. i told the officers that i have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. i then asked them who is the name of the woman i do not know and they told me that she is the who stole the car. however, i'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we do not look a-like at all. idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. but after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

i do have her name now though, and after doing a google search i found her facebook and other social media accounts. i'm very tempted to message her but i've decided to leave this to the police because i have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she does know where i live) however, i do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

"girlfriend was arrested w/ a dui but blew a .06!!! cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!. so..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. she didn't drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. when the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). on her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. a minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. she admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

this is when it gets interesting. 

the officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. he then declared that she was drunk without having her blow to test her bac, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

then, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! that's below the legal limit (we are in wyoming). and the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her bac was. 

my question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? we have no money and probably can't afford a good lawyer. i could barely afford her bail. she is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn't deter her from pursuing her dream. 

any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. we have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn't tell her the miranda rights (found out he doesn't need to)


edit: thank you all so much for the help

edit: i am against drunk and unsafe driving (and so is my gf). in this situation she believed that she was good to drive and would not harm anyone. it was a shitty situation all around and she wishes that she had just walked or taken an uber.

"my parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. i am sick of this shit (florida). for clarity we're both minors. i'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. she has never been right since we were little kids. always violent. she bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when i was 5 because i wouldn't let her ride my bike. all of my life i've been putting up with this shit and i have had enough.

she hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. my parents wont do anything about it. she's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. i really don't know what is wrong with her. she's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. my parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. they refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". which brings us to today. my parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. whatever, not important.

anyway, i was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. we decided to go to the dollar tree to get some snacks. demon didn't buy anything. as we left the store i could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. i confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! i don't know why. don't they make meth out of those or something? so i told her i was going to call mom. i pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! i was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was i going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. i took her down and had her pinned on the ground. that's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will not stop otherwise. i had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. she got me in the throat and i was letting her go! i was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

it took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. it hurts like a bitch. my friend gave me a bunch of tylenol and it still hurts. i came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *i* do to upset her?! i was so angry i told them i was calling the cops and my dad told me i couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! is that true??? 

something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and i'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  please help me. 

update: well shit went down basically how i expected it would. my mom called me very upset that police had came. what happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. i asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her baker acted because i was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and i guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. my mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. she said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved.

"the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action tx. when i was 14, i was raped by a close family friend. i got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when i was 15. i knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but i did not know their names or what they were like. we received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. i do not remember signing anything.  i do not know what happened to the friend; i asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. my mother said he was jailed but i don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. i  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. my husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200b;

a month ago, i received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. i believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. she told me that she wanted to get to know me. i spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. i found myself disgusted by her. there are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. she is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. i decided that i would not be comfortable meeting her. i blocked her without responding. after a week, i began to receive letters from her. four letters in total. i did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. i finally answered. i told her that i was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or i would get the police involved.

&#x200b;

she  began to berate me. she told me  that my family was her family. she accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that i had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that i had held back important information. without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  she told me that she would be making contact with my family whether i liked it or not. she also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if i did not comply and that i could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. when i began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. if i agreed to pay for a round of ivf, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. here are my questions:

&#x200b;

1. does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if i tell her to stay away?
2. could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. my parents are dead and i do not know how to find out information about the adoption. i did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. i am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. could i be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. i have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. could i form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if i agreed to pay?

edit: amount asked for was removed. also, because several people have asked: i do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. it only stopped once i left the state. i am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and i will need to move again.

"pa update: my ex has nude photos of me and threatens to send them to my current partner - can i do anything?. second update: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7vi2zk/pa_update_2_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


my post was not hugely popular, but i have a small update. thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, i read all of them, even the ones i didn't reply to immediately.

i called the police last night. an officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""yeah that's illegal and i don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" he had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. he took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information i have on his girlfriend. 

my ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his po today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. he'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. he also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

he is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the da's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. i'm not clear on the details exactly, i just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

additionally, i am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. she is an rn, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. i don't know how it would impact her license as an rn, but i did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. the officer confirmed this, as well. 

and i took everyone's advice - i contacted my attorney. he is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. he is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

thank you everyone, i have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. my current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. he also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. it's just finally a charge in pa!",2
"my brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. what actions should i take against him?. hello. i'm a first-time poster, and i'm also on mobile. i am 19, and i currently live in new york city.

my parents died when my brothers and i were young (eldest was 11, second (the brother in question) was 7, and i was 5). they left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. i turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. it was in march 2019 that i finally got it. it turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. i decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. i wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. i called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after i deposited the money. my savings account has also been taken from. i'll admit, i really should have been paying more attention, but i was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and i got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. we tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. he had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

when i confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. he spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. i know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. it's just line after line of uber eats, postmates, and game purchases. my grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. it would take years for him to make that money back on minimum wage. should i call the police and have him arrested? is there any way to get that money back?


edit: okay, i've decided to call the police and sue the bank. i know how to get my hands on bank statements, and i'll record him confessing to the theft. but i don't know how to hire a lawyer. where do i start?

edit #2: okay i just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. my grandma sends him to the store with her atm card sometimes to get money. he memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

edit #3: thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. i got a ton of messages and i'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

i've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. we're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. haven't gotten him arrested yet, but i told her if need be, i would call them myself.

i like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. my mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. she explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. she had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an atm.

edit #4: so i went to the bank. because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. no case to sue the bank with. there's nothing i can do to get the money back. i'm ruined financially. all i can do is sue him and put him in jail, but i'm never gonna see that money again. i'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and i'm sorry if i haven't responded to your messages yet. also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. this will be the last edit i make, hopefully.",2

"update texas my mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. however, the police is still alive, and when i showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. how can i get my cat back?. link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

hello,

first off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. i didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so i took one users advice to talk to the director of animal control in my mom's city.

she basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. she said that the only thing i can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. she said the police will understand what to do if a i reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

i went to the police station and the police threw me around again. despite i tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. after 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

the cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, i can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

we get to my mom's house and she's not there. we look around the outside of her house and find no signs of kitty either. i call her and ask her where she is, and told her that i was at her house with the police. she said, in quote, ""i took the cat and ran off into oklahoma and i'm not ever coming back."" 

the police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in oklahoma. 

i went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so i left because i can't afford it. on my way home, i contacted adult protective services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. so i hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

i also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into oklahoma. my mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. and somehow, i'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... when i got home, i cut everyone out. all of my family. i separated every single tie i had to them.

i've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if i'm being open about the situation, i was a victim of childhood abuse. that cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me i won't be able to get him back. i ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now i'm getting help for my own mental health. this situation broke me, and right now, i'm trying to recover.

thank you everyone for listening. 

**tl;dr:** my cat is gone and i'll never get him back.",2
"update: my landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. wtf do i do.. because i know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  you all helped break the cycle of panic.

original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  it was my roommate saying my landlord had said i couldn't hospice there.

yeah.  i know.

i specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding i would be dying in this house.  i'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  and i guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  so instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""you can't do in-home hospice here"".  


obviously this is super illegal (thanks, la!), and i call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

i started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after i threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and i call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what i was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

so yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because i subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  my attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  everybody wins?  

except i still gotta die, yo.  after i move lol.  at least i can afford it i guess.  :( 

thanks la.   ",2

pretty soon after i posted, i received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. i knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so i googled the law firm and lawyer's name. i couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so i reached out to them. the letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. they asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. i don't know exactly what's happening as i have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200b;

in other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that i also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. we still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

thanks again for the advice everyone!",2
"update coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. can i help prevent this?. link to first post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

glad to say i've got a happy update!

the coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). i wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

the ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. he's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. the dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

police and animal control are very good around here. they assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. and the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

so the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. i'd call it a win!

thank you all for your advice and support!",2
"my school is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (ga). i found this out about two hours ago. my  high school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

in the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; all students who drive to school using a personal vehicle must give the school a copy of the key or key fob.

after i read this i thought it was a misprint or a mistake. so i called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

about 30 minutes later i checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. they went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

&#x200b;

i personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can i do to stop this?

edit: campus is the only place around to park at without paying $100 for a parking pass.

update: the school removed the policy after a car was broken into using the keys from the office. thank you all for the help",2
"i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.. i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

this is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances i worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

i am currently residing in wisconsin.

i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**information:**
my very first inkling something was up, is the day i believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when i picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. and they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

after this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

that night i had picked him up, i changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. this is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or ""washes his hands"" with the baby wipes. this time he was not himself. he was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. as i took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, ""no! no no friends boyfriends name!"" and began crying hysterically. 

my heart sank. as a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. i know something was done to my baby. 

i looked my friends boyfriend's criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. this man is dangerous, and i didn't even know this.

**my concerns and what can i do?:**

notably in wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does cps investigate the person reporting? both myself and the party involve?

will the investigators / cps take this matter seriously when regarding my child's age?

how do i go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

what kind of things will they (either cps or law enforcement etc) look into?

if reported, and nothing happens, what things can i do to protect my child(ren) and my family? 

for a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs i can keep my eyes open for?

any advice, any help at all will greatly help. i'm absolutely devastated and need help as i'm at a loss.

**edit:** i need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why i'm scared for myself and my family.

**edit 2**: i am currently on my way to my appointment with cps and law enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases i will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, i honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome.",2
"my dog keeps getting attacked by an emotional support dog in our apartment.. \wisconsin\ there is an 8 month old male german shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. i have a six month old australian shepherd. we live on the fifth floor and the gs lives about four doors down. we run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

he has attacked my as in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. he attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the gs was hostile. the worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. when we walked inside the gs was off his lease and immediately started attacking my as. the owner did not immediately intervene. i got down to try to get between the gs and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. after about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the gs off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. i took pictures after the event. i had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my as's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

i first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. they said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. i spoke with the owner of the gs after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their gs just for on the grounds. the attacks have happened so often that i do not think they can easily control their dog. my as is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from gs's if he sees them in public.

after seeing the gs and the owner for about a week after these events, i kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. i spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. she said that the 8 month old gs is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. i suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. she said she is not comfortable with that.

i do not know the logistic of esd's but i do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. what should i do in this situation? i feel that if i go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume esd's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200b;

**edit:** this post got a lot of responses and i'm so thankful for it. i read all your comments. unfortunately the post was locked before i even got off work so i didn't get to reply to all.

stemming from the advice i got i contacted the apartment again via email so that i'd have a paper trail, i explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a esd"". i also provided links to local government sites stating that esd's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. i am awaiting their response.

i also called the local department of neighborhood services. i filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

in lieu of this, i then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. the owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. she remembered the incident and said that i had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. she said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

so now i will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. i feel pretty ready to get this started now.

thank you to everyone who came here to help. i really had no idea where to go with this. i'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. i blame the owners completely for this. i'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. my goal is for the gs to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. thanks for everyone's care and advice!

"neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the two spaces in front of our home. after asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving all their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.. california here, getting that out of the way. and full disclosure, its not my home. the home belongs to my parents, but i house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus i love my parents and want what's best for them). i will just be saying my home or my driveway so i dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


these neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with all the memories. i thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

my parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. he has it parked in the middle so that it takes up all the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. it has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. why? i don't know. perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. all i know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

i want to also mention they have a full garage. they also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. and a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

i politely asked him to move his car when i saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. he followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. several days later i visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

i spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since i had asked him to move his car as payback. they said he's really mean and to just let it go. this did not sit right to me, so i later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. i explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

bad idea. i assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. i assumed mom would just tell 'billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. turns out he got it from mom and dad. i get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how i did not just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

i didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. my mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an fu to my mom and dad. that's also when their car got keyed

so since i made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. now the parents are retaliating too.they finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. the one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. the beater was moved so its parked on the other side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. sorry for the run-on sentence. did that all make sense? i hope so.

this has been going on for a few weeks now.

is there anything that can be done? my parent's just seem to want to let it go. not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. my parents travel a lot and my work makes it so i cant always be there to sit the house for them. they fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. i used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


tldr - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. the neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. parents fear retaliation.",2
"(nyc) i am being harassed by the orthodox jewish ""police"" in my home. this has been going on for almost 2 years since i moved in. i am at my wits end, what can i do to stop it?. **edit2: putting this here since this is locked. thank everyone for all the advice/support. i will be following some of the advice recieved and update once i have one. if this works i'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what i've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance i'll have no choice but to move. thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. that has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. yeah it sucks but worst case i can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. and even though the nypd has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've found myself in for what it is. will update when i can.**


*edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home seven times. and this is common.*

i live in brooklyn ny. i purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. i honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

since i moved in though, this has been a huge issue. i don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. i honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. the issue is that they have been using the jewish police to harass me. 
to give you an idea of the shit i am dealing with i'll tell you what prompted this post.  i chose to have a superbowl viewing party today. about 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were five people here) i get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. we were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). my condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people i invited from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. i don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that i have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

i am fucking done. i want this to stop. i have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. i have tried calling the nypd every time they show up. this has not worked. i have complained to my condo association. no help. i have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city and state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and nothing has worked. i keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home that i own with my permission. 

im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. i am just so fed up with this bullshit. i am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a home i own on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

am i crazy here? how is this allowed? what can i do to stop it? ",2
"i (27f) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work. hello,

as the post says i am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **virginia**. i work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. when i was hired i wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. i think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that i'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. i have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. so then i had to buy a wireless mouse. i have a nice computer and i hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

today i have strep. strep as an adult is terrible. i told my boss i could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. that night on the phone she said yes please work from home. first thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. it is a google chrome timer extension. i told them that i would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but i was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. she said ok, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since i wouldn't install the timer and that i was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

thanks for the help!

she ended up taking me to court. her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before i even met her, and she married me knowing it). her lawyer claimed otherwise, that i had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. this was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as i had email communications with her acknowledging my record. she insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

she dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. he was a decent guy. ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. it's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

the last two years have been hell for me. not only because i still can't get over losing my parents (i cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. my mom was actually estranged from her family. she was white, and my dad was black. her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. they have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and i guess i'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

they have told me just that on several occasions. that my existence is a mistake. i get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. and i'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. sometimes it gets physical. sometimes it feels like i'm trapped in a minefield. i have to be so careful about where i step cause the repercussions may be explosive. my ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. he has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

i can't live like this anymore. i'm an absolute emotional mess. i wanna emancipate myself but i don't know how to go about it. i know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 i'm close with a set of twins at school - i'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. their parents own a farm and i work regularly with the family. i'm also into photography and i've been doing real good with shooting weddings. they are very lucrative and i've saved up a substantial amount. with summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but i also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

the parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. i've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. i don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

i would really appreciate advice.

here's the crazy part. i call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. i finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. this woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. she lives in florida and i live in colorado. we do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. so she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. i figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. open and shut case.

so now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. they asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but i have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. the icing on the cake was i got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

wow front page! i want to just thank everyone who's been extremely positive and encouraging and providing great advice in the comments and direct messages. i have some good avenues to explore but likely i think the culprit might be an ex-employee of mine or a neighbor with mental illness. with that said, the neighborhood has been rallying behind us. my wife and i have received multiple phone calls from neighbors expressing support.  we've collected everyone's letter and envelope on our street (except for one because they're on vacation) for when we file our police report.   i have a copy of letter that i wish i could share but this sub does not allow images but i did try and google the wording and it seems unique for those of you that are asking if it's a template.  i will definitely be careful and cautious in the future and keep my home security cameras on just in case.",2
"my ex proposed. i said no. he is now talking about suing me. advice?. just want to say this is going to sound insane but i am not trolling/making it up.

me and this guy were together for 3 years. we're 19 now. we never talked about the future until a year in. before then i'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

in short, i wanted kids, he didn't. i wanted to stay in ireland, he didn't. i wanted to get married, he didn't. when i realised it was a bad match i broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. this happened a few times over the next 18 months in this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

we knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something i would want further down the line, i wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. if i were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then i might have an issue, but when i'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

when i went to see him this time i was again, considering breaking up with him. aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that i really don't like. so when i arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, i assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so i wouldn't cause a scene. i don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

in the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. first he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff i liked and what my taste was. i assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so i told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. i also said ""go cheap"".

the other thing he asked me was how i felt about public proposals. i told him immediately that i, personally, disliked them as i felt i wouldn't be able to say no, even if i wanted to. i feel like public proposals are ok when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not ok at all. i assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

i never thought in a million years that he would propose.

so you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

the ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. he got on one knee, and held it out to me. we were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

i said no.

well, i didn't so much say ""no"". i ran out of the restaurant.

he drove me there, so i got a cab back, and drove home that night.

i realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but i didn't know what else to do. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all i knew was that i didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. i felt like i couldn't even speak, i was so upset about the whole thing. so i just got up and ran.

i just want to take the opportunity to say here that i really really don't care about the rings. honestly, when i want to get married (which is absolutely not when i'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and i'd say yes. i wouldn't even need a ring. i know i'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what i'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

i didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. he said that he thought a proposal was something i'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. he said that he was out of pocket for the rings. he'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. he linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). when i asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped i would cover the cost of mine. he said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. he'd hoped that i would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but i said no. he also said i'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if i was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

we both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on sunday.

he has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that i have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which i had no part in spreading. he says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. so €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

i think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but i am not a law student or a lawyer. he is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

what do i do about all of this? do i need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

thanks in advance :)

edit:  he knew i wanted to get married but not to him. he not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. he openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and i told him that this was why i was breaking up with him the times before this that i have ended the relationship. during the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like i'm gonna propose"" (that one was last april)

"a good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. now his adult son is suing me (virginia).. so basically, i lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. he was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. we watched football together, drank together, and all that. i even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. the point, i guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. i think this point is important.




he recently passed, which sucks. then i learned he left me a little something. that little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since i had no idea he had that kind of money. that 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. so it's not like i'm getting the majority of his estate. but then his son, who i'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  i ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




i have three things going for me:




1. my friend was mentally acute. he had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. our town's not big, and i know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. hell, i even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. these people can be witnesses i think, though i don't know how civil suits work.


3. his adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. she came around from time to time, and knew her dad and i hung out and stuff. the first time i met her, her dad and i were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the south so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





basically, my point is he and i were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? also, what kind of lawyer should i hire? the lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but i don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





edit: you guys were right. the son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. the letter had a bunch of legal terms, so i didn't get the gist when i first read it. i'll be contacting a lawyer asap.",2
"minnesota. i was just informed i have 2 duis on my record... from 2008 and 2004. i didn't learn to drive til 2013.. what can i even do about this?   

i'm 28, i would have been 13 and 17 at those times...    
how can something like this happen? i have never been arrested for a dui or anything similar in my life but there they are, two cases on my record.

update: thank you all for the advice!

"obgyn will not stop calling my dad to confirm appointments, even though i'm 22 (. (using a throwaway in case my dad reddits, would prefer him not to find my account)

in indiana

i'm in grad school, but still go to the same obgyn in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. i was planning to switch once i finished school and settled down. i have him listed as my emergency contact. 

for some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.  

(my father and i have a tenuous relationship, but that's not related to this situation. i will also be switching docs asap)

this has to be a hipaa violation, right? i can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. this could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse. 

tl;dr obgyn keeps calling emergency contact for appointment confirmation instead of my personal number. worried it could get someone in a more vulnerable than me hurt",2
"boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, i was not raped.. i am in boston but my abortion happened in new york city. i was 18 and this was completely legal. 

i'm 18 and in college. like all 18 year olds, i mess up. i messed up big time and i ended up pregnant. i waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, i went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and i took a couples' trip to nyc so i could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

we got back to boston and life went on. i am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. i have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, i'm not considered depressed, i have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. i receive my therapy in a non religious environment. this is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before i went to college, my parents are toxic, and i needed help with that burden. 

i told my therapist immediately that i'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, i go to a university that i worked my ass off to get into and i'll be damned if i let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. i also could not raise a child that i disdained. selfish? yes. but i'm not sorry). i also informed her that my boyfriend and i are still together and that he and i plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. he and i split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

i go home and do homework. at around 4 pm, i get a visit from the boston police who are investigating a rape. they think that i'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that i've been forced to have an abortion, i ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and i agreed that abortion was the way to go. after a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

then i get a call from my parents. they're ranting on and on about how i've gotten an abortion and sinned in god's eyes, how i've been fornicating and screwed every man in nyc, and how my lack of contact (i'm nc with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. they screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

it becomes clear. my therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (i never gave her their number, address, or personal information. she did not know their names, i only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that i'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

i never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. i never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when i mentioned the sex, i called it ""consensual sex"". the police are still hounding me, i'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by continuing to knowingly provide false information to the police (although i gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that i have stockholm syndrome and that's why i won't report my boyfriend, and i'm at a loss for what to do. 

i also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. my boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, i was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). i was not and in the session i said specifically told her that i never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that i was raped at his fraternity house. 

i've also started to get calls from the nypd investigating the ""forced abortion"" and i'm freaking out and don't know what to do. this is serious. 

at this point in time i know that i need to get the police off my butt. is there a way that would help me? is a lawyer the best way to go? also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


edit: when the cops came the first time, i told them that she was completely falsifying everything and i gave them evidence. she is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so i'm not taken seriously. the last time the cops called was last night.

"one of my relatives is ""homeschooling"" her kids, but isn't actually teaching them anything. her oldest is 2 years behind now. nearly 8 years old. is there anything i can do in texas to report her? i heard texas has pretty lax homeschooling rules.. by 2 years behind, i mean that she has admitted to not teaching the kid. she has stated herself that if she were to put the kid in school they'd have to start 2 grades behind. there are other things in their life that support this. but i don't exactly want to give out too many details. my question is simply that if i suspect she is neglecting her child's education what steps could i take? i don't care about your opinions on right and wrong. if i have legal steps to take then i will. if not, then i won't. that simple. having interacted with the kid and other kids that age, the kid is behind in so many ways. and no, their mom isn't teaching some odd curriculum. she just straight up isn't teaching her kids. she is like a very hands off day care for her own kids.

no she isn't doing what ever that unschooling stuff is. she just isn't teaching. she says she doesn't have the time. she is a stay home mom.",2

"il neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). landlord hasn't done anything. i rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. i have a parking pass that i display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

i have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. i have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. i have also kept a log of every time i notice this neighbor in my spot & when i've contacted my landlord. (for what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so i don't think this is just confusion - i don't think he owns a spot at all).

this past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. i confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. i once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, i shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. i called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when i woke up this morning, his car was still there.

additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an hoa, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when i make a complaint about my neighbor. 

i'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as i pay for this spot. with that being said, i'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. what can i do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. what actions can i take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that i am authorized to use?

update edit: i just spoke with the hoa. they confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. hoa also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that i can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot.

"i'm going to sound like a busybody but am concerned with my coworker and her boyfriend sleeping naked with her breast-fed seven-year-old; now she's getting ready to pull her out of public school because her teacher is questioning why the girl is smart but acts like a much younger child.. this coworker of mine is beautiful and very popular, but in my opinion is taking this hippie thing entirely too far. her daughter is smart enough but constantly reverting to acting like a toddler; she's doing it more than she acts her age. i support extended breast feeding but this is getting weird. we work at a health food store; we are talking major crunchy granola.  so, once she let it slip that they all sleep naked in bed together. i honestly do not think they are pedophiles at all, but as liberal as i am, that's still getting weird at her age.  i've always minded my own business, but now she's saying she's going to pull the girl out of the public school because the classroom teacher is starting to question the emotional development of the child. do i mind my own business or make a discreet phone call to cps?  no way in hell would i discuss the matter with her; she's on one hell of an ego trip.  could i do this anonymously? i can't risk cps telling her it was me. one last detail: another coworker's daughter spent the night at their house and they had both girls running around naked, which would not have been cool with the girl's conservative mom, but the adults were not naked in front of the girls. # free spirit!",2
"grandmother with dementia charged $13,000 usd for clothes at strip mall in florida. my grandmother who is 91 with severe dementia was charged $13,000 for five pieces of clothes at a strip mall in west palm beach, florida. we have limited the amount of money she can spend (she wrote checks for the clothes) and so the checks bounced. i have contacted the store owners who sent a 'receipt' for her purchases which is hand written on a piece of paper (no store business information) and just says 'dress $4000' and 'skirt $3000', etc.

i strongly suspect that the owner just made up these prices (that normally they would be sold for much less) and my grandmother was incapably of discerning any of this. my grandmother can't drive and has a full-time caregiver who was with her (and did nothing to stop this).  the owner is now asking me to pay what is 'owed' on the clothes.

"my sister is in some weird cult - mi. no, that is not clickbait and i am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

okay. so my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. she came across a craigslist posting by a woman i'll refer to as aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. i never saw the ad, but i remember my sister telling me about it at the time. she was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. so she began a correspondence with ""aileen"". i did not live with my sister, i'm older by 5 years so i was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

so she ends up going to this place last august, i think, maybe early september. i have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. i was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. that right there was the first time i thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so i didn't push it.

over time, the tone of her emails changed. she would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""aileen"" much. then it gradually became that ""aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""aileen"" made her take drugs. seriously disturbing stuff. i told her she needed to get out of there, that i'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

i didn't know what to do at that point. i thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and i trusted her judgment at the time. it's not like i had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, i didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. yes, i was tentatively concerned, is what i'm trying to say, but i felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

my sister emailed me yesterday and i don't feel like that is the case anymore. something had happened and from what i was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. my sister was forced to participate in this. she seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. i don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

i stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but i couldn't figure anything out. i know my sister took a greyhound to lansing and aileen picked her up from the bus station, so i think this freak show is probably in either eaton, or ingham but as to more specifics, i have no idea. i don't think my sister even knows. i have a hunch they're in, or around mason because aileen made the kids spend the night at seven gables, but other than that i'm coming up empty.

i know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but i really need to know what to do. how do i handle this situation?  

good update: i did what a lot of people suggested with the ip address. i would have never thought of it, i'm not very tech savvy. she is in mason or at least uses that library. i'm going to contact the police there. you guys are rockstars.",2
"nc my dog went missing a month ago and i found her on facebook. the family that has her refuses to return her to me. what can i do?. so a little over a month ago my purebred yellow lab went missing from my backyard. at first i thought she might have escaped but after looking around it turned out someone broke into my backyard and took her. i made a police report but nothing ever came of it and she didn't turn up anywhere.

last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. it was my dog. i should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

i called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. i told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation i all but confirmed it. here's the problem, when i asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because i took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". i told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

i found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. i found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. she is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

"update i have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! and my landlord's response was: ""if you don't like it- just move out!"". here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

i have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400cad a month) in my apartment in ontario, canada.

&#x200b;

based on all of the advice i received from the original post – here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200b;

**i managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* i noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month i was consistently consuming around 2600 kwh. no matter the month – no matter if i was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* i also checked the specific weeks where i was on vacation. i was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- i paid around $70 for each week i was away. a total of $140 i paid when i wasn't even home for two weeks!
* furiously, i called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* she also informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**the inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* i was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* the inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* the closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! feeding hot water to all the units.
* to prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

after emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. we noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). after he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. i had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200b;

**yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *my boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. he is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* my boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and fix this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* the landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**if you don't like it- just move out!""**

**i am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* since my boyfriend and i are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with no hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**my question to all of you:**

1. what do i do now?... can i trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own – even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. what happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. do i need a lawyer?

thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200b;

***edit!***

* thank's to all of you who commented last night! - unfortunately the comments got locked before i could even reply to any of you! 
* i am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on monday!

"(update) bought a ps4 from walmart for christmas and it had books in it. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

ever since discovering right before christmas that the ps4 spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

i took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""we stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. so i've been back to the same walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. i wasn't yelling, or causing issues i just want the ps4 my wife purchased for our son for christmas. 

so the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""i believe this man has been trying to scam us since christmas eve claiming his ps4 had books in the box"". cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that i've been constantly dealing with and i get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

i again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

so the outcome? no ps4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and i cannot do a chargeback. if you are ever purchasing anything expensive from walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. merry christmas walmart.

"wa my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. is there anything i can do?. hi, so my life is falling apart.

as the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. they have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. i love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and i would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

she has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. i don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. the reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but i know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. as a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

i was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. i opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. i told him that if he did end up having custody i would want to be seeing her as often as possible as i consider her my family. he told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. i don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that i am too as a result. i slammed the door. i was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

so basically, i have a few questions:first, can anything be done to stop him having custody? there are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research i have completed.

third, at the very least, could i contend in a court that i have visiting rights to her? i'm not actually related to her, so i'm not sure what the standing is there.

third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway i can straight up adopt my step sister? i have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, i have an apartment of my own, and i would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**edit: i want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. i'm at my wits end and i will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and i don't care about the cost.",2
"update: my ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (florida). **edit:** forgot to add this...my first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

firstly i would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive pm's i received. it was really overwhelming (in a good way). a few people asked for an update so here it is.

so a lot has happened since i first posted. i called in to work while i was trying to get all this sorted. one of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. my husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. my daughter went to physiotherapy. eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. i was against it but the court ruled against me.

i gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. on her second visit it happened again. this time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. the next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. the neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. they had to cut the brace off my daughter. my husband and his wife were arrested. they got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with cps. my ex lost visitation and custody and i'm working on making it permanent. unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. it set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. she needed surgery and is still recovering. she always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. i hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. right now i'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. that's my update.",2
"when i die, i want to mix my ashes with the seed of a tree. my family loves the idea too for themselves. we want to start a family ""groveyard"" (get it!?!?) of deceased relatives and ourselves.. im in california and looking for some land to purchase for this purpose.  if all goes to plan, the lot will eventually have trees with a plaque that says ""here grows so-and-so"".

does this count as a graveyard?  can i buy non-hoa land that's intended for residential use and do this?  i'd hate to drop $10k on a half acre and have to cut my dad down in 20 years because of a zoning law or something.",2
"good news update! ca grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. brother sold his when they were worth a car. i left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. brother and his girlfriend want my half now.. mostly good news.

i worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

i got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. what my brother and i inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. my grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. she didn't do the same with mine before she died (i thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when i was old enough to know how to take care of them. there was no trust, she just trusted my dad. my dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. my dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. my brother found out i still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. that's how my brother found out i still had shares and they'd grown.

according to all that info my lawyer tells me i'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. i say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. the letter i received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

a week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. his girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. i felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures i might have given him some. the next morning i found all my tires had been slashed. screw him, i don't feel bad any more.

the rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise i don't know nearly enough about what i'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. a lot of the decisions i've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because i knew it would but because i had no idea what i was doing and left it up to him. i've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what i have. thanks for all your comments.",2
"i found my 30 year old fiance talking to 13 and 14 year old children. what is my next step?. i apologize if this belongs in relationship advice but i am pursuing the legal route instead

i found messages on my fiance's snapchat account of him talking to two different people sexually and romantically. i took it upon myself to message each girl myself to get more information before i left him. upon talking to them i discovered that one girl is 14 and one is 13. the 14 year old claims that my fiance was willing to drive to her to have sex and that he also sent her explicit photos. i have no proof of these claims and neither does she due to him deleting his account and the profile is no longer able to be searched and messages cannot he retrieved. she also had one of my fiance's best friends added to her snapchat profile and was able to prove that his friend did send her sexually explicit photos of himself as well. 

we also have a one year old daughter who i am going to protect from him at any cost. what can i do to ensure this?

i have not contacted the police yet. i am not sure if a crime has been actually committed as i'm unfamiliar with the law. i just need help knowing how to get my ducks in a row and what my next step should be.",2
"banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.. in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

i used to take the bus daily to get to work. not a big deal, i'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

but every thursday was awful. every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. still, generally not an issue because i'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

but this bus company was not reliable. we have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. one day, a little school bus came instead. it had 9 seats. since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. so you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

i have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, i needed that time to sit down. so, that's what i was doing, as always.

the group gets on the bus, i've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. i look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. i take out my earbuds and she says to me that i need to give up my seat. the other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when i tell her i need it she says that i need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. i try my best to explain that medically i can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says i'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). so after a couple minutes of this i snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as i'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. she gives me a look like i just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

two days later when i tried to get on the bus i was told i was banned from the service.

when i called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. i explained the medical reasons i needed it and was simply told i have a lower priority because i'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as i ever knew. he ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as i know, but i feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

on my original post it was suggested a lot that i make a post here. i live in ontario, canada. i don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. i know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

anyway that's why i'm here for help. am i in the right to sue? for how much? i don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

edit: there's a lot of responses on here so i'm sorry if i don't get to everyone, but for now i will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the ontario human rights legal support center on monday. thanks everyone. i'll still be accepting further advice if there is more i should do though obviously i can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

edit: i gave them a call. it went well, should be covered from here. thanks all.",2
"when i was hired i was given a key and told if i lose it i owe $15,000. i lost it. do i have to pay up?. i am located in michigan.  

okay so when i was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) i was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  i was told that if i ever lost said key i would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

i have lost this key.  (it was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. i was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

so now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money i owe.""   i have received letters from their official letterhead and i am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. and they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

i have no intention of paying the fine.

the catch is that i was told this was the consequence verbally when i was handed the key.  my supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   i replied with ""to be clear, i will not be paying that if i haven't signed yet.  do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  my supervisor laughed as though i was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

well he never brought it up again and i of course did not either.  

my question is.  can i be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" at this point i have not reminded them that i never signed.  i have simply ignored them.  but i worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and i'm not sure how to proceed.  i will be visiting my lawyer monday.  so hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. i can not afford this ""charge.""

"cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. he was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. i have her recorded confession. what should i do with it? (arizona). she accused him of rape years ago. she was 18 and he was 22. it was false and never happened. he was arrested and eventually convicted. when he served his stance and got out he was broken. from what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. he tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. his record, his name on the registry and lack of options. he went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

yesterday was 3 years since his death. this cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. i said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. i went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). she told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. i asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

the voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? i want to make my brother's slate clean. not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). his son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. if so, how do we begin the process? do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

what consequences (criminal) will she face? will she go to jail?

and, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? of course this belongs to his son now although i don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). and can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? this conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

i know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. so please help put me in the right direction.",2

"ma man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. now they won't take it off until he verifies that we don't live together. he's blocked my number.. i bought a car last year from a mutual friend that i didn't know well at all. everything was fine until this past june, when he fell into some heavy debt. he gave me a call sometime around june, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which i refused. red flag number one right there. after this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than i should've been monthly for this car). i eventually just gave the car back and that was that. i gave the car back mid july and purchased a new one (nissan altima) from a legitimate dealer. this morning i received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. i calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don't live together, (we absolutely do not) i still have to pay it. this is absurd, how is this allowed? the guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can i provide proof for someone else? this is in massachusetts and i have progressive insurance.


update #1: okay so a lot has happened since i first posted. for starters, i should clarify some things. we signed an agreement that i would pay monthly increments for the title. until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. initially he said i would be under his insurance, but only a few days after i saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. i did not have the car in my name, which is why i was able to give it back so easily. i just thought ""screw this drama, i'll just get a new car."" today my adjuster happens to be ""out sick"" but i reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. a representative of progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. i have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. i've been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. i'm expecting a phone call and will update soon.

update #2: not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. luckily i kept all of the text messages between us, which i attached to the reports i filed. with my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it's a bit difficult to get this taken care of. after i settle this, because i am not paying an extra $500, i will most definitely be switching providers.",2

i'm told by the end of the week i should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything i need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so i can continue to survive until i can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

i'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

i am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

i probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure i was going to be ok and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! i also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that i won't make and explained the situation. they are somewhat understanding and hopefully i'll be back at work soon to keep current. 

thanks for everyone's help and advice! ",2
"i called 911 for a medical emergency and the police showed up and verbally harassed/threatened me. should i file a complaint? (pennsylvania). i don't really know where to file this under flairs.

tonight, i had to call an ambulance to my apartment. my boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. he then had a full-on seizure. 

later on, i found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. i don't know much about that. i do not do drugs. i do not even smoke normal marijuana. i called an ambulance because i didn't know what else to do - i was scared. 

three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. asked where he was. i started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as i was annoying them. i complied. then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

he said my pupils were completely ""blown"" and i better start telling the truth about what drugs i do. i told him that i have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. he told me, ""stop fucking lying to me now or you're getting arrested for drug possession."" again, i denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - i am clean. he left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. then the third did the same thing. they kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying i was the biggest liar they had ever met. at this point i'm amped up and scared. i am a 23 year old woman. i am in nursing school. i do not do drugs.

at this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. they were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. they ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). the largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  i reiterated that i am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. he retorted with ""i highly doubt that"" as he continued to tear apart my home.

eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. the largest turned around and said, ""congratulation on ruining your life. don't call an ambulance when you are on drugs, i'll see you around"".

not only am i shaken, but i feel threatened and ashamed. the man i was with should not have been on anything, but i called an ambulance because i was scared he might die! i didn't call them to be harassed. did they even do anything really wrong that i can report this? we live in a small town in nepa. i know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they'd find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest. they found absolutely nothing. no one got arrested or charged. they also refused to give me any badge numbers and told me if i kept inquiring i'd be in more trouble.

*update*
i tried to file a police report and the chief basically said ""save yourself the trouble and do not"".
i started a gofund me to move:

"my coworker admitted to making false reports against my ex-boyfriend to get him disqualified from becoming a police officer.. about 6 months ago, my boyfriend was permanently disqualified during his application process to become a police officer. it was very odd as he's never had any legal trouble, he's never done drugs, there was really no reason to be disqualified. he has a criminal justice degree, he volunteered with the police department and he has background in security. the police refused to disclose why he was disqualified.

well after hanging out with a mutual coworker, he very openly told me he was trying to ruin my boyfriends life and he filed a report saying my boyfriend threatened him and was very temperamental and aggressive and that he was scared of him. they worked together and went to highschool together. 

he then told me to make sure i told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. he even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight. 

i feel like i'm in a very bad position. would showing the police our texts possibly get the disqualification reversed? is there anything i can do legally? it's been about 6 months since the disqualification and i'm in arizona.

edit: i wanted to add, his reasoning for doing this is because he wanted to also ruin our relationship because he wanted to be with me.",2
"bought a house, sellers stripped the garden and the interior before moving out. i found a nice house which had everything i was looking for: a nice garden, good location, built quite recently .. so i made a bid and the owners accepted. at closing day, the previous owners asked if they could stay 1 more week (their move wasn't going smoothly, so they said). i didn't mind so i said yes. fast forward a week and i find out they have left without telling me and have stripped a lot of things.  most plants and a small tree have vanished from the garden (leaving a cratered landscape). some parts of the interior have gone missing as well. this is what i found after entering my house: cupboard doors are gone, laminate flooring in the hallway was taken out, every kitchen appliance disappeared (built in oven, washing machine ..). there wasn't a single light fixture (or bulb) left, some door knobs were removed and they even pulled out the kitchen sink. how do i proceed from here? this can't be legal, can it? location: california.",2
"rover.com dog sitter lost my dog, hindered his recovery and damaged my work contract in the process.. i hired a well reviewed rover.com(https://rover.com) dog sitter to watch my dog on fri in order for me to work on a contract out of the city. i dropped my dog off at the sitter's house at noon on fri, and at 8:30pm he sends me a message letting me know that my dog had escaped. (something about his girlfriend and a open door) i break my work contract and race back to the city to start looking for him, and posted his info on several social media sources to get as much exposure as possible. i find out through bunz and fb that my dog was sighted about a kilometer away at 6:30pm, so this guy waited several hours before letting me know that my dog was missing.

i get into the city and start looking on foot. he informs me that he has called the police and tas (toronto animal services) and has ordered a set of missing posters to put up in the neighbourhood trough rover. he then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. great right? this is where things get unpleasant.

it's -10c outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider i realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. i call rover.com(https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. i get a tip from facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to tas, but i needed to call them for a more accurate description. i call tas when they open on sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. at that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that i would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) this is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

i continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, i double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. i finally get a tip off to his location through facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. this is after 17h straight of walking in -10c weather. i covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because i was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. i couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

i speak to rover.com(https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. it turns out they were never collected from the staples that printed them. so this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. i have them now as evidence.

&#x200b;

emotions aside, is there any course of action i can take to deal with this person? by lying about the search, the posters and the tas report he delayed valuable search tools that i could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. i also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

this guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. i'm at a loss for how to proceed. (if at all) 

edit: to clarify i did eventually find my dog, he's safe but it was a hellish experience.

"update: flneighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent. link to original post in case you need it: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants\_cutting\_down\_my\_magnolia\_trees/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants_cutting_down_my_magnolia_trees/?context=10)

i've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, i can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) the day after my post, i called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since i inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. he went to both houses the next day, saying that i had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. he went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how i need to learn my place. after he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) i conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. as expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. i'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, i never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until i watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) the bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that i'm getting married!"" the pastor, feigning innocence, said ""i thought she was evicting you all because your father and \groom\'s father cut down \my great-grandmother\'s prize magnolias?"" hardest game of you-laugh-you-lose i've ever played, still proud i survived.

4) according to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say i would be quite happy with half that number, but i know when to zip my lips so i'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) they did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. i have enough savings/inheritance left that i can live without the rents for a while, so i'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before i was born.

6) the bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. they had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (am i a bad person for being amused?)

7) hurricane michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) my boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

&#x200b;

other than that, you'll have to wait until the eternally slow court systems process through. i do want to take a moment to thank you all for thinking of me, and being so helpful with your advice with what was a terrifying ordeal at the time. i'd never really stood up to my elders like that before, and it was comforting to know that not only did a gaggle of internet strangers have my back, but there were resources and protections in my community as well.",2
"ma a restaurant manager purposefully switched out my celiac boyfriend's non-gluten meal with a normal one due to her disbelief that he was intolerant. so i wrote about this last night just after it happened on another subreddit, and was advised by many of the comments to post here for some clarity on what recourse we could actually seek from this.

i won't be writing out the whole incident again in as much detail as before, but if anyone reads my earlier post and thinks i've missed out something crucial, i'll be happy to edit the post.

my boyfriend and i went out for lunch yesterday at a restaurant we have dined at before. my boyfriend is a diagnosed celiac and has been for many years, and when this place was recommended to us originally we were told the restaurant has specific gluten free items, and a specific area where such food was prepared to avoid cross contamination. we had a great time, and checked online before going back again yesterday and saw there were no complaints about people being 'glutened'. we arrived and ordered our meals, with my boyfriend specifically ordering a gluten free appetizer and entree, something that the waitress stated would come with a different sauce than advertised as the usual sauce was made in the general area of the kitchen and as such could be contaminated.

we have no issues until the entrees come, when my boyfriend is served a dish of pasta with the advertised sauce. the waitress thinks that there's been a mix up in the kitchen, and comes back a minute later to say that someone else has received his gluten free pasta and the kitchen were rushing out a new order. she said she'd comp our appetizers and try to get us a free dessert, something she'd have to check with the shift manager on first. we see her go over to someone we assume is the manager, and then minutes later the manager storms over and asks us what kind of scam we're pulling. she says that the pasta was definitely gluten free, and we tell her that because of my boyfriend's celiacs we were told that the normal sauce wasn't safe and were waiting on a new dish with a new sauce. she started to complain about fad eating and sensitive customers (something we attributed to us being young and therefore 'millennials'). the waitress came over with the new dish with the new sauce, but the manager snatched it from her and started to walk it back into the kitchen saying that the 'precious table' couldn't be served something that she hadn't checked. she came back a few minutes later with what we assumed was the same dish and wouldn't give it over to my boyfriend initially, sarcastically asking if she wasn't us to drag away the chef from their job and tell us ourselves it was safe. we said it was fine, and rushed to finish so we could get out of there, probably finishing our meals in about 10 minutes.

we flagged down our original waitress and asked for the check. she was a little while, and when she came back to us she looked like she'd seen a ghost. she told us that she'd gone back to the kitchen to check on another order, and noticed a pasta dish that looked exactly like the one my boyfriend had eaten sitting on the side. she asked if it needed to go out, and was told that it was the one the manager had brought back about 15 minutes before. the waitress said that she thought it had been brought back out to the customer, but was told that the manager had only come in and asked the chef working with pasta dishes to simply drain some normal, gluten-containing pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce (my boyfriend had ordered a tortellini style dish and there was a similar one on the regular menu, so he wouldn't have noticed by appearance or taste alone).

the waitress had comped all of the food on our check, but i insisted that we paid for my dishes, and tipped her well over the average, just in case she was penalised for the manager's mistakes. she went above and beyond what was necessary by telling us the truth to help us in preparing for my boyfriend's future 'glutened' state.

my boyfriend started having a reaction just before we got home, and spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom having a serious response to eating a whole bowl of gluten. as of this morning the worst is over, but he is still having serious stomach pains that will be occurring for the next few weeks at the very least.

on my original post, i was given many different types of advice; i was told to both post and not post a scathing review, to sue and not sue the restaurant, and to get the police involved over a 'poisoning' incident or just go all vigilante on the manager. as i have been looking after my boyfriend all night, i have not been able to research any further, legal ways of dealing with this. as a note, my boyfriend has not and will not be going to the er or doctor about this - we already have everything we could possibly need to manage this, and it would simply be wasting time and money. however, if people advise that we need medical 'proof', we will be happy to pursue that.


tl;dr - my celiac boyfriend was purposely 'glutened' by an irate manager who didn't believe he needed a specialist meal, who and what should we pursue to get this manager fired and the restaurant investigated?",2
"update: i am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. i got found out.. i post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

since that time i got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until i landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

recently i found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what i used to do, and pays more. basically tired of doing nothing even though im getting paid for it.  

the day after i mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office i got a phone call exactly at 8 am. the head of hr for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. i asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. she stated that there were no issues like that. they just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

i told her that they should have that information as head of hr and promptly disconnected stating i had to return back to work. she called back at 12:05 exactly. 

i have been ducking her calls ever since. her voicemails state that i am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. my emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. each time i am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. she calls at least once per day. 

i am thinking i just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

how incredibly bad is that plan? before anyone says it. i know... i know ok i should have quit a long time ago. i did not.

"update: fiance may die, sister wants half of our house if he passes.. i apologize for formatting/grammar errors. i am on my phone.

my post got a decent amount of attention. i thought i would update since i still get really sweet messages from people wishing me well/praying for me and my family. 

my fiance, now husband did pull through! he's currently in our backyard setting up a tent to ""camp out"" with our 2 and 3 year old boys. he was in a coma for over a month and the doctor's were pretty sure he would never wake up. his recovery was slow and he still goes to physical therapy 4 times a week but he is pretty much back to normal now and we couldn't be happier! although it was a horrible thing to go through it changed both of us for the better. you don't realize how much the small things matter until they're about to be taken from you. 


he was appalled by his sisters actions when i finally discussed it with him. we recently both made wills and made sure there is no chance sil or bil will get any money if both of us were to pass, or god forbid our children too. we also chose godparents for our children and we are expecting a baby girl in 2018! 

i really appreciate all of the sweet thoughtful messages i was sent. they definitely made me feel better on bad days to know how many people were praying for him! ",2
"i adopted a dog. they said they gave me the wrong dog even though the photos match. now the adoption clinic is trying to sue me.. i live in texas and i recently adopted a puppy from a humane society several hours from my house. before arriving i paid the adoption fees via a phone call and then arrived and filled out adoption papers for the good girl. however the next day the clinic called and said that they had accidentally given me the wrong dog and that i needed to return her as some other family had also filled out the adoption papers for her to which i refused. they then said they were going to press legal action on the basis of ""stolen property"" if i didn't return with her within 24 hours. the dog i adopted is clearly the dog within the online photos that were posted for her and they handed her over to me without checking her chip..they said that they could be sued if i didn't bring her back and they didn't check the tags so are they not at fault for giving out the wrong dog?

the puppy i adopted is clearly the same as the one in the photos posted online and i've already bonded with her, taught her tricks and introduced her to my entire family over the last several weeks she's been staying with me. they say that even if i return her they still want me to pay their attorneys fees. please help me anyone i don't want to lose my dog and i don't feel like i'm at fault for their mistakes.

edit: the large amount of responses is greatly appreciated. it's an incredible help to me to be receiving many different perspectives on the scenario as well as slightly reaffirming to know that many believe the courts would be sympathetic to my stance in the situation. i am a young man recently graduated from high school and have never faced such a level of legal threat before and was honestly in a panic about what to do. i'm doing my best to read yalls responses and get back to you with any additional information you may have requested about the scenario.",2

"boyfriends ankle monitor is dying, his charger isn't working and no one from the house arrest company will pick up. what should we do??. trying to get this update out there proved to be harder than i thought. so i put my update here. 

op is still published at the bottom of this post

i know a lot of people were concerned about the reason behind my boyfriends house arrest sentence. which led to an entire post on r/bestoflegaladvice being dedicated to how gullible, stupid and naive i must be for believing his reasoning. whelp! he got off house arrest on tuesday (9/10) ((yay!! :)), i asked if he would mind if i uploaded his ""certificate of completion"" to reddit and he said that was fine.

certificate of completion (https://imgur.com/a/by974wg)

a few people asked some really good questions so i'm going to try to be as clear as possible:

he really was not on probation or parole. when he went to trial he was given the option to ""complete the program,"" which was a year with a privately owned house arrest company. if he failed to complete the program he would be sentenced to three years in prison.

the terms of his house arrest, as per the company's rules, where that he was allowed one grocery store trip a week and needed to provide sign-in and sign-out sheets for his daily work shifts. he could not leave the house otherwise unless explicitly approved by the owner of the company. every other week he was required to ""check in,"" which means he had to go into the house arrest place, sit down with someone, and provide receipts for his trips to the store as well as all of his work slips to prove that he was at the locations doing what he was supposed to be doing. he had to pay the company $60/week to be on house arrest with them (which was quite an expense but definitely better than prison). 

now that he has completed the program, he hands over his certificate to a judge to show that he served his time and he is now eligible to reapply for a drivers license (which was obviously revoked when he was ""sentenced"" due to dus charges).

he was never on parole. he was never on probation. this entire ordeal was due to being a ""habitual traffic offender."" a year of house arrest. for driving without insurance. he could not afford the insurance and was driving to get to work, to afford the insurance, he even switched up cars every time he drove. does any of that make what he did okay? absolutely not. but i did want to provide proof for those who were concerned that that is why he was put on house arrest and for no other reason.

tl;dr: my boyfriend was sentenced to a year on house arrest due to traffic violations, no other reason. he has completed the program and now we're going to the beach.

thank you for coming to my tedtalk i hope this cleared things up. sorry for the lengthy post.


certificate of completion (https://imgur.com/a/by974wg)


op:

title explains it all. what is our best course of action to prevent him from going to prison if his monitor dies before they open in the morning? i suggested maybe filming himself sitting at home for proof he didn't go anywhere. he thinks maybe he should call the police and go into the station so that he can be supervised, maybe put in a holding cell overnight so that he has witnesses that he didn't go anywhere. 

time is a factor. what do we do??

edit: thanks everyone for your feedback. he called, left a voicemail, sent a text, sent a video recording of the monitor and charger not working (he has been on house arrest for 11.5 months we definitely know what it looks like when it's supposed to be charging)((he gets off sep. 14! :)), his supervisor has an iphone so we even shared his location with them. everything we could think of.


at 12:29am we got this text back:
""sorry so late.. i have been traveling today and not near a computer or cell coverage. i looked it up and it should have showed you on charge but hasn't. either it's not connected or charger not working. still showing low battery. call the office at 9 and talk to greg about it. i'm sorry.""

crisis averted. sounds like we'll just stay put until the office opens and then we'll go in to get everything checked, and we'll be sharing his iphone location with them until then.

i would like to take a moment to address a few frequently asked questions:
1. we are in south carolina.
2. he is not on probation or parole. he has never in his life been convicted of a crime. he was actually put on house arrest because he acquired too many traffic violations (none of which were duis, which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous).
3. the house arrest company is a privately owned business. there is a man and wife who charge every person they keep on house arrest $60/week. capitalism ladies and gentlemen.

thanks again for everything and if anything changes i'll let y'all know.

final edit: we went in to the house arrest place today after they opened, they gave him a new monitor, a new charger, a back up charger still in the box, and even knocked 4 days off his sentence!!! horribly, horribly stressful event had a relatively happy ending. thank you everyone who took the time to read and reply.

editedit: people are getting pretty mean, this got way out of hand. i want to genuinely thank everyone who responded to this post with helpful information when we were in need of advice, and our issue has resolved since then. i may make a separate post with all of the interesting information and developments that came about as a result of this once i get some more organized/tangible information, but honestly it's late and hate mail takes a lot out of you. thanks again to everyone who was sincere and wanted to help.


absolutely, positively, nonnegotiable final edit: okay kids, it's been a long day. we laughed, we cried, we learned a lot about ourselves. but at the end of the day, after grilling him, background searching him, and even calling his mom, it has become abundantly and unquestionably clear that my bf's current house arrest sentence is 100% due to three dus (driving under suspension) arrests. he was pulled over driving without insurance, three times. irresponsible? oh absolutely, he's known from the beginning how i feel about it. but, he is not, nor has he ever been, 1)in prison 2)on parole or 3)on probation. the disconnect was the difference between arrested and convicted, that is where i was confused and as a result confused some of y'all. he had been arrested several times when he was in his teens (a very, very long time ago) and all of them were for dumb teen stuff like petty shoplifting, which he never went to prison for. was that stuff irresponsible? yes. illegal?? also yes. but a long long time ago and entirely unrelated to his current house arrest sentence? you betcha. we had a good laugh about how dumb he was as a teen, he remembered a lot and i learned a lot. to everyone saying i'm dumb for believing him about his current situation: you had me really questioning things for a minute there and i'm sorry to disappoint you but that's all there is to it. he will be getting off house arrest on september 10th, and to celebrate we're going to the beach. the end.",2
"mylife.com has a profile on me with identifying information. their website falsely claims i have a criminal record. isn't that technically libel?. long story short, i googled myself and saw the first result was a link to a webpage for a company called mylife.

it's a little jarring to see that a company i've never even heard of has a profile on me with my pictures, my hometown, political party, and phone number. it's a little more disturbing to see them falsely claiming that i have a criminal record, which is the first result for anybody who googles my name.

it's not that big of a deal, but they seem to have this ""alert"" on everyone's profile saying that ""\insert name\ does have arrest or criminal records.""

i know anybody with more than two brain cells would realize that this website is a scam, but out of general curiousity, i was wondering if this would technically be considered libel, considering my record is perfectly clean save for a single traffic ticket for an expired registration sticker.

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7go96c/ne_hoa_towed_away_my_car_and_built_a_chainlink/


so the hoa board got a lawyer to respond to my c&d and they requested a meeting asap with my lawyer present as well. i didn't want to go but my lawyer suggested me hear them out at atleast. at the meeting, i noticed there president and some of the higher ups were not there. 

the board had no idea what the hell was happening and their lawyer was just as confused as them. after i laid out my timeline of events they thanked me for my time accepted all the financial burden of replenishing my pond, missing car (couldn't locate it), and damages. 

i got checks for everything and got my pond restored back in april and didn't really think much of it. 

i found out a few weeks ago from the new hoa president. turns out the old president, tresaurer and someone else had been stealing money from the coffers. they wanted my land to expand and put in a pool, clubhouse and etc just as i saw on their website. the old board fined everyone a ton of money to get all the cash together and buy my land. instead they spent it on themselves. they needed my land somehow so they thought they could just take over the land i wasn't using.


long story short, their entire plan fell apart after i fought back and brought to the other members of the hoa attention what they were doing. from what i've been told, they had to sell their house to pay back the hoa and have since moved away. the hoa has offered me market value for my land and i do plan on selling since i really don't use the land for anything and the money isn't bad.

i did not file any complaints with the postal inspector or anything, since the situation resolved itself. i got a new project car and for those asking it was a '98 supra with a bad engine. my new project is a '67 fastback that i plan on restoring to look like elanor. :)

i want to thank a ton of redditors for chiming in with advice including a few from nebraska. 

/u/silvoan
/u/immo406
/u/dracofaerie2
/u/whatarestairs
and others that pmed with advice and support. 

and lastly /u/20000to0 for advising me regarding nebraska laws and getting me in touch with his awesome lawyer(i guess mine now too)

"cousin needs a life-saving hysterectomy but insurance doctor won't approve because ""she's not done having babies."". my cousin has been getting these terrible infections after having her first child. after trying a few treatments, her doctor informed her she's at serious risk of life-threatening hemorrhaging and she needs a hysterectomy. however, when her doctor tried to clear it with the insurance, their doctor (who has never met my cousin) informed her that he would not approve of her surgery **because she's young and shouldn't throw away her chance to have more children.** he said, ""if you were 40, i'd approve this. but you're \young\ and only have one child so far.""

this seems incredibly wrong to me. i know people have tried taking on insurance companies before but how on earth would you start? thank you for any support at all. she lives in utah but the insurance company is based out of minnesota.

update: thank you everyone, especially those of you who reached out including doctors, insurance specialist, nurses and everyone else. i relayed all the information on to my cousin. her doctor had completed the peer to peer but she's begun the appeal process with help from a lot of your comments. i really appreciate all your help and she does as well.

edit: my cousin put out a video with more details but i can't include it as it has identifying personal information. i've also removed any mention of her exact age.",2
"updateoregon neighbor cut down trees on my property. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/


hello legal advice community! i have not forgotten about you, who helped set me on the path to justice! i'll get right to it. i can't speak to all the details, and i'm sorry about not continuing to update (after everything got underway i figured it would be best not to). to keep it short, we (my lawyer and i) spoke to the police, who then spoke to the neighbors down and across the street (the one who witnessed my trees getting cut down) who stated they saw the neighbor and the company cutting down the trees, and then finally they spoke to him (neighbor). i don't know much beyond that with the criminal investigation, what happened with the whole city document or the company, and why that is will be explained below.


i hauled his ass into court. well, first, the arborist came, as did the surveyor. the trees were on my property and they were white oaks. the arborist gave me an estimate on having 15 mature white oaks brought and replanted on my property, which was just shy of $650,000, though he did say some trees would die and that would drive the cost up. i also had my property appraised, for the difference before and after losing my trees. it then became a question of whether i wanted to pursue my lost trees and see how much their lumber was worth, or sue for the replacement cost and loss of property value. basically, do i want the trees back or do i want the cost of the ones i lost? (apparently you can't have both).

well guys...

i picked the trees.

the actual court stuff started a lot sooner than i thought. we filed, a few weeks passed, and a few days before our day in court his lawyer reached out with a settlement offer. apparently he was wealthier than i thought. we accepted and while i can't speak to the details of it...

i'm getting the trees back!

it's going to take a long time apparently (several months, possibly all the way until september since the process didn't start until just this week due to the holidays), but i will have all 12 trees back on my property at no cost to me! my neighbor has also put his house up for sale, and i haven't seen him for quite some time now. oh well! there's a bit more to the settlement, but i don't feel comfortable speaking to that, hopefully that's understandable.

i remember some of the comments about whether the trees were a hazard to the road based on how far they were from the road. i ended up having to check with the county (not the city), and they sent someone out to measure and mark the boundaries. my trees were at least 5 feet beyond it (so outside the boundary). not even close! just thought i'd add that in.


anyways, there it is! i plan to take photos of the trees once they start getting put in, and of course once they are all in place and i have them back. i'll be sure to share them! i want to thank everyone for all their advice, it was a huge help! i didn't know you all were so into trees, but i'm glad you are!

have a good one everyone!",2
"my abusive ex sold my house without my knowledge. i inherited my mom's house when she died. a couple years ago, my then boyfriend moved in with me. but he turned abusive and after a particularly bad night about a year and a half ago, i fled and moved to another city. i just heard from a mutual friend that my ex moved out of state several months ago. 


i went to my house over the weekend to check on it and make a plan to move back in but there's another couple living there now. they said they bought the house and have all the paperwork to prove it. when i tried explaining that i actually owned the house they acted like i was crazy and threatened to call the police unless i left immediately. 


i'm heartbroken because not only have i lost a place that is sentimental to me, but my abusive ex got all the money from the sale. is there anything i can do? i'm in maryland.",2
"mother in law suing my wife for ""grandparent rights"". so today in the mail we received a letter from the county court of where my mother in law lives and she is suing us for ""grandparent rights"" a little back story.

\*courts based in upstate ny\*

over the last almost 8 years me and my wife have been  together her parents always have despised me cause i was a punk city boy and my wife was a good country girl. we moved in after 6 months and have been happy together since. we got married back in 2015 so we are coming up on a 4 year anniversary and things got better for awhile until we bought our first house and i got a job where i started making a lot of money. me and my wife now live a very comfortable life nice cars house etc.

back on thanksgiving of last year is when shit hit the fan. her mother said some very hurtful stuff about me and my wife to my brother in laws girlfriend, my wife and her are very close so she tells her everything and once the beans were spilled my wife confronted her mother about it. her mom made every excuse under the sun instead of just saying sorry she was wrong (we know she said it because there was text proof). we haven't talked to her only once or twice since thanksgiving.

today we received a letter in the mail from her county court suing for grandparent rights everything i have read they can only sue if we are ""unfit"" to be parents. my wife and i don't have any alcohol, drug problems, or trouble with the law we have been happily married for almost 4 years and our kids are well taken care of no debt etc. we also never once stated ever she could not see the children not verbally or over text. we just sold our house yesterday expected close is early may and then we are moving to south carolina this has been a plan for years and we finally acted on it back in december.

does she have any ground to stand on? does ny have any laws to that effect where they could force us to give them the kids for visitation? can this stop our move from happening and screw up the sale of my house? any advice is much appreciated.

edit - thank you for everyone who has commented on this post i am trying to read over them all and you guys are amazing i plan to consult a lawyer so we can not have this hiccup our plans to move, but holy crap i didn't expect these responses you people rock!

update : we double checked over the doc and its nothing just yet she filed in her county and they transferred it to mine, my wife is calling tomorrow to see what the next steps are so we can get it rolling prior to our move. thank you for all of you support and i will catch up on comments at work tomorrow it means more then any of you know! also she filed the junction the day after we posted our house officially for sale i looks clear as day that she is attempting to block my move, as well as a few other stories rolled through dms last night about more or less her not having a relationship wont hold up in court and my mom said the same thing she is a paralegal.

"suicidal best friend checked herself into a facility while she recovers. she requested i take care of her children (1m 3f). her family took them instead against her wishes. (ut). my best friend is a single mom. the other day she had a mental breakdown and became suicidal. she has made an attempt on her life in the past years and years ago and knew if she didn't get help immediately, she would kill herself, and so she went directly to the emergency room. she has been moved to a behavioral health unit while she recovers mentally and is ready to go home.

she has requested that i take care of her children while she is gone. we are very close and her children love me. she trusts me completely with them. we have plans to move in together in soon. i am not a parent, but i have the means to take care of them and they would be happy.

i received an unnanounced visit from some of her family members (grandmother and cousin). they wanted to watch the children for a little bit. i was fine with this as i wanted to visit my friend to see how she was doing and stock up on food and supplies for the children. my friend was very upset that i let her cousin watch her children and requested i pick them up as soon as possible. she has always had difficulty with trusting her family and didn't want her cousin parenting her children.

her family doesn't want to return the children to me. they claim they are worried about child protective services stepping in. they believe/claim if the children are found in custody of a friend rather than family member that the children would be taken as custody of the state.

what can i do in this case? her children are in no way neglected and would be completely safe and cared for by me. i have taken time off work and will be with them 24/7. she even wants the children to be with me and not them. does her will not matter to cps? would they actually take the children if found in care from a non family member? or would i be completely fine caring for her children?

**edit: i have received a lot of great advice. thank you! i will be going to get the children asap. many of you suggested getting the delegation of parental authority completed. i can attempt to do so but she is only allowed an hour of visitation per day. she also has no idea what is currently happening with her children and with her mental state i am worried of giving her extra stress knowing that i am having difficulty getting them back. should i continue to have difficulty, i will have to get her to help with getting the documents signed. i would like to keep this as peaceful with her family as possible, which it has been so far. i understand their concern about cps and i'm hoping that the advice i receive will help convince them that they have no need to be worried and cps won'tbe an issue. should i show them my home and that i am 100% capable of caring for the children to alleviate their concerns?**

**edit 2: i have the children back. i talked with their mother on the phone and she assured me cps was a non-issue. she even insured that her family were not listed as caregivers, and another close friend of hers is. her friend is with me in this and believes i am fully fit to have them. still facing a lot of opposition towards me having them and i'm working through getting the proper paperwork signed.**

**edit 3: thread has been locked but i have received plenty of helpful advice. thank you for all of your well wishes. i have pumped up an air mattress for them as all the beds in my home are really tall, and they love it. the 3 year old calls it her balloon bed. i also found pillows that look like eyeballs and they think it'sthe coolest thing their bed has eyes. i am so happy to have them and relieved that they will be safe with me as we wait for their mother to return home.**",2
"kid reached over the wall and filmed my daughter while she was crying in a bathroom stall at school (6th grade) in texas. the kid then posted the video to social media.. that happened about two weeks ago.  it was initially pushed down to a guidance counselor as a ""friends issue"".  my wife went to the school about a week ago because the issue had yet to be resolved; a group of girls were still picking on our daughter.  since then, one the assistant principals conducted an investigation.  the girl that did the recording is still running around the campus with her phone, and now our daughter is labeled a snitch and bullied even more because of the way the school has handled it.

needless to say, we're a bit pissed.  our daughter won't be going back to that school.  we're not really sure what to do next.  do any of you fine folks out there have any advice on a way ahead?

edit: forgot to mention two important details:
1. the kid that did the recording...she admitted to doing it in a written statement to the school. she denied posting it to social media, but other kids have told our daughter they saw the video posted on music.ly.

2 .  our daughter has a 504 plan for anxiety and ptsd.",2

"update my father got my 14 year old sister pregnant.. a lot has happened since i posted.

i talked with my sister for a long time over the next week and she eventually agreed to talking to an adult at school. i went with her to talk to a teacher she was close with. after a lot of crying together she called the police and our school counselor and principal. they basically didn't let us go home that day from school. 

we ended up getting a case worker and parents of my sister's best friend (not the mom who was constantly harassing us about going public) took us in temporarily. we are currently still with them. 

the police visited my dad who won't admit to raping me or my sister, but they found a ton of child porn on his computer and other things they wouldn't tell us about. he has been arrested for the child porn. unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. it's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. people wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

my sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. we are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... ideally.. 

she and i both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  mom is still not in the picture.

i fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. my case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. thanks for that advice reddit, i got that from here. 

anyway, thanks for the advice. it helped me talk her into how serious it was.

"update ""my work's fun committee ignored reasonable request, hr told me to pound sand."". https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8826mu/ny_my_works_fun_committee_ignored_reasonable/

(new york)

a lot has happened over the last ten days.

i realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  i cannot live like this anymore.  and i mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

i was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that i was completely prepared to just stop living because i was too scared to find help.  so i went and found help.  

i took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, i found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  i've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

when i finally went back to work, i took the head of the fun committee aside and talked to her.  i explained to her that i have ptsd and some very severe anxiety issues and i apologized for not being more clear to her when i asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

and she cried.  she wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought i was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

then, i spoke to my manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where i can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  it is literally all i have ever wanted.

so, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  apparently.

"(ohio) cop blocking my driveway and harassing me and my wife.. **edit** 

holy wow this blew up. thanks for the silver kind stranger! i received so many messages, so if i don't reply to your message i'm really sorry. i will go through and reply to as many as possible!

i have received so much amazing information on this post since i made it. unfortunately it is a holiday today and i am going to try spending today with friends. i am, however, going to follow up tomorrow with the police department and see if we can't figure this out. no updates or calls back as of yet... i'll keep everyone posted.

as of 12/31 at 3:40pm est i have called about filing a complaint with the police officer in question. i have yet to get a call back. i'll update everyone here when i get a call back (if i do.)

hello legal advice!

so, here's some backstory:

me and my fiance moved into this new place back in april. we've been living here since then. the town i live in is incredibly small and only has around 150-200 people, maybe more. the cops around here are notorious for pulling people over. there is a major highway that runs between here and cincinnati. they are most always out on that road because the city jurisdiction extends across that highway, they almost are never monitoring what's happening in town. 

fast forward until now. there was a cop sitting at the 4 way in the middle of town that my fiance had passed (she works with horses and drives a truck that's kinda loud). she was pulled over (in our driveway) for this exhaust issue. she took the loud exhaust ticket, paid it, we put a new exhaust that helped quiet down the truck, all is good. right? nah.

now, this guy knows where we live. he drives by all the time and he knows when my fiance leaves for work. he follows me now, in my 2010 honda civic (it's a completely legal car, no real reason for him to be following me) all the time as i do the speed limit, pay my taxes and abide by the law. there is an abandoned house across the road where he will sit at and ""clock"" people, however, it's right across from our home.

today was the last straw. when my fiance was leaving for work, we was headed in from town from picking up our cat from the vet. he is sitting at the 4-way stop sign in town. he sees us and makes eye contact with us and then as i'm almost home begins pulling out. my fiance needed to go to work, so i decided to let her use my car so that way there was no risk of her being pulled over in her truck (even though we fixed the exhaust like he asked).

on her way out, he sees her leaving and pulls up and blocks the driveway, not allowing my fiance to leave. he sits there for about a minute and then drives down the road a bit, waiting for her to pull out so he can stop her. she calls me and says she's afraid to leave, so i tell her to stay for a bit. he eventually pulled off and pulled over another loud truck.

here's the kicker. my ring doorbell has the entire occurrence of him blocking our driveway on camera. i've saved a copy to my phones storage. what can we do about this? this is clearly harassment and this guy doesn't let up. it's a shame when i'm fearful to leave the privacy of my home because this guys following us around in an unusual way. is there any way i can make a city complaint against him to get him to stop? i only fear this will make things a lot worse. cops are meant to protect and serve, not harass and observe. 

feeling lost here, could anyone give me some useful advice?

thanks, sorry for the long post.",2
"minor daughter refuses abortion.. tw: sex, minor

&#x200b;

throwaway for obvious reasons. i'm still shook and my boyfriend and i have been freaking out since we found out. i'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

our daughter is 11 years old. we found out she was pregnant. she had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. we never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

it was clear she had a crush on him, but i never thought anything of it. until she started complaining about things, i'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when i had been pregnant. 

i didn't jump to the conclusion, but i did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

they'd been having sex. god knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. i won't go in to details. because i never wanted to imagine them myself. 

we had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. my boyfriend was fuming after i told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

they knew as much as we did of the whole thing. they were as shocked as we were. we've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

but she keeps saying she wants a baby. and i just don't fucking know what to do. i tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  i was trying to be level headed. but she didn't seem to understand at all. we've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

what can i do? is the boy, or his parents liable? what can a doctor do? can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?  
i'm at such a fucking loss. my world is crumbling.

"i think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. what options do i have? (ok).  i'm a high school teacher. i work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. ""dan,"" my ""across the hall mate"" has  been here 8. his son,""leo"" has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. since dan was the football coach, leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. leo would  often visit his dad's classroom before and after school and i got to  know him as well. leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

this past summer, dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. they asked me if i would be a source of support for  leo while they were away. while leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so i would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. i also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. the last day i was to be in this role, leo sent me a very  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. i told leo that  was inappropriate and that i would be telling his father.

i showed dan the text and he claimed that leo's phone must've been  ""hacked"" or ""played with"" while leo was at work. i didn't believe that  explanation, but i accepted it and moved on. the next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could ""hold on to me"" and ""take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler"" and ""kiss me gently."" i forwarded the texts to dan and did not  response to leo.

dan came to my house the next day and said that leo was not sending  those texts. he said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. then, i started getting texts through some ""unknown number""  that were the same in tone and writing. a selfie of leo nude was also  sent. i called dan, thinking this might be something happening at leo's  job or something.

this didn't stop. i was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. as soon as i blocked one, another popped up. i went down to the  store where leo worked and spoke with the manager. (i taught all of his  children). he told me that leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker's phone and he had already talked to dan about it two weeks  ago! so, dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

i changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. this included my new number. dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. the next thing i know, i'm getting crazy texts again. i  said something to dan at work. dan said leo was ""harmless"" and i should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more i avoid him, the  more miserable it makes leo. dan even said those days that my number  stopped working leo became very angry and dan had to give him  medication.

last night, when i got home from work, my kids told me that leo had  come by looking for me. i was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. the kids said he arrived in a car, but not dan's car.  my son guessed it was an uber. i don't want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

am i being stalked?  
am i being unsympathetic to leo's problems?  
is it wrong of me to expect dan to manage his son's problems?  
what do i do next? 

i'm not going anywhere, and i doubt dan is, so we will be ""across the hall mates"" for another 10 years…

officially as of today jane has vacated my apartment, and building management has changed the locks. we were able to come to a signed agreement where she agreed to vacate the property within 7 days if i refunded her last two months of rent. (\~4200$). which i did. honestly between this and my other legal fees i am basically in the hole, and i would have been better off not having anyone rent my apartment. 

i talked to someone who is doing a story on jane, and they were able to confirm that she apparently works for a company rents out places on airbnb (said person who was doing a story basically told me they weren't going to pursue this anymore due to time concerns). she isn't a grad student nor is she even a student. 

i don't feel like i won, and honestly i just feel absolutely infuriated with the entire situation. airbnb to this day still has my place being listed on airbnb. who knows why she doesn't have keys anymore. 

my apartment is a disaster right now and from what my property manager has stated it seems like people definitely did smoke in my apartment. there are burns on my couch from cigarette, my dishwasher is broken, and pretty much everything needs a desperate deep clean. but my apartment is safe more or less. 

anyways i wanted to thank everyone for your advice. it probably isn't the best ending but it taught me an extremely valuable lesson, and i can go home at christmas and hopefully clean my apartment. ",2
"ne hoa towed away my car and built a chainlink fence on my land. so this is part 3 and most likely the final update for now.

link to past: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/


so i was away for the holidays and i came back on monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to hoa. i immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. the car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so i have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. it's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the hoa.


i had my lawyer draft up the c&d and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. i hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since i'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

my lawyer suggested i send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. a local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested i ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. the hoa has lawyered up so i think it's best i no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. i didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. i've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. it's bad but should convey the land.

"i'm pregnant and i want to leave my husband update. hi everyone,

i want to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and words of encouragement. i read every single comment on both threads about my situation and i really really appreciate the support and help. if not for the advice here, i probably would not have felt justified in leaving.

i'm sorry for taking so long to post, but i am now back home in nh with my parents. i feel like i'm coming out of a fog and i feel really stupid for believing everything; i guess i just justified it by assuming laws were different in the south. 

i left with just my computer, my phone, my documents, and a few family heirlooms. i'm not concerned about my phone being tracked as i am still on my dad's phone plan. my husband has sent me about 200 texts and has filled my voicemail completely but i haven't spoken to him.

i managed to withdraw half the balance of two out of three joint accounts. the third is a local bank and i did not want to stay in the area any longer. my parents told me to just leave the money. they are going to help me get the medical procedures i need and then they are going to help me pay for a divorce attorney. i thought they would say i told you so because they told me not to get married, but they have been very supportive and even offered to pay for me to go back to college and finish my degree. 

thank you again for all your kind words!",2
"update - phd student here being accused of plagiarism. only that it's my own work that i used. massachusetts.. i posted earlier(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my phd thesis.

to make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what i had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. this wasn't a direct copy & paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

last week i got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that i talked to. the email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, i will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

i asked for appointments with a few people. head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. i haven't managed to see any of them yet.

today, i received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. they apologized for the stress that this has caused. a little later, i received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who i talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

so that's that. now i can graduate in peace. i cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. thanks all for advice. ",2
"being sued for helping a choking victim (or). i was eating at a diner with some friends at 3 am, the guy in the booth next to us started coughing and gagging. i realized he was choking and went to help him, i had heimlich training at my place of work (i'm office safety manager for my floor). the guy managed to get the thing out and it flew across the booth. he looked really pissed, payed his bill and left. i felt like a little hero the rest of the dinner and then just kinda forgot about it. this was two weeks ago.
 
today i got a letter from a law firm that i'm getting sued for battery, they said i bruised a rib, i have no clue how this guy figured out who i am. i thought i helped the guy seeing as he probably would have choked without help. how did he figure out who i am? i never actually spoke to him. is this a real letter? do i need a lawyer for this?

"my college says if i miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes. (ia) i was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

i am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and i'll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

i'd spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days i'd be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work i'd be missing. 

unfortunately, one of the days i'll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

his request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if i missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

my professors were comfortable marking these as ""reported absences"" which basically means there was a justification like a doctor's note or other official documentation. 

i showed the deans that i was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn't  even really like i had a choice. i figured that would be enough documentation. 

the dean said that ""personal non-medical conflicts"" could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if i'd just  slept through class). they suggested i apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise i'd be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

this attack took enough from me already, i went to great lengths to be sure i didn't miss a day of school while recovering, i do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

i spoke to the title ix office who'd promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

i do not want to take a leave of absence. all my professors were ready and willing to work with me and i was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

do i have any legal recourse here against the school? 

thank you in advance. ",2

well, a lot has happened since that day. my daughter is safe with me and was let out of the hospital about a week ago. she is getting better every day. i know though, you guys want the full story so here it is

&#x200b;

after i made that post i took the advice given to me and the next time i saw my daughter i told her that it was wrong of me to ask her to keep secrets and that it's ok to tell her mom. along with that i saw a lawyer recommended to me by a trusted party. when i went to see him he told me that this is ""a case lawyers salivate over"" and that my ex is in a lot of trouble. i immediately filed for emergency custody of my daughter. i also got into contact with the doctor again and explained the situation fully to him. he says that while he will not be getting lawyers involved that he wishes for me to submit the evidence to the police and file a report. along with this, my lawyer has gotten into contact with the court that originally ordered us to vaccinate our daughter and has handed over everything i gave to him. he has advised me to stay quite on this matter so i'll leave it at my ex is in a lot of trouble with them. 

&#x200b;

during this time, my ex started to get suspicious. maybe it was because a friend told her about a post on reddit and she freaked out? who knows. a few days later when i saw her at the hospital we had an altercation. she became hysterical and yelled various threats and insults at me. including telling me that i want to ""poison our daughter"" right in front of our sick child. she was escorted out of the building and the head nurse had banned her from coming back. after this she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that i am a monster and that if she had vaccinated her that she would be dead now. this was sent to my lawyer. as he puts it, ""she's what lawyers dream of when they hear who's on the other side of the court.""

&#x200b;

outside of this, i've been advised to stay as quite as possible so i'll leave it with this. 

&#x200b;

this week i received emergency custody of my daughter until our custody hearing later this year. i have heard that the da is slowly getting ready to move forward with a multitude of charges against my ex and that will land her in jail soonish.

and that's really it for now. i'm going to follow the advice given by my lawyer and say nothing else to anyone. i do not want the media involved in this for a few reasons so i've left this as vague as possible. when this is all said and done, if the interest is still there i may come back again. but for now, thanks for the advice in the original thread, me and my daughter appreciate you all.

"what happened to my brain damage settlement?. when i was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car i was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head. there was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. my left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. my heart ended up stopping for a while and i was revived. i went through brain surgery, pt, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

i hate to bring this up at all but i know i was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. im grateful to be alive and i don't want to be a money grubber, but i feel that was rightfully mine or at least i have a right to know the details. my parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet i'm about to be 23 and whenever i bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

again i really hate to do this but i'm not a money grubber. ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. it's just i want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money i don't know came from. i'm not saying i'd ask for it back, for all i know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but i still have a right to know. how do i do that without help from my parents?

edit: this happened in missouri, stl.
(5/5) thanks for the legal advice and ive been able to use case net to find my old case. unfortunately it looks like it was dispositioned by both parties for an out of court settlement? but i do distinctly remember being awarded a settlement. specifically when i was called into a corporate looking building to testify in front of alot of suits. i'll try and look into it by calling the courthouse and then lawyer. 

but im also surprised by the mass of hate mail in my inbox. some even depicting me to be a future serial killer headcase. despite my head injury i'm fully able to lead a perfectly normal un-serial killer life. thank you.",2
"update i allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say i kidnapped her to avoid child support (ct to ny). update of my previous post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&#x200b;

tldr: i didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&#x200b;

so, i had my day in court today for the child support hearing. dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. my sister (let's call her valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but i'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because i could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

the judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that valerie is now 18 and in ct would be ineligible but in ny would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of valerie and that mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  then he said how valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that mom never speaks to him about anything, that i make no effort to have a relationship with him and that valerie doesn't either. boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

he then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. at that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, i piped up and asked as calmly as i could manage ""why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

my mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if i could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. valerie was 17 at the time she moved to nys and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and i've been her sole source of support ever since. 

the judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. my mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. the judge asked me what amount i was looking for. my answer was that i just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so i asked for a total of $250 from dad and the max $50 from mom. dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). the judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and i held firm on $250. dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

the judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 and i never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for dad's intimidation tactics.

"ca i want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a jehovah's witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1).. so i started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and i's simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were ""poisoning us.""  they would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  since cutting those people out we have been better.  i want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

this is when i started looking deeper into this ""religion.""  long story short, i want as far away as i can from this stuff as well as my children.  i'm a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  i have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so i'm living off my gi bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  my spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

i thought i was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that i've learned more, i can't.  i've tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  the religion is designed to warn her about people like me, ""worldly"" people.   she goes on talking about ""the end"" all the time like she is anticipating it.  i hate to say it, but i fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  she doesn't want to go to any conventional counseling because ""other people don't need to know our problems.""  i have no idea what do to at this point.

i probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while i try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  i only have about $15,000 in savings, and i own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  we have furniture and stuff but i'm not attached to any of it.  i have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military sgli to a vgli and that's it for assets.   other than that, no big debts or anything.   

over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  i was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because i left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  the only thing i didn't do much was cook, which i only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  i spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn't last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

as i right this, i hide my children's easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the ""holiday"" she is not allowed to celebrate.   the psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it's hard on me to have to see them do it alone. what kind of parent doesn't want to have fun with their children smh.   

what is a divorce going to look like with her? i really just don't want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.  i don't want to pay her long term.

edit: omg i cant believe this took off. i'm literally crying.  people are sending overwhelming positive words and advice after i have felt so alone for years.  i guess this is locked now, so i'm not even sure this edit will go through, but i will post in the exjw sub., as that is what of a ton of advice has said to do.  thanks to all so much for your support from the bottom of my heart.  the selflessness of you all to help a stranger in a time of need is what i believe makes the world go around, and a lot of people could learn from.",2

thanks for your help and for pointing me in the right direction.

the challenge was getting her into the consulate in karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the us. we bought tickets for her to go from karachi to doha and then to boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

by the time her parents realized what's what she was on the doha to boston flight. her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the us but their visa applications were refused. i'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

we were sued via small claims court for half of the amount of the ac unit. the case predictably was dismissed as we didn't misrepresent the condition of the 14 year old unit.  

what was interesting is that he genuinely thought that we owed him the money. almost to the point of self righteousness. the way he talked about us; what he supposedly was told with nothing evidentiary to back up his claims. additionally stating that his lawyer said that his case was strong. his lawyer didn't manage to show up to court but still very strong case. oh well. it's over.

"accidentally 'drink and dashed' yesterday, would it be stupid of me to go back today and pay the tab? (eu). so there's this bar me and my bf semi-regularly go to, recently they changed the way they serve drinks. you used to have to go to the counter, order, they gave you your drink, you paid then and there, done. now they have a server who goes to your table and it all works like in a restaurant. except yesterday we kinda forgot that when we finished our drinks (a cocktail and a beer, about $4 all in all) and left. this morning it kinda occurred to my bf that we forgot to pay.

i know morally going back and paying is the right choice. but what if they won't take the money and instead want to get the cops involved? because right now they don't have any identifying information of us aside from descriptions, but if i go back and essentially confess, that's pretty damning, so should i go back and pay our tab?

edit: this all happened in eastern europe, part of the eu.

update: i felt really guilty so i went back there around opening hours. they were extremely above and beyond nice about it. apologized and explained the situation. they said it was nice of me to come back, but there was nothing missing from the till so there's no bother. i'm pretty sure we didn't pay so i insisted, but they were like ""don't sweat it, if you really didn't pay then this round was on the house."" tbh i'm so embarrassed i probably won't go back there for a long while, but i am glad i tried to do the right thing.

i went into the bank as soon as i happened but the teller told me it was my money and so did the one beside her. they said the manager was not available. i went to another bank across town and i told the manger there but he said it was mine. i called their customer service twice and have recordings of both calls where they said it was mine. i mailed them a letter and i didn't spend the money.

then 10 days later i was arrested for stealing the money from the bank. i was at my job as a waitress when i was arrested and they fired me when i went back after i was released. it was a saturday afternoon and they told me i would be in court on monday. i told them i tried to tell the bank but no one listened. on monday morning i thought i was going to court but they gave me my stuff back and said i was free to go and the charge was dropped.

"a 32 yo man picked up my 16 yo daughter from school (with her consent, obviously without mine) and they had sex shortly after. do we have any legal recourse? mi. the child is my step daughter. she was picked up from school after a half day while her mother and i were working. after she was picked up, they went to the man's place and had sex (it doesn't matter, but she was a virgin prior to this). 

she was then dropped off near our home and walked in our home before her mother or i were home yet. she met the man via a mobile app days earlier. this all came out today during her counseling appointment (she has ongoing issues with anxiety and a lack of friends/feelings of acceptance).

ignoring the fact i am unbelievably upset with her and will be dealing with that situation separately - do we have any legal recourse against this man?

i believe the age of consent in michigan is 16, but i do not know how that works as far as getting picked up directly from school without permission from parents and if that is allowed. to the best of our knowledge no pictures were exchanged.

fwiw i understand and accept the fact that my step daughter made this decision on her own, and that it is jointly a failure of us as her parents that this happened (read: i do not blame the man for this happening 100% as the step daughter and we as parents should have done better, but i need a place to direct my anger).

edit: one thing i forgot to include was she said he gave her a marijuana vape pen to use, if that matters at all. marijuana is now legal in our state as of a few months ago, but certainly not for a 16 year old.",2
"i was filmed against my consent at a party. (update). last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

history: myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. in a private villa where expected things to be private. a pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. i asked if we have legal options against the person.

we went to the police. myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. they didn't. they said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

it sucked. i didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone i know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

but this didn't end there. this perv didn't stop. he tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. they got him and handed him over to the police. so he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. they took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

he's now locked up. our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

it took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

"coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if i don't have sex with him.. so a guy i know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. i thought i had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but i guess he somehow found the video. we work in the finance industry and i do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. the guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

this is also because i went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

so, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, i'll just call myself h, he found revenge porn of me online. at first i was relieved that it was him cause i've known him for so many years and thought i could trust him. then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. horrified i push him away. he then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if i come over to his place and have sex with him. other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

we're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. that day i just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

he's told me that i should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

i feel so betrayed, since i thought we were good friends. and i'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. i've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

if anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

tl;dr- coworker found revenge porn of me online. he's been sexually harassing me and is threatening to share it if i don't have sex with him.

edit- many people are telling me to go to the police. it's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. he is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. he's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone i know if i don't have sex with him. 
also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. i'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

"i think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare x-post from /r/parenting. originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested i post here... edit per bot request: we are in california.

my son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. at the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because i needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (we didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

he seems to really like it there. most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. he seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. he occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on fridays, but not every friday.

i'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. he never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. he's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""i don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. i thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when i dropped my kid off on fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

we had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. until today. we finish up dinner and i get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. i'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. it should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! but cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! pretzels now!"". not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). he did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". my husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. he did this several times. (just typing this is making me nauseous again). my husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (we only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). my husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

my husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. we didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local pd dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

i've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but i have no idea what to do. local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. i can't in good conscience send him back there again.

are we overreacting? do we just confront the director? how do we handle this? i obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


edit:

first, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. we are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. we are also very grateful for all of the advice.

second, an update. our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. we didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. we'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. i have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

this morning my husband called cps and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. the school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). we met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. when she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.  as frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did). as many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. the social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. we were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. if anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time. 

i think that covers everything that happened today. my husband had to go back to work so i've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. if there are any developments, i'll update again, but that is it for now.

thank you again for everything, reddit. you truly came through in our time of need ❤️

"i believe my hippa rights were violated when my surgeon's scheduler told my parents i was pregnant. i never thought about the situation like this but i had people point out that my rights may have been violated and i'm not sure what steps to take next and i'll try to explain the situation the best i can.

i am 24 and live in the usa and i'm on birth control but it failed. i didn't realize i was pregnant until i went into the hospital for something unrelated and found out i needed surgery for something and that i was pregnant on the same day. i quickly looked into abortion options but haven't been able to go through with it because i haven't had the funding but i'm trying to figure that out now so i can get the surgery and be healthy again. 

i went for my surgical consultation and the doctor said he would feel much safer waiting for me to terminate before performing the surgery but i would have to schedule the surgery through his assistant a. a called me shortly after the surgical consultation and pressured me the entire phone call to keep the baby but when i told her i was planning on going through with the termination wouldn't schedule my appointment until i had gone through with it. so i've had to put the appointment off and wait until then, which is fine, but my parents are in on why i need the surgery and i've had to come up with excuses as to why i can't schedule it yet because i don't want them to try to pressure me to not terminate. 

fast forward to last tuesday and i get a text from my dad that says something to the effect of 'we know why you haven't scheduled the appointment and we're very disappointed in you.' it turns out that they called the office and the assistant disclosed my pregnancy to my parents and it's causing me a great deal of emotional turmoil because my parents have been acting super weird around me and now i'm doubly stressed about the situation. i never gave her or anyone else to disclose my medical status to anyone and i feel like my rights as a patient have been violated.
 
i guess my questions would be: do i have grounds for legal recourse, what would my next steps be and what should i do from here.

edit: fixed a word bc i don't proofread

"in 4 days ago i accidentally almost got into the wrong car, causing the elderly woman inside the car to try to flee and she fell. today i was told i'd be sued if i didn't pay ambulance & er bills.. 
four days ago (monday 11/4) i was parked in a very full parking lot and returned to my car in a distracted state. i didn't realize that i was parked next to a car that was identical to mine. i opened the unlocked driver's side door and put my leg in, but immediately withdrew my leg because i heard someone inhale sharply and then heard the passenger side door open. obviously this wasn't my car so i began apologizing and, as i was shutting the door, i could see an elderly woman struggling to get out of the car.

i was still apologizing when she fell out of the car. i went around quickly and asked if she was alright, did she need me to call an ambulance, did she need me to go find whoever she was waiting for, etc. she told me i didn't need to call an ambulance, but asked if i would stay with her until her daughter came back. she didn't know which store her daughter was in and didn't have her number memorized. i helped her back into the passenger seat. 

she had an abrasion on her right palm, which i offered to disinfect since i keep a first aid kit in my car. she accepted and said she wasn't hurt anywhere else, just shaken up. she asked me for water and i gave her a bottle from my car. she told me she was diabetic and that her blood sugar was low and she didn't have her insulin with her, so i offered her a banana. we spent about 5 or so minutes together before her daughter came running up.

we explained to her what happened and the daughter was pissed at me, rightfully so since i did scare her mother and she fell. i offered again to call an ambulance to make sure she was alright and they both refused. i suggested they take her to her doctor as soon as possible to make sure she didn't injure anything from the fall. i apologized again and went home. 

this morning the daughter and her husband showed up on my front porch. i think they were trying to intimidate me since the husband stood there the entire time with his arms crossed and with what i assume was supposed to be a scary look on his face. 
the elderly woman and i only exchanged first names so i don't know how they found out who i am or where i lived. i asked and they said they ""had their ways."" the daughter told me she ended up calling an ambulance because her mother began to have a panic attack before they left the parking lot. i asked if she was okay and she told me that wasn't any of my business. she said that they were going to sue me if i didn't pay the er bill and the ambulance bill. they said they wanted $3,500. i asked if her mother had insurance and was again told it wasn't my business. i asked to see the bills because i obviously have my doubts and they said they didn't have them with them. i said ""so you expect me to just hand you $3,500?"" and that pissed them both off. i told them to get off of my property and that i'd call the police if they refused or came back. i told them to have their lawyer contact me. they both called me a bitch and left. 

i've included every detail i can think of, so my question is could they really sue me? i understand you can basically sue anyone for anything, but am i legally responsible to pay these medical bills if they do in fact exist? 

thanks in advance. i'm on mobile, so i apologize for any formatting errors. 

edit: thank you to those who responded. i'm 31, but often get mistaken for someone much younger. the daughter and her husband are, or look to be, in their mid to late forties. i suspect they may just have seen what they think to be a young and naive woman that may be dumb/scared enough to pay them.

i do have a home security system. i can also defend myself should my home security system fail. thank you to those voicing concern for my safety.

i don't know much about diabetes. the woman told me she was lightheaded, that she had diabetes, and that her blood sugar was low. she asked if i had any food and i gave her the banana in my purse. she specifically mentioned not having her insulin with her.",2
"update tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant\_is\_renting\_out\_my\_apartment\_on\_airbnb/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. the last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

i have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

my condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. apparently there were noise complaints on friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

on sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were airbnb tenants, and they said yes. he then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. she also stated that she will be going to the ltb to ""make a formal complaint because banning airbnb is not allowed"". when i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people. she went a rant about how she is doing this for numerous places and how she has never had a problem and ""how stupid i am for making her my enemy"".

i have a ton of proof of what she is doing, honestly my biggest concern is what is going to happen to my apartment. i asked a friend to book my room for one night through airbnb for tomorrow (as it just apparently became available for rent), and take a look at the state of my apartment.",2

"(ok) mom passed away and things aren't adding up.. update

the last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  i kinda feel like i'm living in one of those crime novels. at one point, i seriously considered walking away from it all because there were enough things that took place to make me feel like it was a possibility i might find myself having some kind of ""accident"" in the near future. 

i obviously won't be able to share too many details...at least not yet...but i do want to let everyone know i have an attorney, as well as a private investigator who is a retired fbi agent with a lot of connections. as of today, i have finally been able to locate my mother's body and it has not been cremated. i also have been granted access to her property.  a lot of things are missing.  the vehicle has been reported as stolen as well as a few other items... which i'm sure the list will grow as we continue to go through her belongings. 

thank you to every single one of you who offered your help, resources, experiences, and condolences. i will never be able to express the amount of gratitude i have for your willingness to help a stranger you've never met. you guys are amazing!!

to those of you that called me a karma farmer and questioned the validity of my personal hell...i hope you step on legos barefooted and catch your pinky toe on the coffee table. when you do, think of me.




i'm not really sure what to make of all this and i could really use some insight on the matter. evidently my mom passed away last wednesday june 5th...i say evidently because my brother and i weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

i'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and i'm afraid if i try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but i feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.  

we first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (see...weird huh?) he claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) she told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

my mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while i'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because i haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and i wasn't even aware he had my number. he immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. they supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,  he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and i, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend sheriff whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and his attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to salvation army. he was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

how is that even possible? can he do that? i mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and i are required to attend? is this how this stuff goes down? i really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and i can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. but my feelings aside what is the legal process here? how could i find out for certain if there even is a will? 

the situation gets a little crazier because after i called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and i are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming wednesday because he has meetings all day tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. to my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

this makes me think there is no will. if there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and i were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

i'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

the most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, i know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.  she reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...i'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? or even if they don't?? sorry for the long post. i'm still trying to understand all of this. it just doesn't seem to make any sense. who should i contact first? the police in her area? an attorney? what do i do?

update: i can't respond to anyone now that its been locked but to answer a few questions. no i haven't seen the body though my own eyes and neither has my brother. he and i are getting together today to get a lawyer. this is in fact very real and i'm not making it up at all. i created a new account in hopes of not being recognized as this is turning into a very tricky situation. my brother and i are both very overwhelmed at the moment and we're in a bit if a situation where we aren't exactly sure who we can trust.  as far as my  motive behind mentioning my mother's invention...evidently that was precieved as making this entire thing seem like a made up story. all i can tell you is, sorry i didn't disclose that in a manner which made it more believable for you. i guess i'm poorly communicating the events i've been through recently and to be honest, i'm trying more so to get actual advice, not to make sure you believe me.",2

im 17. i have saved up 40k (legal money) throughout my life. 
i want my mom and dad to receive 50/50 of the money. 
do i need to sign some contract to make sure it happens or does the bank automatically split the money between my parents? (its my own account, neither are co owners).
i cant ask my parents on it, since they are in denial that im dying and refuse to talk about anything relating the fact that im dying. 
also what about life insurance? is it possible for me/my parents to take a life insurance on me even though its a official fact that im dying? 
i want to give them as much as i can after my death, because i know that my mom wont be able to work after my death.
advice pls?",2
"(texas) power of attorney seems fishy?. so, i'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time i try to, they threaten me with this. i do have mental disabilities, however i am fully functional and i also have never been diagnosed. this leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. i do remember my parents dragging me into an ssa office when i was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. they just told me to sign it without question and being my parents i didn't think to question them. later they told me that i had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. every time i try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since i'm disabled and i have no guardianship over myself, whoever i go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. i'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. they tell me i'm crazy and helpless and i can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

&#x200b;

other things that might be important that make my question things:

they don't care about my well being. they don't allow me to go to therapy even when i've asked. they refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when i finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. i know for sure i do have a mental disability, i just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. they've always been controlling and i wonder if this is just another method. i get too scared to call suicide hotline when i'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" i've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and i have a hard time seeking help. i feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200b;

anyways, how do i go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? what are their rights if this is true? what are my rights? can i, i guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? what can i do about this?

&#x200b;

is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that i haven't thought about asking for? can i do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

&#x200b;

i should also i add they sabotage any jobs i try to work because of the poa thing. i currently help my mother around the store they own and they pay me randomly and i'm not on any official payroll that i know of. is this also legal????

&#x200b;

i have so many questions and i feel so helpless and lost. i'm sorry.

"employer lured me with an offer letter that has terms that are impossible to meet.. i graduated from pharmacy school in june of 2018 and i was hired by a pharmacy chain to work in california. i went to school in a nearby state and had to move for this job. 

my offer letter says that i have 90 days from graduation to get licensed. it is not possible to get a pharmacist license within 90 days of graduation in california. the process takes about 4 months. i was verbally told by my district manager that the letter is the same in every state and that they don't enforce that 90 day rule.

i moved, passed all the tests, and got licensed in october. i was put on the schedule for only 16 hours each week. the schedule is for several weeks ahead. i brought it to the attention of our scheduler and the district leader. i was told that i might get more hours at some point if i learn to work more efficiently.

i pointed out that my offer letter says full time work. he says the term isn't legally defined and it can be whatever the company defines as full time. he also said that the offer letter was void because i didn't get licensed within 90 days. he said that if i work with more urgency and get my speed-based metrics up, then everything will be just fine for me.

is he correct about all this? i went on the company website and they define full time as 30+ hours in order to get health benefits.

 i don't know a lot about the law, but it feels like it would be illegal to lure people with an offer letter that they know has requirements that are impossible. the board of pharmacy has lots of documents available online which show that a 90 day requirement is impossible to meet.

"alabama tailgated by police for 3 minutes, then searched and ticketed for going 56 in 55.   

i'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. cop car gets in behind me. bad experiences with cops so i do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. i maintain speed limit. after several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and i get pulled over. they search my car and repeatedly make me do several sobriety tests. i ask to blow into a breathalyzer to prove that i don't drink or do drugs but they didn't have one and kept making me do sobriety tests for around 10-20 minutes while searching my car.

they didn't find anything after wasting my time for half an hour, then gave me a traffic ticket for going 56 mph on a 55 mph road.

not sure if this is legally relevant, but i'm a black male in my 20s with no criminal or traffic violation record. i also had an lsu sticker on the back of my car.

is there anything i can do regarding this, or do i just chalk it up as part of the alabama experience and just fly next time i need to pass through the state? i have a frontal dash cam which did not catch the tailgating behavior but can prove my speed.",2
"mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear. i have a big family, with around 20 cousins,  10 aunts and uncles, and several others who always show up to family  reunions. i'm a male in my 20s.

last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. on the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. this air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. this campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

as soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. he showed no remorse whatsoever. he laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

i was so furious when it happened that i didn't know what to do. i sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. i wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while i emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. but instead i  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. it's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. it's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

he clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. while everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""i heard your ears were ringing. sorry about that."" he didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. i grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but i absolutely do not forgive him.

this happened last saturday, a week ago. for the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. it's the worst when i'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. i hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. i think i could have permanent hearing damage.

this  guy has been giving me shit since i was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. i've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but i figured some people here might have good info as well. i won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. any info is appreciated. suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but i really don't care about that if i end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. it's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. thanks for any help.

"worlds fastest update - refused dna test (ca). while i was getting my ass handed to me in this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. from what i hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, i don't think they actually took anyone's dna.


many people pointed out that i sounded sketchy in my original post. that was probably true. i'm a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and i did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. i didn't know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so i thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things i never got caught for would come up. if i knew i was just being tested against a baby, i would have said sure.


i want to say that *because* of my past, i'm a squeaky clean employee- i never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an advil from the med cart. we're not supposed to ever be alone with members, and i never am, even if i'm just dropping off a tray in someone's room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. i guess i was acting paranoid because i was pissed about being suspected when i've tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. i hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she's not here anymore, and i don't know what is happening). sorry for the novel, but i wanted to let everyone know what was going on. 


**edit:** i think the reason everyone was so mad at me in the original post was because i was acting like *i* was the victim, even though obviously that was not the case. that is some of that addict mentality, that i'm still working on with my sponsor.",2
"a 15 year old girl made false allegations to cps about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.. my daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. i don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know i was talking about them. 

the girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... she just has delusions of grandeur). the mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

i will refer to the mother as lorrie and the daughter as katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying katy. the assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss katy. i'm not sure if lorrie had anything to do with the cps report but i can not contact her directly. lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. i tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. my daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that katy said and i advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. when the friendship fell apart, katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. my daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

one of the things katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and i remembered it pretty vividly. my daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

a few days ago, cps knocked on our door while i was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. there is no one else who could have made this complaint. it was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. my husband said the cps employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. i wasn't there so i don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

the problem is i have no proof. the assistant principal at my daughter and katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around katy when she made these comments about my son so i might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

what should i do? is there anything i can do? do i even have a leg to stand on? all i have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

any advice is welcome. i'm terrified.

i am in va.

edit: i'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. i just want to clear all of this up and i want katy to be held accountable for making a false report. the things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. the allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. they were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do.",2
"ex girlfriend says she will never stop suing. my boyfriend left his ex-girlfriend almost 2 years ago. they were together for about 5 years with no children together.  they had just purchased a home together in the u.s. and have been going to court for a year and a half over it.  he paid for almost everything,  so the court  said they must sell the house and awarded him a much higher percentage of the proceeds. she appealed on the grounds that the judge was unfair to her as a single mother (she had a 24 year old son)  and although we are still waiting to hear back,  it sounds like the court will probably stand by their original decision.  all this really did was prolong this ordeal. 
she emailed my boyfriend a few days ago and basically told him that because she can't keep the  house, she is going to sue him for multiple reasons after they finish this round. although i don't think she will win anything, we really can't afford to keep paying a lawyer to represent him for another year or two.  he has already paid over 20k and we just can't do this much longer.   
my question is,  can she just sue him over and over? how do we handle this? his lawyer honestly has not been overly helpful.

i've been moved in for about a month and a half - i've heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then i've just chucked it up to being new house sounds. i'll be honest and say i've been too scared to see if anything's up there since i've moved in so i've never even seen the attic. today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so i asked him to check it out. he popped up with a flashlight and there's a tent set up. he came down and told me. my sister and i came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. the back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. we called the cops and waited about ten minutes. once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. cops didn't do anything and didn't even go up to check. they were neato. so i put my head up to check while they were there. it's a tent. there's playing cards. they took my name and left. 

sooo i nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. i was thinking first thing i should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

other than that - do i hire someone to check the house? do i call the cops again another day?  
should i not stay here alone?

"guy tried to pass me and hit oncoming traffic. said he'd sue me since i didn't slow down (ga). edit: finally know everything that has occurred legally. my stepdad has some friends and found out what was reported. after the officer told me i could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. guy told him i sped up and that i was ""mad he was passing me."" said officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. i didn't even think he actually got it) and saw that i already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. so. the officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

my parents are furious and we're just waiting for my day in court because there's no evidence i sped up, there's no dash cam footage that's mysteriously came up, there's nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (i have a speeding ticket but i did my time for it). i was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it's been rainy for a few weeks and i'm also just still paranoid since my first ticket. two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. i guess he didn't look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. i swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. the first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

i moved on from it since i didn't cause the accident and i went on to school. yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying i was being faulted for an accident and that this guy's insurance was coming after me. i was so confused because my car wasn't damaged, i don't need this on my driving record, and so on. my stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because i was supposed to slow down when i saw him passing. 

i have absolutely no idea what to do here. is this a situation where i can tell him to pound sand or should i take it seriously? 

edit: my stepdad called juvie court today and asked what i was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene i spoke to (i told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. he asked to see my license. i didn't see why not. he basically said ""thanks for reporting i'll contact you if i need anything else have a good day"") is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. and the reason he let me go then was because he ""didn't know i could've prevented the accident until further investigation.""

we're even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we'd all just have to wait. i'm guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him i sped up or something. i don't know what to do here because if this sticks, i lose my license until i turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket).

long story short, the distributor scammed us and we didn't get the sweaters. frida was clearly annoyed with us asking about updates, and stopped replying completely to anything related to it. in august 2017 she announced that she had gotten all the money back a while ago, and that we could send her our account numbers and she'd send out the money asap. everyone were relieved and happy. after a few weeks, no one had gotten their money back from her and asked what was going on. one person said she got her money (frida's best friend), but none of the others as i know of. now it's over a year ago and no one's heard anything still, she hasn't posted or replied after she made the original post saying she got the money.

i sent her a pm the other day asking for an update. i said it's fine if she needs more time to do it for whatever reason, that i'm sure everyone's understanding, but that people just want a reply. that the silence is the frustrating part. she has completely ignored it.

what can i do to get my/our money back? i thought about telling her i'll report her for fraud if she doesn't reply or give my money back within two weeks. the report will most likely not result in anything, but maybe it'd push her to repay everyone?

&#x200b;

**edit since i cant reply to people**: thank you all for your advice, it's been really helpful. and you're right, the distributor didn't technically scam us since he did repay us after two years (or earlier if frida had them a while). i do know there was an attempt to get the sweaters since she wasn't the only one working on getting our money back and talking to the distributor, and also because we got pictures of the sweaters at one point.

i'm not going to talk to the folk high school since the nature of the school is that you take one year there basically studying a hobby you have. norwegians often call it a free-year to relax before going to uni, and figuring out what you want to do with your life. since we left that school three years ago i don't think they'd appreciate getting involved. if it was a uni or highschool i would, though.

we are all spread across the country now, but i'll message everyone involved and ask them if they want to take legal action against her, at the same time as i message frida letting her know that if she keeps ignoring us it'll have consequences. hopefully she'll be scared into just repaying us, and if not then i'll follow your legal advice on what to do next. i won't let it go even if she gives me my money back but no one else.

i'm also gonna pop her then-boyfriend a message and ask him what he knows, as he's one of my best friends and might have some intel. ",2
"(update) the exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order. you all thought it over.  so did i.  but no!  turns out this story really could get weirder

recap- years ago i took in an injured stray cat.  the cat was did not have a collar or chip.  a good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. after owning the cat for several years i began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  they demanded i return the cat and i refused and blocked them.  eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  the letters demanded i pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  at this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. i ignored the first two but when they kept arriving i went ahead and did so.  i assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter i received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  this was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

so, to cut this already way too long story short, i filed a police report.  after some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

i will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but i'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  this is honestly the single dumbest thing i've ever gone through.

my cat continues not to care.

"dog died while under sitter's care - story does not add up (los angeles, ca, usa). my fiance and i were out of town for vacation and left our two dogs with a sitter who runs her daycare out of her home (los angeles, ca). we dropped the dogs off on tuesday. the sitter informed us she was going out of town on wednesday but had an alternate sitter lined up who would be staying in her house to cover things from wednesday until her return on saturday. she also tells me about the vet tech who lives in the front of her duplex who she sometimes uses for ""emergencies"". 

today (saturday) i get a frantic voicemail from the sitter stating that my dog had a seizure and wasn't going to make it. i call the vet and they confirm that he was brought in this morning experiencing convulsions, went into cardiac arrest and they could not resuscitate him. he was a perfectly healthy 5/yo dog with no issues whatsoever when i left him. 

i drive home, frantic, and arrive at the vet to say goodbye to my dog, and am told by the vet tech about the ""bite marks"" he was treated for elsewhere and was brought in with - which i immediately explain i know nothing about. they bring out my dog's body, which has a huge bite mark with approximately two dozen stitches on his spine right at the neck/hackles level. i immediately begin calling the original sitter and alternate sitter to find out wtf is going on. 

original sitter finally caves and explains that he was ""attacked at the dog park"" by a ""pit-type dog"" and she did not get the other dog owners info. says that she didn't tell me because she ""didn't want to ruin my vacation and it was no big deal"". i ask the alternate sitter if the original sitter told her to lie to me and her answer was a ""no....yes... kind of"" and then she proceeds to tell me that original sitter didn't want to ""ruin my trip"" and so asked she and her boyfriend not to tell me, and they felt conflicted but ultimately followed her wishes. 

i wait for original sitter to get back to town. while outside i confront the vet tech who lives in the front of the duplex asking if he knew anything of what happened to my dog, which he denied. while waiting for original sitter to show up fiance overhears the vet tech make a phone call saying ""original sitter told people we've been working together and i don't normally do this kind of stuff but i could lose my job"" - moments later a woman pulls up to his house, enters, carries out a pink duvet from his home, and puts it in her trunk and drives away. 

original sitter gets home and when questioned about a vet receipt for the stitches, gives me a photo taken of a printed receipt that shows services were rendered for the 29th - a day after she was already out of town - and that the credit card charge was entered manually. she cannot provide a physical copy of the receipt and the medications she says they provided my dog (i have the bottles) do not match the medications on the photo of the receipt she gave me. 

she tries to say it must have been a ""brain disease"" and that the dog bite had nothing to do with it... but the vet i spoke with who treated my dog for the seizures said that a) a healthy five year old dog should have survived a seizure so likely it was a bacterial infection that caused it, potentially from the bite; b) my dog should have been held for 24 hour observation after the bite/anesthesia/stitches

it seems to my like the original sitter's story is not adding up and i'm wondering if she didn't have her vet tech friend perform some sort of illegal, back yard surgery to stitch up my dog and then have someone forge the receipt. what can i legally do here to get to the bottom of this situation, and what sort of case do i have against her? i don't even care about the money because it won't bring my dog back, but i want to make sure she is never allowed to do this to someone else.",2
"ended up in the er after an accident at work, my boss is lying to me to me and playing stupid. turns out she does not have wc and may not even have a business license.. i work a landscaping design job in florida. we're paid with a handwritten check and under-the-table. i got a long splinter under my fingernail all the way to the end of the nail bed while pulling weeds on the job. it was only my 5th shift (although second week) working there. i ended up having to go to the er to get it surgically removed, lots of fun getting multiple shots in my finger.

after searching a few state databases, the only business license she has under her name is one for real estate, and no record of workers comp coverage. looking back on it, i think the hospital staff discovered this as well but were going to let me figure that out. 


is there anything i can do about this, or am i just stuck with the bill?",2
"ia my father left my 3y/o daughter about $500k in a trust, ex-husband (who lives in mn) wants to use the trust funds for living expenses. my father left my daughter, who is 3, about $500k in a trust. the trustee is not a family member, but a professional trustee. my daughter is supposed to begin receiving the money at 25, but they explained that they have the power to dispense money early for the right circumstances, like a private school or medical bills - or, as they very loosely and briefly mentioned, basic living costs in an emergency hardship situation. they gave an example that if i were to become ill and unable to work, the trust could provide some level of assistance to ensure my daughter does has food on her plate and a roof over her head. however this was glossed over pretty quickly and i don't know the technical details.

about two months ago my ex husband quit his job because he said they are unwilling to be flexible with him for his debilitating migraines (his employer told me that he claims to have migraines but has never actually seen a doctor about them for treatment), and says he has been unable to find a new job and intends to instead pursue getting on disability, but expects that to take 2-3 years. he says that he will soon lose his apartment. he is unable to receive most government-based assistance because he scammed the system last year (lied about income to receive food assistance for which he was not qualified and got caught).

so, he has now approached the trustee and wants to use the trust money to pay for an apartment, utilities and a car until he is approved for disability. i was especially surprised about the car portion - he says he needs money to purchase a safer vehicle because his vehicle is old, rated poorly for crashes and does not have working seatbelts (which is a surprise to me - just a few weeks ago i buckled her into the back seat when he picked her up, so not sure what exactly he is claiming there).

i disagree with this use of the funds, particularly because he only has her for 6 days per month. i understood the ability to use the trust for living expenses should be limited to scenarios in which she is genuinely in danger of being homeless or neglected, and that is not the case as i provide everything she needs now and can do so all the time if he is unable to. my father intended the money to provide her with opportunities once she is old enough to use it wisely, not to facilitate my husband's visitation in our custody agreement.

since my ex husband has a history of committing fraud when receiving government assistance and also a history of faking illness (he lied to a previous employer to receive paid time off work claiming he was being treated for cancer when he was not), i do not trust that his intentions here are genuine. i suspect he sees the trust as a way that he can get free money so that he doesn't have to get another job.

anyhow, my question: since the trust is for the benefit of my daughter and she is obviously a minor, what can i do to ensure it is protected? should i assume that the trustee has her interests in mind and will not prematurely release money for something like this, or does it sound like there is real danger that he will drain the trust? is it possible for me to hire a lawyer to argue that the money should be saved for her later in life unless the circumstances are truly dire? i'm not sure if i can actually hire a lawyer and get them involved because i am not the trustee, the company is.

"my neighbor wants me to sell my house to his friend at much less than market value. he has threatened to ""scare away"" anyone else i show the house to.. i'm moving soon and need to sell my house. when my neighbor found out about this he had one of his friends take a look at it and he made me an offer far below what i would expect to get.

after i turned it down he became agitated. since then he's been making thinly veiled threats about how he'll approach anyone else who sees the house and ""tell them all about the house in the interest of full disclosure"". he stressed the word ""all"" which leads me to believe he'll make up some pretty grandiose stories.

i can only conclude that he's expecting to get a cut from getting his friend the house at an extremely low price. are there any laws against this? do i have any legal recourse if he follows through with his threats?

"update someone i've never met claims they own my house.  hi everyone –
 
i can't thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: ""someone i've never met claims they own my house"".  this is the first update, and i'm hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  this is what has happened since my last post:
 

after the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they'd been alerted to the lis pendens and could also represent us.  we were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  they said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. we hung up.
 

we looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner's title insurance (yay!).  our deed is a ""bargain and sale"" deed, for those wondering. we also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  the last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  i signed up on acris to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  i also emailed the da for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  i gave it to him, but he hasn't called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
my husband met with our lawyer this morning, and i asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the lis pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  according to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  our lawyer called their law firm and basically said ""where is the deed?""  they supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we're starting to think they don't have it, and never did!  they may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who's like ""yeah, i totally own that place.  i even have a deed for it.  no, you can't see it.""  it's possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

in addition, it's not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn't been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 years ago and there is still no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (i was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them ""you have no grounds for this.  take it off.""
 

the attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on friday.  i am hopeful that it will just be a matter of ""take the lis pendens off."" and ""ok"".  i'll update again after the call between the lawyers. i told my husband the number 1 question is ""where. is. the. deed?""  when we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason i was freaking out. i honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  if they give us a hard time about removing the lis pendens, then we'll see.
 

so far my takeaway from this that i would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  and just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that's like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but i'm not bitter……).
 

thank you all so much for your help,  i'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude.",2

thank you to everyone who shared their advice.  i contacted my hoi and the representative laughed at the fact that we were getting sued.  long story short she said not to worry and they would handle it.  i contacted a few lawyers in my family and they said the neighbors have no bounds to sue since trampolines are apparently illegal in my town.

turns out the neighbors do not own the house and that they rent it, the owner and landlord of that house was miffed since he is the one that will have to pay the fines for the trampoline.  turns out that the renters don't have renters insurance (which is why they asked for a cash payment from me). last i heard was that the landlord gave them a 30 day notice.  as for me?  i'm buying exterior cameras so this doesn't happen anymore.",2
"my truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. wa state. my truck ('87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid october. i immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

fast forward to last friday, i receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... on november 1! six weeks prior! from my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

i called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. a later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which i would think is illegal. apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but i had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. i had no idea it had even been recovered!

all i really want is my truck back, which i don't think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. am i entitled to compensation? and from whom? the towing company sold it before it's stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. do i have legal recourse here?

i have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their ""complaint hotline"" until tomorrow. same situation with the towing company.

i was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. i am a senior and about to graduate. they reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. they only gave me info for one class. then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. and another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. despite this i am still ""under investigation"".

"won $2000 scholarship from a gaming tournament while i was in high school. they said i had to wait until college to receive the money. the organization is shutting down. can i do anything to still receive my money?. **location:** i live in rockville, maryland, and the organization is based in rowland heights, california (i believe)

i only started college this year, but after contacting them about the money they have almost completely ignored me. they gave me vague answers about how they'll get this sorted out ""by the end of the school year"" (wtf?). i suspect that the organization has run out of money and is shutting down. their website is no longer up, and they are no longer running their yearly high school tournament.

there was no written contract, but the money was promised. they also made a facebook post after the tournament saying ""congratulations to this team (mine) for winning $2000 each in scholarship money!"", and included a photo.

thanks in advance! this is a massive amount of money for me (broke college student) so any advice is greatly appreciated!

last monday i went to collect my refill of my medication, they weren't able to fully fill the full balance so instead provided me with a weeks worth of my medication, and told me to collect the balance on the following day.

on wednesday evening i went in to collect my balance, only for the pharmacy technician to tell me she could not find my prescription. after taking my information she told me that i had already collected my remaining balance tuesday afternoon. i denied me ever doing this, and was told she could not help me and i would need to come in thursday morning to talk to head pharmacist to explain the situation.

thursday morning i went and talked to the head pharmacist who:

* insisted that i already collected my remaining balance. which i denied repeatedly.
* i told her to confirm via their security cameras that it was not me collecting the medication, which she did. 
* now repeatedly insisted that i allowed someone else to collect my remaining balance. i told her i have no one allowed to do that on my file, except my parents. who neither of them is alive anymore. 
* unfortunately she told me she could not help me further, and i need to report my medication as stolen. which i refused to do, because i never received my balance, and i felt that would be me admitting fault on my part.
* i called my doctor and explained my situation, and he immediately called the pharmacy. the head pharmacy tech told him that they dispensed my prescription to me. he told me unfortunately he cannot re-issue me my prescription, unless the pharmacy admits wrong doing. 
* the head pharmacist basically told me she could do nothing for me, and asked me to leave or security would be called.

i went home and called the corporate number of the pharmacy, and explained everything to them. they agreed to open an investigation however told me this could take well over a month to get a result, they gave me a case number, and recommended that i make alternative arrangements with my doctor. 

on friday i called my doctor again, and explained everything one more time, he was sympathetic however he told me he cannot re-issue my prescription unless the pharmacy admits they screwed up because it is a controlled substance.

"(update) cease and desist letter after posting a review on yt and tricked by developer for address/name. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z5mms/i_do_reviews_i_reveiced_a_cease_and_desist_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

so it's been an interesting two months, after my post i started contacting a few attorneys locally and eventually had to call the state bar for a referral because of the type of possible laws not a lot of people handle that like a normal lawyer does that's usually family/criminal.

i finally found an attorney that understood what i was talking about and wanted a link to the reddit post and agreed with the majority of the top advice i received. 

he accepted a small retainer of $250 to respond to the cease and desist i received and a few possible future letters/calls.

he responded asking them exactly what statements i made that were false and requested exact times in the video that the statements were made. since i previously privated the video we had to give them a different link. 

he also outlined what will happen should they continue stating that during discovery he will be requesting all communication between qa, play testing, developers, and management to see if they were aware of any of these bugs/issues that may compromise a customer's experience while playing etc.

it also included a paragraph basically calling them out for reaching out to me and lying about ""swag and wanting feedback"" to get my information to send a cease and desist instead of going through the proper legal channels to obtain this and the fact that i still have yet to receive any ""swag"" that this is clearly the case.

also included that they need to preserve all the emails they sent to other reviewers because it's of interest in the possible upcoming legal action. he also requested they preserve all sorts or other communication between qa, developers etc.

so after he had confirmed receipt of the letter we waited and waited. nothing for about a month but then i received 3 large boxes containing games, posters, statues, a custom ps4 limited edition console, bobble heads, funko pops, just every piece of swag i think they have for 3-4 of their games and a letter saying ""sorry it took so long for us to get this swag out to you!""

my attorney then sent out another letter asking about the status and their position on the cease and desist and we received a letter back with only a few sentences basically saying they made a mistake and we can expect no further correspondence on the matter and that the video can be reinstated if we so wish. 

he sent out another asking about the lost ad revenue due to me having to private the video since they admitted it was a mistake. they sent out a check for $500 and some papers i needed to sign basically saying the issue is over and i won't sue them.

thank you la, i didn't get sued and after it all i came out ahead. i'm still not going to link my channel or the video or name the company in question but thanks for all your help!",2
"rear ended by a cop who pressured me not to report it ma. this is happening right now. i work at a dog daycare and was driving a group of pups back from the dog park, going the speed limit, when a car bumped into me. turns out it was an unmarked police vehicle. since i'm at work, i asked if i could just photograph his insurance information and file a claim later. he said that since he's police i would need to stay and wait to file an accident report. 

he kept emphasizing that this would be a long process, that the damage wasn't that severe, and that i should let it go. he also tried to accuse me of speeding, which i wasn't—this happened maybe 50 yards past a crosswalk at which i had stopped, so i don't even think it's possible for me to have been speeding unless i had floored it. it made me uncomfortable that he was so adamant about me not filing a report, like maybe this isn't his first accident, so i went ahead with filing it.

what should i expect to happen next? is it true that he wasn't able to just give me his insurance so i could have moved on with my day? can he make this out to be my fault somehow? am i owed any compensation from him personally or from the police department for the rest of my shift i'm likely going to miss?",2
"update they removed all the cats from my mom's house.. animal control and the police were called, and it took them until today to get here. over the weekend i took my mother to a hotel, and she said she was happy that i cleaned up for some mother-daughter time. she also thanked me for getting her a new bed. she couldn't comprehend that we weren't in her house.

do i need to go ahead and continue to gather evidence of the hours and volume then retain a civil attorney? is this something i can take before the judge myself since even the police here have said they are flagrantly disregarding the law but can only ask them to turn it down?",2
"my sister abandoned our autistic brother with me. now 6 months later finally admitted that she won't be resuming custody, and has told me he is now ""my problem"" as she won't be coming back to canada. is this legal..?. i am in **ontario, canada** while my sister was in vancouver bc.

my brother is on the spectrum, and he is someone who basically needs constant and around the clock care. he is in his 20's now, but mentally he is about \~8 years old.

nearly a year ago my mom suddenly passed away due to a blood clot in the brain, it came out of nowhere and shocked our family and my dad passed a few years back from cancer. 3 years ago our mom had a will drawn up, and my older sister basically agreed in the event of something happening she would be responsible for my brother (there were a ton of reasons for this specifically the fact she lived within my brothers support network, while i am far away). in agreement with this my mom put aside a large amount of money for the purpose of my brothers well being.

my sister and her fiancee took my brother in for about 6 months, but it became very apparent that she misunderstood the amount of work required for his care. she asked if i would be willing to take him for a month or so while she went and took time off. i agreed simply because of the fact i am now a stay at home mom, but told her i couldn't do this for long.

one month turned into two, and then finally 4. she kept making excuse after excuse, but she finally agreed that she would take him when they got back from a vacation in europe to visit her fiancee's family. when she got back she would let me know. then basically nothing, absolutely fucking nothing for two months. never responded to any of my emails, messages or phone calls.

finally yesterday i received a long facebook message from her telling me:

* she isn't coming back to canada, as she has decided to get married in europe and live there with her fiancee.
* she isn't coming back for my brother, and said i needed to take care of him as he is now ""my problem"".
* she said she was sorry but she couldn't deal with him anymore.

she has blocked me on facebook, and her cell phone number no longer seems to work anymore.

i know this sounds cold, but i can't do this. i can't take care of my brother anymore. on top of this all the money that my parents put aside for my brother, aside from a bit she sent me early on i have no idea where that money is or where it went.

i have tried a variety of services, and explained my situation about my brother, but i have discovered there is basically fuck all help for me. i was told it could take several years to find a place for him in a care facility, and it is just wait list after wait list.

so like my question is, can my sister really just abandon him like this? isn't there some sort of law against basically abandoning someone your responsible for? i know he isn't a child anymore, but mentally he is.

to clarify a few things, i love my brother, but he is far too much for me to handle and my toddler. we have been struggling to make ends meet financially, with the increased upkeep cost. to the point where i worry for our future. i can't leave my brother alone, so i working is out of the question.

"purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. now what? ny, putnam county. mostly what's in the title. condo was vacant for roughly 60 days between closing and our attempt to move in. upon getting there with our belongings, we discovered a new deadbolt on the door - the unit was vacant and had no deadbolt when we did our final walkthrough the day before closing. tried knocking on the door. got no answer, reached out to our realtor, who contacted the seller's agent and asked that he get in touch with his client to find out what the hell is going on, but at this point we assumed squatters. about an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. all $1 of it. he told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. the police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. the condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as i plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

to me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but i am nowhere near a lawyer. to that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but i am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

i have no idea what to do here. luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. unluckily, my wife and i turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

i'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. beyond that, do i have grounds to evict him? if so, how do i recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? does the tenant have any sort of liability here? if i do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can i sue the seller for that as well? what about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? is there anything else that i am not thinking of?

i am shaking with anger right now so i apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

edit: location is new york, specifically putnam county.

**update (4:45pm):** i just got a call from my attorney's admin. he's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me. apparently he was a civil litigator before he ""retired"" to real estate law, and she thinks he'll welcome an excuse to step into his old shoes and tear these people apart. needless to say i am looking forward to hearing from him.

**update 2 (5:25pm):** just heard from both my realtor and my attorney. the evening seems to have found a way to get even more interesting, but the truck owning friend is about five minutes out with my car. we're going to meet my realtor for dinner, my closing documents and some badly needed drinks (said the guy who doesn't really drink). i'll update tomorrow morning if not tonight, but till then... thank you thank you thank you for the advice and reassurance. wish me luck!",2
"pretty sure the 16 year old who lives above us is living alone. is this neglect?. single mom and her daughter live above us (in ct). the daughter is a music student and we constantly have to hear her playing guitar or keyboard with an amp, singing (more like screeching) into a microphone, and producing shitty beats with too much base. 

she plays music way louder than she needs to to practice. its louder than our tv much of the time. her mother usually leaves every night before 8 (if she has been home at all that day) and comes home in the morning to (presumably) shower and then go to work. mother might be home 1 or 2 nights per week.

her daughter obviously takes advantage of this and has friends over. they are so loud some nights that they are clearly drunk. other nights she will sing into a microphone until midnight. they wake us up all hours of the night on weekends and weekdays. the mother complains to us that her apartment smells like weed ""all the time"" and blames it on us, since we are below her. preeeeeetty sure it's her own kid, though, because we don't smoke in or around the house. 

so this kid basically lives along with very little supervision. is this legal? should we get cops involved? we've been hesitant because we fear retaliation, but can't stand this anymore and need to do something!",2
"tx - update. i informed the father of his possible two kids who are married to each other.. met up with him after work and got right down to it. i informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that i have a very good idea of who it was. 

he did not take the news well when i told him his son in law was probably his son. lots of screaming. lots of blaming me. eventually lots of apologizing to me. i told him i would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. i told him to get a dna test done and that i would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a dna test being done first to prove it. he agreed this was a good idea. his thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. i told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

i told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a dna test proving parentage. 

he agreed without any hesitation. 

so now its a waiting game. the lab i use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. the dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. i did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

"update: today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. delaware, usa

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

i found the fence on thursday. saturday i was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. so on friday morning, i had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. i called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

i took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

i also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. if i find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, i'll be informing the police.

so, on friday afternoon, i removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which i put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. saturday, sunday, and monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

we still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now i don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. i will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if i learn who built the fence i will be sure to update again!",2

"update - ontario - people are living in our just built town home claiming they are renting but will leave for only ""$15k"". police are not being helpful, what am i supposed to do here?. i posted this last weekend.  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c0f7ep/ontario\_people\_are\_living\_in\_our\_just\_built\_town/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c0f7ep/ontario_people_are_living_in_our_just_built_town/) 

today they were forcefully removed from the property by the police. our lawyer was somehow able to get a judge to look at everything and approve having them removed. the police officer basically told us to not move in and have the entire house professionally cleaned, as there is a bunch of needles and other things laying around.

on top of all that it seems they tried to seemingly destroy everything in our house. all the new appliances that came with our house are basically ruined, all toilets, and bathtubs seemingly look like they have been smashed with a hammer. in some places it looks like someone tried to rip the fucking wiring out of our walls, etc. basically our house i guess basically as a final fuck you to us.

our lawyer has basically told us the odds of us getting anything of value out of them is basically nil. i wanted them to go to jail for breaking and entering but apparently it doesn't work like that.

today her mom came and told me that it's a actually assault to cut a minor's hair without parental consent and she's going to sue me for $10,000 for destroying her daughter's beautiful hair. the whole assault thing sounds like bullshit as boys under 18 come in all the time on their own and get haircuts.

"i purchased a vehicle and was assaulted by the salesmen when i went to pick it up several days later. what type of lawyer should i contact? additional details in post. a bit of a doozy...

i purchased a car saturday in massachusetts. i paid 10k in a bankers check and financed the remainder. upon pickup on tuesday,  i was told i was given a rebate (which was not in any of my paperwork) that i was not entitled to. the dealership told me i need to pay $500 or else i can't have the vehicle. at this point, i already had a contract, the keys to the vehicle, had the vehicle insured, signed over the title to my old vehicle...everything i needed aside from registration. as far as i was concerned it was my property at the time. after a verbal back and forth the salesman got tough and told me to back down or he would f me up etc etc. after threatening me, i told him he couldn't do that. he then rushed me and violently pushed me . at that point, for my own safety, i tackled him and we were separated by all the other employees. during the separation he hit me several more times because i was the only individual restrained by the other employees. the other employees collected my paperwork that was lost in the altercatiin and shredded it. the police were called and i filed a report. i have yet to request the police press charges. i declined to initially because after the altercation they had possession of my $10k, my new car and the title to my old car. i had no paperwork other thank the bankers check made to and cashed by the company, and an autopolocy with associated vin.  police told me they couldn't help with the civil side regarding the cars and money, only the assault. if i requested the charges be pressed i couldn't help but think i would have been out that money and both cars for a long time as the civil thing plays out.  i sustained a potentially broken nose and a medium cut to the knee... and what sucked the most for me...the brand new watch, which my wife gave me little more than 3 weeks ago as a gift on our wedding day...is destroyed. had little luck finding a local attorney that would specialise in some of these types of civil claims",2

"update-i need more help. my ex deleted my ba thesis and it's due in 7 days. i need additional help. based on the advice from my last thread i took my laptop to the geek squad to recover the files. they said i'd have it back by the end of the week. that would leave me with enough time to finish the last section of my thesis paper. 

i got a call yesterday that it would actually take 2 weeks because they had to ship my laptop out for data recovery. tried to explain that was unacceptable but nothing could be done about it. 

i'm not looking for technical advice. i need legal advice that i can use for my college and ex. my advisor said he can't give me an extension, which means i won't graduate next month and very likely could just fail out. is there any legal basis for forcing my school to give me an extension? my paper and all of my qualitative data was deleted. plus my backups were deleted. this whole situation is beyond my control. 

is there any action i can take against my ex?

texted my ex later on monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn't hear back. her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. she did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous.

"roommate flushed an expensive family heirloom down the toilet.. so i'm a sophomore in college and have been living with a randomly paired roommate who i believe has some form of special needs. if the room is messy he gets into some serious anger fits where he will scream and yell at me about not cleaning up and then proceed to throw all of my stuff around the room. this lasts around 20 minutes and he always apologises profusely and cleans everything up and says it won't happen again. 

just yesterday he had another crazy anger fit and took my watch off my desk and flushed it down the toilet and proceeded to scream hysterically. the watch was quite an expensive rolex passed down from my father from his father so it has a lot of significance within the family. i've tried calling the school and sewage system but i've had no luck yet in retrieving it. 

i have moved rooms and spoken to the ra but they have not really offered any significant advice. i have not spoken to my roommate yet as i am both too angry and scared to approach him. i have not spoken to my father yet as i know it will complete devastate him. 

i honestly have no idea how to approach this and any help would be appreciate it. what's the best course of action here?

"update me / ca my teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.. well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. christ.

yesterday afternoon, after i made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), i called her gynecologist. (i have uterine issues so i got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

she was very understanding, and offered to stay late if i wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. so, i called the police, let them know i was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

my daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when i explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

the doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the sti tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. though i know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, i'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

after the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. he sat down with my daughter in our living room, while i hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear i'd hear it.)

the detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in maine i needed to speak to. i made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. he left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. he also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

after he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that i make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. i told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

this morning, i got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. his assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in ca, the custody arrangement is in ca, and it will be amended in ca (since ca is her state of residency), and in ca they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. he also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she had to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

i have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that i could help her as needed. right now she's mostly been playing world of warcraft and eating junk food, but i feel like at least right now i'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

i want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. i will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.",2
"apartment complex installed ""smarthome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. what are my options? colorado. i got a notice via email a while back that the apartment complex where i live in denver was going to be installing ""smarthome"" devices in my apartment. i didn't respond because i assumed i would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  i was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while i was traveling for work. 

now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying i requested this and asking that i consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, i am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if i do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""you have requested that we provide insert name of smartdevice vendor in your unit. we agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

i did not request this.

`""information collected by insert name of smartdevice venor (""information""): we have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""personal information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. front door lock:- entry activity by time and code used- technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

this language is pretty much the same for thermostat, smartplugs and switches, hub, water sensor and software to use it all.

`""information sharing: anonymized and aggregated information collected by the service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if i lose or damage any of them, i am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""if a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

what are my options? i really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but i also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that i did not want or consent to being installed.

"update does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? oregon. previous post a month ago over here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9g6uwn/does_a_child_who_didnt_see_one_parent_because_the/).

i'm safe, and i'm out.

i organised a place to stay with a coworker. i have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. my dad has some regular sport meetings on saturdays that go for hours so i prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. i've been approved for a rental and i move there soon.

i contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when i told them he'd been telling me i couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

i took copies of all of his paperwork too because while i was getting ready to move i found most of what i knew about my parents separating was a lie. there was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. my dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when i was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. he's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when i'm 21. some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. i think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. i did not find the letter i read when i was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

after i moved out my dad did try to contact the police. they came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say i couldn't look after myself. his words were that i was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

i've been back to canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. we're still working out the details with a canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but i have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people i remember. they were really worried about me when i went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

"new york - i've been visited by cps 8 times, to enquire about a child i don't have. at what point it becomes harassment or stalking?. there's a cps agent that seems to be convinced that i have a child and i'm locking the child in my home. first time i was visited, i was very understanding. i allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. everything seemed fine. obviously no child and no evidence of one, because i don't have a child.

this was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until i stopped cooperating. i told her that from now on the only way i'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. a few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. the officer told me that it will be a lot easier if i allowed them to look at my house, i allowed the officer to do that by himself. again, no child was found. his search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times i have refused to talk to her. once, as i left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. it definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. i called the police but it went nowhere. i have called the cps office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. this last incident happened this last thursday.

this woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. everyone has told her that i don't have a child. 

this definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. if this was a legitimate cps operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, i'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance i guess? but they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. so maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

this is really going too far and is affecting my life. i actually fear for my safety now. i will install security cameras this week and will call the police if i found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the cps.

do i have a legal recourse here? like filing a restraining order against the cps (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? this definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. not sure how stalking is defined legally. what's the best way to stop her?

"update nc sold them a used car, now they sued me.. a lot of stress was lifted from our shoulders today, thankfully. 

original post here(https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

this morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. the plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn't disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn't driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

we presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. anything they found after they took ownership wasn't our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. we brought up the ftc's private sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are ""as-is"" unless otherwise stated. we neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

long story short, the magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the plaintiff  because nc is a ""buyer beware state"" and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. they have 10 days to appeal, but i doubt that's gonna happen. 

thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and i more information on the original post. it sure helped!

tl;dr: magistrate heard the case, dismissed it because the buyer should have done more to inspect the vehicle.

"hunters shot house again, broke window. my parents live in a rural area and are surrounded by woodlands that they do not own. a couple years back a hunter shot in the direction of the house and broke a window. the cops came out, the hunter apologized and paid for the window, but nothing really came of it.

now it's happened again (different window, same scenario, possibly different hunters-not sure). the hunters are friends of the guy who owns the land, and the owner is upset (as he is also friends with my parents), but i feel like that isn't enough. what can/should be done?

"i went on a 20 day trip. i came back to find squatters in my home. they (falsely) claim to have been there for 6 weeks. do they have tenants' rights?. i own a house in orange county, california. i went abroad for 20 days. when i got home at the end of that trip, i found my locks had been changed and someone else's car was in my driveway.

i called the police. that led to an argument with the people (at least 2 adults) occupying my house. they told the police they'd been there for 6 weeks. i explained i knew that to be untrue because i was only gone for 20 days. at the end, the officers said it's a civil matter and left.

so basically, these people have been in my house for no more than 20 days, but they claim to have been there for long enough to be tenants. do i need to treat them as tenants?",2
"a bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back.. basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. my account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


i went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. he said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. i get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but i said i still wanted to press charges. the officer said i literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

so i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

i was refunded the 5k to my account, but now i have a shit load of overdraft fees because i use paypal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, hbo, etc.) every time paypal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. i've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but i only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. i do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and i can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. every time i check my account, it's just further in the negative and i don't know what to do.

"parents took $6000 from me without my consent. resulted in homelessness and prevented university education.. i live in alberta, canada. about a year and a half ago, my family got a huge surprise from my great grandfather, who gave us each $5000 with the exception of my mother. i was 17 at the time, and my mother and uncle went to the bank with me to set up a joint account between me and my uncle since my great grandfather wrote the cheques in both mine and his name for some reason.

my father, who was an alcoholic at the time, stated that it would be best that all of the bank cards of the newly created accounts be in his and my mothers hands so that we wouldnt make reckless purchases. at the time, i didnt mind since i was planning to save the money for university, but the main reason i gave the card to them was because my father was not one to cross. hes done things to me in the past, and ive been scared of him since.

all was fine until a couple months later when i decided to pitch into my savings with my job, only to find that the $5000 was gone through multiple purchases.

the tap function was on the card.

i confronted my mother immediately, away from my father, and she agreed to pay back $400 a month. however, this only happened for three months. around the same time this started, my great grandfather, unaware of what happened, sent another $5000. due to a plane ticket i bought to see my gf this august as well as a $500 slash to my paycheque, i was left with about $1000. however, after we transferred the money into my brothers account to keep my father as calm and stable as possible, his account was locked, my mother refusing to open the account.

i burst under the pressure, and was given the boot. while i was in the homeless shelter, i kept asking for the $1000 back to get shelter to find my mother already unlocked the account and gave it to my father. 

i had to drop my classes in high school right before the diplomas because of this. i was unable to get a credit card approved by the bank for application because of the ridiculous transactions, and found that my great grandfather was going to send another $10,000 before he learned of what my parents did. a couple months later, i was let back in, but now theyre telling me ""its gone, money is the root of all evil"". 

i lost my girlfriend after cancelling the trip, lost my university aspirations, and lost much more that id rather not reveal here. what should i do? 

update: after seeing all of the suggestions here and seeing just how many people apparently have my back, i decided to leave the house and go back to the youth shelter while i get myself a lawyer and gather the necessary evidence. thank you all, i never thought this would blow up like this when i went to sleep last night. knowing a couple thousand strangers have my back seems to give me more courage to go about with this action than i did before.

you see, i have about $650-700 in known debt right now, and they're asking me to pay $250 a month for a room even worse than the unfinished basement i was sleeping in before, and giving my mattress away, as i found out just now during the moving preparations. it's still $500 cheaper than the room i paid for per month after getting out of the shelter at my friend's place, but it doesn't feel right, especially with how they're consistently acting as if what they did was nothing. if you guys have any more advice, i'll be sure to take it and update you all with the situation.

 i used the property records to hunt down their main office in houston(i live in dallas) and forwarded them the same email outlining all the ways they had violated my lease that i had sent to the taa, the city, as well as the apparently pointless (thanks, guys) bbb.

the guy there got me set up with the online payment system that they actually do have, contrary to what the office manager here told me. next month i can just pay online!

he went through my account, got it paid, and refunded me $125 in late fees as a credit. i actually overpaid $5, still, but it's mostly a win without having to go to court.

"i'm being sued by the at fault driver who doesn't know i have dash cam footage. hello, 

i got hit in brampton, ontario in october 2018. 

i'll try to keep it short! last october a driver ran a red light while she was making a left hand turn  (in a 2 lane left turning street) and hit me as i started going through the green. 

i called 911 but no one came because no one was injured so we got towed to the police station and made reports. no one got charged with anything, even though she should have imo. they didn't ask questions or care. no ambulance came, no major injuries. 

the insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as i was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). no issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that's it i moved on. 

fast forward about 5 months and i received mail that i believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what i believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. it doesn't make any sense as she wrote ""he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light"" 

the funny thing is, i don't think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. this footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as i'm moving forward at the green. all very clear on the footage. 

my question is, how can she sue if she's at fault? i'm sure i'll win a case with the footage i have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? that's what i'm most worried about. 

any thoughts on this situation is helpful.

"update: neighbor touched my son.   

original post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor\_touched\_my\_son\_nj/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor_touched_my_son_nj/)

i know the original post didn't get a lot of attention and there probably isn't much demand for an update, but i did want to thank the people who commented and maybe give some guidance on expectations for anybody who might have the horrible luck to fall into a similar situation. also it's just not something we want to talk about with friends/family…. so call it therapy for me.

&#x200b;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

tldr for the 1st post: last monday, soon after i left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200b;

update: on tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. my wife and i interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. after that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

an hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and i to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. the detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

from there we went home.

that afternoon, neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. i opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. soon after i went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. when i got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

for the most part, wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. we did not see neighbor all day. wednesday night, we came to know why. a detective called to let us know neighbor had been taken into custody on tuesday night (while i was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (i assume arraignment).

thursday morning a woman from the state dcf/cp&p office came to the house. she made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & i together. to my mind, this was actually a good thing.  she was able to let us know that neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (i don't recall exactly what they are). she also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in california.

2 – neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on tuesday evening.

from there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. we will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

while she was there i asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if neighbor was likely to be free again soon. she was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. she informed us that neighbor's hearing was set for monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. she wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have neighbor remain in custody.

here's the thing. neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. i advised the detective that we were ok with neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. she confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. we agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom neighbor lives should have input.

that brings us up to date and, to be honest, i am torn. i hate what this man did. i hate that it has happened before, and i never want it to happen again. with that said, at first i was unsure as to whether or not neighbor even knew what he did. he clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. but he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. as he admitted the act to the arresting detective. i get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute lennie from of mice & men, and that tears my heart out. i don't think he really understands, and i don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. at the same time, he touched my son. if there were no clear impairment, i would want to take a baseball bat to his head. but there is, and instead i just feel like shit for everyone involved. this sucks, full stop.

on a more selfish note, the megan's law registry. there are a handful of homes for sale in the area. until now, my wife and i were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. that hope is now over. because neighbor's history all predates mega's law, he was not on the registry. now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. i realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. to repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

sorry for the book, and if the mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, i understand. honestly, i just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

thanks to anyone who reads through.",2
"i'm a pedestrian who waved in an suv in a narrow gap and he got into an accident and he's threatening to sue me.. this happened a few days ago. i live in philly and i was walking along a busy street and i see this suv at a one-way narrow street waiting to move forward at a green light. there is a small car ahead of him that's turning right. the suv wasn't moving past the car because he thought he didn't have enough room. i saw that he did and i just gave him a thumbs up that he can go. he ended up hitting the other car (he was trying to avoid the curb i guess and turned at the last second). 

they got into a bit of an argument and shared info and decided to call the police to make a claim i think. i didn't really listen but the other guy (in the small car) asked me to hang back and provide a witness in case he needs it since i saw the whole thing. they both shared each others insurance and id.

the suv guy asked me for my id for witness too for his insurance claim. soon after he took a picture of my id on his phone he said i was the reason he moved and that he will have to make a claim against me. he is threatening to sue me and said that he would rather just send me the damage bill of both of the cars. i felt bad because i gave him the thumbs up that there was room but he did turn at the last second. the other guy was also annoyed that i shouldn't have told him to go. 

he called and left a vm that i need to act soon because if he makes a claim in a court it would lead to a lot of legal fees for both of us or something. he said that if i agree to pay i can just pay half of the damages.

i'm worried that it's going to be a huge amount and i don't want to go to court. if it goes to court will i have my credit ruined? sorry i don't know too much legal stuff!

"manitoba, canada (update) my cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""lights out by 10pm"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.. previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

my cousin and i want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. he couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. thank you so much! this situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

now for the update: my cousin is moving out this weekend. he spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. the landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. my cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. after an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. the landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for june, july, and august, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. my cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. he is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with james ever again.

while my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. he was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. my cousin and i honestly feel bad for james as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

and that is it. thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. take care, you beautiful people.

edit: since i'm getting nasty messages, i figured i should edit this to let everyone know that i have finally convinced my cousin to report him. he will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is saturday. we are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of june 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

there you go folks. please stop insulting my cousin and i.",2

"private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep (fl). purchased 30 acres of land and built a house several years back in central florida, had a driveway installed that cuts across the center of my property allowing me to exit on either of two main roads.

i now have traffic using my driveway as a shortcut between the two roads up to and including 18 wheelers and other large vehicles since using my driveway cuts off nearly half an hour of travel time between two cities.

i installed pillars and gates on both ends of the driveway and marked it private property but the gates were torn down and the pillars knocked over.

i have contacted the county about it and they sent out a guy from code compliance who looked around for a few minutes and left.

i have now received a notice about not keeping the roadway to state standards and that the county will be out to perform maintenance bringing the roadway up to standards, ie. widening it and repaving which i will be personally responsible for paying for.

ive told them if they want it to be a public road then fine buy me out and ill move elsewhere but they refuse to do so.

as of right now i have removed half the driveway past my house and put up signs and markers stating dead end road and now the county is threatening to have me arrested for destruction of public property.

before anyone asks, no, there are no easements on this property anywhere near the area the driveway goes through and no easements in any form that travel in that direction on the property, closest thing is a power company easement along the southern edge of the land.

"mn: someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.. this past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard. they had been there for a bit when i let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously i wouldn't have done so). my dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). i coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck.

last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. i can only imagine where he will be going with this.

i know i need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now i'm not even sure where to start. am i liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard? since our property is a notable size we have no tresspassing signs around but they're of course not visible from the air.

edit: this post got more traction than i was expecting. i'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where i am. i grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. from elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

they've had dramatic changes over the years. in high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). a decade later, i can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. it's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. many middle/high school kids have lan parties. smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). my library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

even though i prefer pin-drop silence, i have no issues with these changes. **it's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. and putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",9

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

"college isn't the only way to start a good career. apprenticeships, trade schools, and military training can be great alternatives in today's world.. the price of four-year universities in the us, among other countries, is huge and growing. there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

if, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**to high school juniors and seniors:** 

your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. if you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. here(https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

these jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. as that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. according to this article(http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. anecdotally, i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**is there any money in it?**

there definitely can be. unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. i'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until _ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt later. 

that's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. you're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**what are my options?**

there are a ton of ways to start a career, but i'll talk about a few.

**apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

a recent report(https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germany's industrial success. the us government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. the federal program is here(https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job center(https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. in a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. one example would be the ibew(http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so i won't bother trying to list a bunch. searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**trade schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. it isn't for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**military** training can also be a great economic ladder. the pay and benefits are good from the start. depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. there are some huge risks associated with this route though, so i would reserve it as a last resort. 

regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. that is not the only income, though. in most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. that's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. on the outside, that would cost a lot.

regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. you could also be a bus driver. you don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. i would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military. there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. the good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. the bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

i know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. in reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**tl;dr**

if you want to get smart, go to college. if you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**edit:** based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. as a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the af lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""no thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

also about the military, i offered it up as a last resort, and i mean that. plenty of commentators are saying ""don't ever think about joining the military for training!"" i don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. if you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

regarding rotc, it is better than nothing. i intentionally didn't mention it though. my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting. if you do rotc, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. after 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. if you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the af, can't say how easy it is in the others. so you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. from a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. additionally, i had a way better time than any officer i know, and i didn't even like the military. the lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. i wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

still relevant to rotc, but about school in general... a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. i'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful lpt. you have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",9

"if ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for ""free"", search for ""open source"" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware. the reasoning being if you type ""free"", generally you will be advertised to or get the lite version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.

open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

edit: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't mean that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

i am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

edit 2:

as this thread has gained a lot of traction let's address some points: yes, we know you can torrent a paid-for application. hilarious as it is for you to keep posting it, you don't need to tell us. open source is still valid for those of us who believe in privacy, transparency and actually supporting a developer. we are aware of pirating websites, i promise.

an example of what i'm talking about here is that i used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  at first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  the answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether i do it or not. now i don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

i also noticed that i was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. people would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated i was doing it. i stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. now i only do it if i feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

"if you get a kitten, do use your hands for play so you can teach restraint when they are too rough. restraint is naturally learned in play with hands and littermates because the fun stops when a bite or scratch is too much. adult cats who didn't play this way are more likely to scratch or bite.. obviously this only works if you shout loudly (""oww!"") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.

i've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. for example, i have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and i can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. but once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

similarly, there was i time i had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. this goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",9

so the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they're boring is: you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you're talking to. listen. ask questions/follow-up questions. laugh at their jokes. and they'll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to.

edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. for some extra help / elucidation:

-	i found this very helpful when i was starting my career. the biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out ""on paper"" to better see where things need to change, where i didn't know all i could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	i am indeed now a director. our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. it's those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; i can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. as a manager, it's a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. i'm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it's because they've found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	most importantly, where i'm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they've been forced to ""work themselves out of a job"" then they can sue for constructive dismissal. i know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it's not a common motif. as such, i do agree that if you're in a country like india, china, usa, where some of these protections and freedoms aren't so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. in others, like germany, uk, most of scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

but yes, as with anything - this has been an experience i've personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. i guess as a second tip - if you're working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it's time to find a new company to work for...",9

edit: since this has blown up beyond anything i could have expected, i feel the need to address a couple of things. there are about 1000 of you screaming ""just make it from scratch!"" and y'all are missing the point. whether you love it or hate it, box cake mix is a thing, and they're extremely popular. millions of people use them all the time. they use them because they're easy, inexpensive, and accessible. there are 8 billion people on this planet and not everyone knows how to bake. not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. and that's ok. but for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. all i did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look. 

second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. and you know what? that's fantastic! if you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! you bake that cake! baking should be enjoyable, and if it's delicious then why does it matter how you get there? everyone has to start somewhere so play around with it, experiment, learn what you like, and what works for you. have fun with it. it's just cake.",9

channel 11 only one had one other, so i changed my wifi signal to use channel 11. immediately after i ran speedtest and got 87mbps.

"got a friend or family in the hospital? consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/ereader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.. note: *this is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

i was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. this made me realize what i would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- hospital hvacs systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. i was told they could only bump it up or down here at my va hospital. also, this was the first time i received an iv treatment and let me tell you they are cold... had an iv in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and i am pretty convinced i could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**warm, comfortable socks**- reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *credit*: /u/getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so i followed up and asked my nurse about this.  turns out, the va hospital does have socks available and my new rn was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**condiments** - i believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. this problem might be compounded by medication. may have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **edit** i recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  generally, it would be wiser to consult with the rn or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**open toe slippers**- luckily i had flip flops on when i was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if i only had tennis shoes. probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**long, braided phone charger** - my wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. i can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. i recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. also, i am using a 5ft usb hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**entertainment**: a book, ereader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   the tv service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. if they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. the gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *edit* /u/stjerndale recommended audiobooks.  great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**gift cards**: *credit: /u/1900grs, /u/halftimeheaters.*  gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*bonus lpt*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  they take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  this bonus lpt is intended for *adult patients.*


edit 1

**power bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  this was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


edit 2

**eye mask & ear plugs** - /u/ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/suedeveil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**moisturizers & chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/fatjennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  i will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.",9

"for those in flooded areas, use extreme caution when walking on streets and sidewalks. manhole covers are often forced off by the flood and can be extremely dangerous as people can fall in, get trapped, and drown.. i'm from new orleans where flooding is common. rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood). it creates underground rivers and people fall in and drown. 

use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.

people often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. however the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

it is way easier to see with an image(http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). if you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

so i started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. it totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person i was talking to more receptive to my instructions. instead of turning into an argument or debate, it turns into a constructive teaching opportunity.

"lpts: chrome extensions i wish i knew of back when i started college.. as i am about to enter my grad school i have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. as a result, i recently started exploring chrome extensions, and man i wish i had done this earlier. some will no longer be of use to me but i hope it can help others. 

**cite this for me: web citer**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
this one hurts me a bit as my days with mla, apa, harvard, and chicago are coming to an end. the extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. from my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as easybib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

**google dictionary**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
if you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). it's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

**grammarly for chrome**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
i often use bad grammar and i know it. this extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

**readability**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. i would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article i'd give this a shot. 

**speakit!**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-us)

i know i can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. this app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. or i guess you could take notes as you listen too...

it works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand german-english accents over the default one). you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

**block & focus**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. there are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

**molview**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

i haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in o-chem or higher. it allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. i was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what i'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**bonus tips that i learned**


***make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***use sleepyti.me(http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** it's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. i cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying. 

***use rainymood(https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** i'm sure many of you know about it but i love this one.

i'm sure i have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. feel free to tell me any i should try out!

"if you believe your employer may be discriminating against you when it comes to pay, do not be afraid to ask your coworkers what they make. it is a federally protected right to speak about salary.. in the usa, since 1935, there has been a federal law that prohibits any company in the private sector (and as of 2014, also the federal sector and federal contractors) from discriminating or terminating an employee for sharing their salary with others.

keep in mind, there are certain positions that are specifically excluded from this law:
- workers in religious schools (they must follow the school's rules)   
- agricultural laborers   
- airline employees   
- supervisors (who aren't classed as ""employees"" for this purpose)  
- independent contractors 

while it may not be specifically stated in the law, positions in human resources or financial positions may also be prohibited from speaking about pay in certain instances, since they often handle money. 

keep in mind, that while an employer can not stop you from talking about your salary in general, they are within their right to ask you not to do it on company time. 

also, keep in mind that while you are within your right to talk about salaries, you should be careful who you tell.

got one last year, was surprised at how cheap and effective it is.

our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut. we used this and found very slight cracks in the chaulking that were letting cold air in. after using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.

bonus: you can aim it at pans/foods and tell temps within a few degrees (surface only of course).

double bonus: aim it at your so and say you found something hot.

you can get them on amazon shipped right to you and the batteries last forever, enjoy!

to answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven.

"bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike. **tl;dr: short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

the recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

she survived, but she easily could have died. *on a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

i myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. the only time i've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. i got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. it really can happen to just about anyone. i got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

and now, with the popularity of parks exploding, i see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. if anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

so: never go unprepared. get a wide-mouth nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

the things i have in mine include:

\- survival heating blanket

\- plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- whistle

\- flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- critical meds and bandages

\- zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- compass (if you're able to use it)

\- paracord

\- knife

\- duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (i always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing i can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - i've experienced this first-hand).

\- iodine tabs for water

\- beef jerky

\- energy gel

**edit:** because it may be of interest: i just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that i don't mention in the list. for reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**edit 2:** i wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. the kit i describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

the kit i mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

for people wanting to see the kit i made, or skeptical it can be done - just google nalgene survival kit. lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than i have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *this kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",9

"don't judge your ""market value"" as a romantic partner during your teenage years/ early twenties. a lot of decisions during that time are hormone-driven.. adolescence lasts much longer than most people think, until around 25. before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. thus, our ""true personality"" only manifests itself during the late twenties.

before that happens, people are often ""in lust"" rather than in love, but without realizing it. our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young. this can lead to our relationship decisions in high school and sometimes college being based on biological urges rather than compatibility of personalities.

"bunnys are no easter gift.. with easter coming around again there are many bunnies gifted away to children in too small cages and most of the time alone, and not neutered and/or spayed. 

some facts for y'all.

bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

they poop. a lot.

you need to clean their toilets. a lot.

you need at least 2 bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be spayed*)


bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

bunnies are not for picking up! they are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

they need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

you need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

this post was created because my sister wanted to gift 1 bunny to my nephew and i had to talk her out of it, so please don't gift bunnies they are a fuckton of work.

"lpt request : do not request one hour dry cleaning if you can help it.. as a dry cleaner, i can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. if a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. 
it take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. that is if all the stains came out on the first try. most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. and that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.
usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. they have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups.
in summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things.
before, it was possible cause perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from perc by now, especially in california.

my neighbourhood has a lot of crows. over twenty of them. they are generally on good terms with one another.

i watched them band together and kill one of the crows. they left its dead body in my yard. i waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because i don't want crow guts everywhere.

however, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. this brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. none of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time i am outside. some swoop. they are becoming more and more aggressive.

"am i a loser for being a virgin at 27 years old?. i was born in vietnam and moved to the us when i was 23. i had some girls interested in me during college (in vietnam) but we never made a move because you know, it's vietnam and it's the cultural thing back then. then i moved to the us. haven't found anyone since. there's so few asian in my city let alone vietnamese. my college is full of white and latins (demographics). don't get me wrong i don't mind dating out of my race but college folks here seem to keep to themselves, even men. i made some friends but as soon as semester ends they all go their own path. some even deleted my number and ignored me. and it seems like all women are taken. in the end maybe it's because i'm not good looking (short, dark skin, average looking face). i also have moderate depression & anxiety. 


then people made fun of me when they knew i'm a virgin. even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

i made a post in a tech subreddit. not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

i know it might not be a big deal. but i felt so down after that. i felt like i should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... 

do i have hobbies? yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. i keep a big fish tank and i love them. i play video games too. i've been rescuing stray dogs since i moved here. i used to volunteer at my local shelter but since i adopted my dog here and got busy with school i volunteer much less nowadays...

also, i know rule 5 says no medical advice, but this seems less than ""how do i treat \_\_\_\_ disease"" and more of ""everyone does this and i don't what should i do?"" i'm going to get vaccinated but it's more of a matter of where do i go to get vaccines.

"just became homeless and have $130 and a bike, what do i do?. so a few hours ago i was kicked out of my parents house. i've been ""disowned"" or something. they made it really clear they wont be taking me back. im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.

i was able to get my bike from my parents' since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. i was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. im guessing i'll have to buy something every few hours so i won't get kicked out. 

so basically what the fuck do i do next? im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. so if there's an app or a website for that i'll take recommendations.




edit: im saved!! well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. he works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won't be until 5 or 6 am. right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. this post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

edit2: wow this blew up fast. i see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. i never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. i wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. i'm extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. as long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

a lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. i worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

a lot of people were recommending joining the military. i've considered the navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)

anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. i moved my arm away to which she responded ""don't you like to be touched?"" to which i responded ""not by you"". so she went to kick me in the balls but i moved out of the way and said ""no chance"". 

as we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. she moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which i pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. she said ""i'm only joking"" before trying to do it again in fucking plain sight of the others. i told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. all the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. the manager wasn't present during this.

anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said ""dude, isn't that basically sexual assault?"" i responded ""is it?"" he said ""man, she literally molested you and tried again"" 

honestly, i don't know what to think. i am contemplating telling the manager but i feel she'll laugh it off and class it as a joke because i'm a man. and no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn't taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. just think of it, if i had done that, i'd be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.

edit/update #1: this had almost 9k upvotes.  i said from maybe 2k upvotes that if this hit 10k, i would try it.  i have a vice ready to go (even though the surface area is tiny).  i am on a diet (and have a biggest loser competition at work), but i will definitely do this tomorrow, diet be damned.  i am still as curious as i was when it started.  i'll have my wife as a spotter to make sure i don't die.  i will probably use wonderbread since that is the consensus ""bread"", even though i feel like i should try multiple breads.  i'll probably post the link here, but i also need to know where i can post the youtube link as a follow up so everyone can watch this go down.  

i am equally psyched and afraid of what might happen, that is going to destroy my insides.  let's do this!

ps. i will have this filmed and post it on youtube with links.  not gonna be happy, but i will post video evidence whenever i can, maybe even the poopy (gross).

update #2: i'll be buying bread later today and doing this. i'll post a link here to youtube with the process. two questions: what sub should i post it in, in addition to linking it here? and is there any free video editing software, for trimming any boring parts, or blurring anything out (in case i have like a letter with my name and address out and i realize after the fact)?

thanks everyone! 

update #3: i just completed the video recording of this and will be uploading it to youtube shortly. i'll post the link here but i'll have to post a link to it in a new post somewhere too, i can't let this go to waste.

update #4:  okay, the video exists!  i didn't watch the entire thing, but i made sure it was full.  please be gentle, this isn't r/roastme!  i posted it at the videos subreddit.  the link is https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/apbdaq/squishing_an_entire_loaf_of_bread_and_trying_to/ and i will follow up one last time on here later with how i feel afterwards.  i don't want to spoil anything for anyone yet.  it is a 22 minute video, so feel free to skip most of it so you don't have to hear my stupid face talking the whole time.",7

"why are there so many popular right-wing ""dominant debaters"" (ben shapiro, milo yiunnapalosi), but left-wing counterparts seem nowhere to be found?. tl;dr: the personality of an ""always right"", dominant debater, is common amongst several right-wing public figures, but i have trouble understanding why the same personality seems so scarce within left politics.

the whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that steven crowder guy from the meme). you see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

i'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

but i never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. hell i can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

again not in any way arguing for or against right wing/left wing. i don't think right wing argues with facts and left with feelings, thats just the result of the image ben shapiro seems to commercialize",7

"a pigeon just laid an egg on my fucking bed and is always coming inside my room.. so really quick background on this, i live in my apartment in an 11th-floor room and hence we have rooms with a small balcony on the corner. so there are this two pigeons (a couple i assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. i thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. so some days later, i found a twig in my bed. and then is when i realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. so i then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.

so things were kinda okay but then after coming home, i found that i forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. and also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause i was too lazy to sort them out. i scared the pigeon away, but then i found an egg in my bed. it fucking laid an egg. why are these birds so dumbasses? man, also i live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. i didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as i thought.  so i put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  but the bird is not coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. i placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? so what am i gonna do? will the egg not hatch if this goes on?

so is there any problem that if i touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?

***edit*** \#4: idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. so when i found the bird and the egg on my bed, i think it was gonna lay another egg but i scattered it away. and quick facts on pigeons on the way;

* sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs
* most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah i thought they laid two at the same time)
* and as u/kelekona said, they mostly nest in cliffs most often, so i'm guessing the apartment looked like a cliff to it? man these birbs",7

"so how exactly did the playboy mansion work? did hugh hefner just hire attractive women to come in and live there? i don't understand. also why do some people hate hugh hefner so badly?. i'm young (21 years) and maybe i missed when playboy was a big thing. i know what it is but i don't know much about backstory. but even after looking it up i don't get some things. 

so basically how did the playboy mansion work? so a bunch of hot girls were selected to live with hugh hefner for a selected amount of time and get paid for it? 

i saw a post in the ""askwomen"" sub and they were all about how hugh hefner is a gross misogynistic guy who exploited women with the playboy magazine. this confuses me because it was my understanding that he did not force women to do the things women did for playboy. iirc these women in the playboy magazine and playboy mansion were consensually choosing to pose nude (which is not a bad thing: your body, your choice, do you) and be in the mansion. so why do some people hate hugh so badly? like what exactly did he do? and also how did the playboy mansion work?

"why does everyone say not to pee in the shower?. i fully understand not peeing while taking a bath, but what is the big deal about peeing in the shower? i have never in my life heard a single legit reason other than the obvious ""pee is gross so don't do it"".

you are under a constant stream of water and there's already dirt, soap, whatever else you may need to scrub off going down the drain and human urine is less harmful to the environment than some of the things that get washed down the drain. and we all know that water doesn't get recycled through your tank. 

the only other reason i've ever been given is ""girls shouldn't because it just runs down their leg and that's gross, especially since they probably just shaved their leg so all those pores are opened up"" which, personally, my first response was `??????????????????` and my second was `no`.

i will fight to the end for my right to pee in the shower and this world isn't strong enough to stop me, i will show no mercy as my fluids release under warm euphoric streams of life-giving aqua.

but for real i am genuinely curious from an educational standpoint.

edit: i know it isn't totally clear but i'm specifically referring to private showers, not something like a locker room shower or other communal showers. some folks in the comments have been nice enough to point this out as a more common reason for that to be spread as a standard.

"someone in my apartment building is smoking weed and it's coming into my unit through the ventilation somewhere, making everything i own smell like weed.. my wife is in the military, so this is a huge fucking deal. there's a ventilation shaft in the utility closet with the water heater, right next to the door, which is also right next to the washer and dryer. anyone outside of my door can smell the weed coming from the ventilation, and any time you walk into my apartment it's the first thing you smell. being a military family and having our laundry smell like weed can get us both in really, really big trouble. is there any way i can prevent this?

edit: wow this blew up. i was not expecting that. try to get back to the comments in the morning lol  
  
edit 2: thanks for all the responses, guys. wasn't expecting this to be popular at all. reading through most of the comments (and sorry i don't have time to reply to everyone!), i think my best temporary option is to try filtering the smell from the vent i think it's coming from as best as i can. if that doesn't work, i may try the ""positive air flow"" technique recommended by the thermodynamics stoner. a more long-term solution would be to contact housing if it continues to be a problem, as my only two concerns is that my apartment doesn't have a smell when i move out, and my wife's clothes don't smell like weed when she's at work.  
  
reading through my lease agreement, i actually don't see anywhere that mentions drug use, or even smoking of any kind. thinking back, the area around the demo room when we were being shown around before we signed a lease reeked of weed as well.  
  
lastly, i'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. i don't care if anyone else smokes weed. i was born and raised in austin. i can probably count on one hand how many people i knew that didn't smoke weed in my 30 years living there. i just don't think my apartment needs to smell like that, you know?

"update my 32m best friend 30 f asked if i would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, i am in love with her but sje has no idea.. i appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. there was a few idiots telling me i needed to be alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

anyway the consensus with my rl friends was i needed to tell her. we do brunch on saturdays because she does yoga sundays so we met up this morning. 

i could barely eat and she could tell something was up. she got worried thinking i was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

i sat her down and told her everything how i realized i was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. i told her that i never said anything because i did not want to jeopardize our friendship. her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

i honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and i honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. she half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

we hugged and i told her that there is no one on this earth i would want to have a child with but her. we talked for hours ,in fact i just got home. we have decided that we want to focus on us for now. i want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

i know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

however i am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

"i (m28) broke up with my ex-fiancee (f27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. i am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.. hey guys,

i need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

a little background: 

me and my ex-fiancee had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. i was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. she was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

back in april of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. i once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

it all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in june because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. that was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. i didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. i fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. it made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

everything was kinda ok until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. the picture was of my ex-fiancee at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. i fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. she was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

when i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

she cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. i was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

i told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. she begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

i did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancee had comitted suicide. her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

i am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancee friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

i am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",8
"mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.. update 3:

hey guys, and update has already been posted here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). please don't message me so angrily any more.

update 2:

sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. regardless, i think i will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

my sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and i have her support.

i promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now i need to support my grandma.

thank you again to everyone.

update:

sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but i chickened out half way through what i had to say :(

the good news is that i am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

thank you for all your support, everyone, i will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

my grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

i will let you know how i manage.

thank you again.

\-

pretty much the title. i have no idea how to process all this, and i am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

both my older brother and sister went to the same college. my brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. both had their college paid by our dad. dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

my brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

my sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

i got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. i always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

instead i was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how i am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. he said it was never is place to say anything since i am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

apparently my grandparents know i am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

my siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as i am because there was never a hint of anything being off. i might be naive, but i always thought i had a great relationship with my dad. we go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when i had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. i never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. i mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. it's a story he tells from time to time. he likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

my mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

i feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. i am not even sure i will be able to go to college any more, i always assumed my parents will pay for it. i never had a job, and i am not sure what job i can even get to support me through college, i have no idea how to apply for loans.

all my mom has done is cry and apologize. but nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

i don't even know if i am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, i feel shame leaving my room, and if i will be asked to move out i don't know where to go. i don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

i am angry at my mom, i am confused about where i stand with my dad. there's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. i feel rejected and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

anyone have any idea what to do here?

do i apologize to my dad? what do i say to him?

idk, i've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. i have no idea what to do.

\-

edit: comments are coming in faster than i can reply, but i am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things i didn't even think about before. thank you everyone.

i will try to answer as much as i can, but there's more comments than i can handle.",8
"happy update: it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

hi all. first off, i want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or pm. i am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support i received and i spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as i read your messages and well wishes.

the night after i wrote my original post, i wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/witchy_woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

""dear \wife's name\,

i love you more than you can imagine and the most i want in this world is for you to be happy. i understand that as a man i probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. i'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. i honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. however, i want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. i'm ready to talk whenever you are.

with all my love,

\my name\""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. the next morning (march 16th), i woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed oj. when i walked into the bedroom with her food, i saw her reading my letter. when she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. full on, niagara falls level crying. i hugged her tighter, told her ""i love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. i honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. it could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, i didn't care. when she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud i was when i heard those words. she then asked me if we could go on a trip to japan because in her words ""i really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

i was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. she's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels i saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. we just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. we have a 5am uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

we're not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

edit: i'm going to bed. thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.",8
"update i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i talked to her.. i would like to preface this post with an apology. i know it has been nearly three weeks since i last posted. to be honest, in no world did i ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. i've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original it, i have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. for that, i am sorry.

for the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. it is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

for the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a greek tragedy, i apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

now to start where things left off.

after making my original post, i combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a plan b box and thrown it into the garbage. a lot of them made sense. my greatest hope was that it might have just been old. maybe it was before we even met. clinging to that, i hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. i'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what i would say in response, and what i would do. i memorized them all.

on the evening after i made my original post, i called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. as i had practiced, i asked her the following question:

>hey, i'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up plan b box in the garbage? 

the second the words ""plan b"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. she was completely lost for words. i already knew at that point. i retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>why was there a torn up plan b box in the garbage? you know i had a vasectomy. 

she just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. then she looked to the floor. then she started weakly sobbing. 

this was not on the flowchart. i had no idea how to respond. i thought if i let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. finally i prompted her with another question:

>are you crying because you did something you regret?

she shook her head violently. i was so concerned because i thought something horrendous might have happened.

she abruptly shrieked ""i'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" i have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

so i prompted her again. 

>just tell me why it was there. you don't have to hide anything from me.

she yelled at me again. repeatedly. ""if you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""fuck you for not trusting me.""

this line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. i refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, i wasn't budging an inch. she then informed me that either i had to leave or she would leave. since i doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), i agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. i went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

the following night, i texted her asking if she was ready to talk. she was not. instead, she gave me an ultimatum: i had to 1 apologize, 2 promise to never bring it up again, and 3 learn to trust her completely. only then would she allow me back home. if i couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

i have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. i am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. i currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. the lawyer will probably tell me i'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

there is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. i am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. none of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. i'm holding off on saying anything until i'm calm and rational and won't do something i'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, i feel awful about it. ",8
"update my grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (f24) to marry him (26). i don't know what to do, since i don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).. hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my previous post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that i come clean to sam. i did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. i asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

his cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. he told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. they wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

he then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. he told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

well i think it's working. sam and i have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night i notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. sam and my grandpa are both ww2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with sam. 

i decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. i got there before sam, and i could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought i had come alone_. they asked where sam was, when he was coming etc. then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived. 

i'm just so incredibly happy that i get to keep both relationships.",8
"update : wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"". it has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

^((original post)(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

i called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . he seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  he said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. i sat her down and we talked. all she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . i tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. i asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. she said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . so i did. she kept changing subjects or saying that "" a mother just feels it. you wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". she got very agitated and was crying telling me that if i wanted to leave her i should simply leave but i shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200b;

somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

after she did i went on her computer. i do **never** snoop on her. but i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . oh boy. she was in 2 facebook groups. one was a normal mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. in the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. they were feeding in each others delusions. a woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. my wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. so many women were making her fear that i would leave. saying things like men can not stick to a woman . many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

i was really fucking scared. i researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of schizophrenia(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3361851/). so to say the least i could not sleep. i was and am still very afraid of losing her. she woke up and i tried to act like nothing was wrong . we were going to the doctor. and it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. she was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. he was really tactful when talking to my wife. he tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. we tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. she got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . she began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . we could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . she could not breathe. the doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . she had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. did an ekg to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

at that point i really had no other option than to inquire about involuntary commit. so i could not do it myself . i needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . after that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". so far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . my wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. when i last her she was furious with me. she said i was taking away her freedom which i am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. she is so mad at me. i feel like i am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. i love her with all my heart. i am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . i feel like i failed to protect her. at this point i am just rambeling . sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . i feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : i will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! when i gave my vows i meant trough illness and bad times. i am not only on the ride for the good times. if you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? i am here to stay. i will not divorce her. she is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. i hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

sorry for the rant. but if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. i understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it beginns to mess with their mental health  and i respect that but i won't do that.

edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. she was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

i don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as i was so distraught. but i was not a sedative. i think it was something along the lines of valium or baldrian. over the counter stuff mostly.

she has family. she is estranged from most of them. her sister is now at our place to help.

also refrain from such stupid comments like ""i'll bet she will leave bro. she is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. just seems like you want me to divorce. get a life.",8
"my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married.. my fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. we decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. everything was going great. he seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

i am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and i wasn't fussed so i agreed to saving it. he has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. i laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. no turns out he was dead serious. he wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know i am still 'pure'.

i told him fat chance i am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. he said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much i love him and that i have nothing to hide anyway as i am still a virgin. i left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

i want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. but at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and i dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

what the frick frack do i do. i am currently at my friends house and i might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and i am straight up panicking.",8
"i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. throwaway, because reasons.

tl;dr: found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. asked girlfriend about it. she started yelling at me and crying and left.

i don't even know where to start with this. i'm dumbfounded. she just stormed out the house and i'm sitting on the bed asking myself a lot of questions.

i live a pretty normal life, and i thought so did my girlfriend. we've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. we started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. she would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. i'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. i always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, i wouldn't stop her.

this is where it takes a turn for the weird. i keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. i also go to the gym frequently, so i always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. i never kept count, but i know by just a visual glance i several pairs. this morning when i went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, i noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. i went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so i checked the washing machine and dryer. both were empty. i couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. so, i did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. after all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. she went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. when i went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. i told her i wasn't mad, i was just looking for my socks. she kinda mumbled ""i'll don't know."" i still wasn't mad, of course, but i was super confused. socks just don't disappear. so i asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""i'll buy you new ones!""

the first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. i thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so i joked with her about ruining my socks. wrong. thing. to. say. she started immediately crying. like, full on sobbing. at this point i don't care about the socks anymore, i want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. i sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. she just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. i tried assuring her again it was okay. even went so far as to say i would buy new socks and she didn't have to. i sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. i told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

on my way out i grabbed the garbage to take outside. when i got outside i lifted the lid off the garbage can and i noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. i could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. since i was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, i wanted to see for myself. i opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. there, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. as soon as the smell hit me i knew it was poop.

1. we don't own any pets.
2. we don't have any kids.
3. whose poop was on my socks?

work could wait. i couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. i grabbed the bag and walked back inside. as soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. she said i shouldn't be going through the garbage and that i was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. i asked her to calm down and that i just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. i wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. that's when it clicked. i don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. i asked her ""is this your poop?"" she started sobbing again and ran out of the house. i didn't go after her this time.

so, now i am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. the only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. i sent her text asking her to come back. she hasn't responded yet. i don't even know what i'm going to say when (if) she gets back.

update:

i had to leave for work and am now at work. yes, i threw away the bag of poopy socks. she texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. she said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to not bring it up in person. i'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as i can. her responses are super short, but i'm getting the idea.

i flat out asked her if it was a fetish. it is not a fetish. she confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. i found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. i had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? she thought i would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. she admitted she has done this for a long time. her reasoning, as best as i can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. she uses socks because it covers her entire hand. after she's done with them, she throws them away. she used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

so, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. it could be worse, i guess. i hope we can laugh about this later. i'm trying to find the humor in it now, but i'm still weirded out.

"me 52m just found out at least 4 of my 5 children 33f30f28m24f14f are not mine. wife 51f wont say anything.. ***note: please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. if you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local medlab (medical lab). ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. in my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

i apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. i posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested i ask on r/parenting. but i also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so i want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

first of all, i'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, i am not really in the best state of mind. my world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. i just want to write as much context as possible so i can get the best advice needed. for obvious reasons, i am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

background: i met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. we have 5 beautiful children together - really, i consider them a total blessing regardless of what i'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago i thought that we had the perfect marriage. we were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, i feel like i've done everything a loving husband should do. i am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant i work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but i want to stress that i've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. and never in a million years would i ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. and the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested i was not her father. she confided this to me privately, showing me the results and i could tell she was visibly upset by this. of course, the first thing i did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and i'll always love her unconditionally. but secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. it comes back and i am indeed not her biological father.

this news really broke me. i'm ashamed to say i broke down in tears in front of my daughter. the combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset i was making my daughter by how i was reacting. i really wish i had kept it in for her sake, but i didn't.

following this i asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. i wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, i could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. however i didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really i didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

we tell the other three what has happened, i reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that i'll always be there dad, but that i need to know how long this has been going on. god, i can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. they didn't care i wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken i was. i feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

so we have paternity tests for each of the three done. not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. which somehow made it worse. it's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? i can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

so i confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. she doesn't confess. she doesn't even take it seriously. she says the tests must be flawed. all four? how the hell am i supposed to take that seriously?

i keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. when i bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""we've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. but how am i supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

now that i have rambled and explained what has happened. i guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. how can i reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? i feel like the way i have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times i reassure them.

2. how do i handle my youngest daughter? i feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and i will need to tell my daughter something. i don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but i also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. is there anyway, anyway at all, you think i could or should save my marriage? i've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. i know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. if there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, i want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. wife refuses to confess her infidelity. unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

edit: thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. i have not replied to as many comments as i should have, but i've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. i'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. again, i can't begin to thank you for all your support. if this is resolved i might post an update, but if she continues to lie then i don't think i'll bother, as there's not much more i can add. from the advice in this and the r/parenting thread i've decided to:

1. get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. tell my youngest of the situation. ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. it will be entirely her decision.

4. i'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. my mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and i owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), i have not ruled out some form of counselling. but at the moment i think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

once again i'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

edit2: i guess i should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **how did the ancestry results suggests i wasn't her father?** my family is entirely irish. no relatives outside of ireland other than my immediate family, and i even have the stereotypical red hair. my daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the british isles/western europe/northern europe. that's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **which two children share the same father?** my two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **how did your wife conceive your children?** our eldest daughter was not planned. all the others were planned. each time we conceived several months after we started trying. our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. she was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually i agreed. she was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **are you infertile?** i don't know. i've never had a fertility test done. but the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that i might be. i will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

"31m husband cheated on 27f me with his fit and skinny gym friend. i came home from work early (i'm an ob nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. at that point, i sort of already knew what i'd be walking into. my husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. she's beautiful and thin and everything i am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. so, i talked to him about it. he encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

i walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. they were having sex. in our bed. with a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. i silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and i've returned to the hospital. he called me asking why i wasn't home and i told him my shift is extended but in reality, i'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as i type this.

i feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. i don't even know how to proceed. on one hand i want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, i'm an ugly woman....its not like i can do better. i just want to die. i feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. advice please.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all for the kind comments and support. please stop commenting, however. i think i've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). i don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. i still have no idea what i am going to do and i know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. he was a great husband and i can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. i don't know if i will stay, but that's all i really know right now.

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while i'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how i should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. it is incredibly upsetting and i am already going through a lot. i feel i need to clarify since everyone seems to care that i had food after i found out. i had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which i had been all over the place. i had lunch at 11am and nothing else until i left. i was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. please stop harassing me about that.",8
"update: my sister (f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (f46) is pressuring me to. thanks for the great advice. so a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

my grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

i explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who stan lee was. surprisingly she understood just perfectly. i was relieved. for a moment i thought that my dad and i would get shit from everyone.
my sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". i told her that she asked me and i just told the truth.

but what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. she again ridiculed my hobby and so on. one of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. the dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. she is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

my mom and sister came back in the morning. they didn't talk much to us . my mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. we had a short dry conversation till she asked me why i was making such a big deal about it. and i shut her up like you guys told me to. i started by explain who stan lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. it's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. you said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because i didn't lend her my jacket ""

ya'll my mom cried. she apologized profusely. she said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as i was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

my mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",8
"update mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.. the reaction to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

i am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and i am still processing it.

i did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and i know where i now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

i am not sure i would have had the courage to say what i had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

i think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. it makes me uncomfortable knowing i am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. a lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

i have so far went through 40% (i estimate) of the comments, but i have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

the conclusion is that i am definitely going to college, it will be the college i have always wanted to go to, and i will have the same experience as my siblings. the money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

what started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then i showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

my parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when i came back pregnant"", or something like that, i was not there, this is what she told me. i guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision i ever made"" or something like that. and their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

yeah, it went downhill from there fast. shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here i am.

dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

i did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. my brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

my grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, i guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

reading the comments was a mind opening experience. i felt unprepared for the world out there. many have asked how i had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. of course i knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

i went from ""i am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and i will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. for me it was a sudden change in reality.

going through the comments i managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. really good stuff that i think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

my parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and i haven't even read all comments. i can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. i understand his reaction, but i still feel hurt by it. i understand he was not in the best place of mind, but i can't control my feelings either. we will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

mom hasn't handled everything that well. but she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

when mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. he kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. so my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (i am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

the man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. he was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, i guess he had more important things to do. but it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

and i don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. i thought about the matter the last two weeks, since i've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if i have other siblings out there.

i was suggested to go and buy a dna kit from 23andme, maybe i can find him that way, but i think i will avoid doing this specifically so i don't find him or he finds me. as far as i care, i have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

moving forward i do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like i would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

my mom admits i've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

i did learn where i stand with my family, and it's safe to say that i am loved, and i have options. i thought i am isolated, but my world is wider than i thought. grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

i think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, i think i will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

thank you.

edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",8
"update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**tl;dr:** wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july. wife got pregnant anyways. it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.

update **tl;dr** at bottom

first i just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  i can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

i took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  i had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  it wasn't until i got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that i was able to try and move on.  my wife and i actually met in a soccer league we were in together. we've had so much trust for so long that i thought those fears had gone away.  it wasn't until now that i really started to feel shaken like that again.

but i didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  a few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

it's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. i didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  i got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. i couldn't wait any longer.  i made our favorite omelets, and told her i needed to talk about something.

""you know i'm not ashley, right?""

she knows me well.  ashley's my ex who cheated.

so first i apologized.  i apologized because i let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  what should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

we talked for a while.  i told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. i told her how much i loved the relationship that we've built together, and i felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  she had never given me a reason not to trust her and that i still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  she thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  she volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

but something still felt off.  i honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  normally she would have been upset that i didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling i couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

it seemed like she was saying all the right things, but i couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  maybe i'm just being paranoid.  maybe there's a gut feeling that i need to listen to.  but i ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if i still needed the surgery.

turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  i've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. so i brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. the urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that i wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. he mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

being there didn't really help.  i feel like i just got more uncertainty.  

she had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  we talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. she seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. she promised to do it in the morning.  i asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

there's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  i really couldn't put my finger on it.  we were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and i couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had sunday.

i've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but i haven't been able to focus.  we have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  this morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. we don't do that, she's never needed to before.  and i checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time thursday that i mentioned i was busy working on-site. we were supposed to go together.

i'm starting to go crazy. how do i bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  i'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  but i need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if i'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**tl;dr had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  urologist said i had obstructive azoospermia, implied i should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think i could be fertile.  wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when i can't go.  getting a second urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

update:  i've been trying to center myself.  we talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  she claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  i didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  i'm just trying to not overreact right now. i don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and im a father! or...not.  thankfully she's not working late today.  

thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

update:  i went for a long run to clear my mind.  gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  i'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why i've still been struggling personally with some of them.  regardless of what happens i'm done with any confusion left between us.

  thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.. wife and i have been together since high school. married for 10 years. i'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

my wife's best friend megan and i work for the same company( different departments ). so yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. so i met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. i tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

according to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. she confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

and when i confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when i told her that megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

i really don't know what to do. i mean, everything was a lie right? my little girl taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. what do i live for now? i just don't know what to do. just here for some advice. i'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",8
"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything?. original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

edit: jesus christ this exploded fast. thanks for all the kind words people 😅",8
"happy update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

i'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  i definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what i posted.  but hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes i guess.

anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  i told her everything that was going on.  the urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  i told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

she agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  she didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  she knew i was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. we talked about it sunday, but i can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  and so while she had thought we were communicating, i wasn't.  we decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

the money was the real problem for me. she agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  she offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if i really wanted we could move the money back.  she does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

we read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  it seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (cbavd) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. we're going to go back to the original specialist i was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  it turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  i told her i took off work to go with, and she was relieved i could join.

once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  after going through each thing i was just wishing i believed her a little more before. she's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. she even offered an open phone policy if i needed.  we did look at the text i had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  i declined though right now, since i don't want to be that husband.

this has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  that level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  i think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. i was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  this has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but i'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

she thought that an nipp asap was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  i'm not big on therapy, but i can probably agree that it will most likely help.

i'm feeling a little better about everything.  thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (every other comment here i read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   it's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**tl;dr  use your words. - wife and i objectively went through everything.  we both apologized, getting a nipp soon and hopefully a therapist.**

update: the paternity test came back intially positive for anyone that's going to see this : )",8
"final update: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her when she wouldn't abort the baby.. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

tldr: my gf was raped. wanted to abort. talked to mother. decided not to abort. i left her. 

update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/
  
tldr: gf calls me, reveals mum made her not get an abortion because god cares. she wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. some of reddit think i'm a baby killer.

update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

tldr: mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


i just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. this will be my final update.

a few days ago, the abortion was carried out. during the weeks beforehand, my gf went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. she was also tested for any stis (she's clear!).

she went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. a few days ago it was successfully carried out.

they went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. gf said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

when she came home, she cried and cried and cried. she says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

we took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). while in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

she's amazing, man. seriously.


update on the mum! so my gf received a call from her mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

my gf and i have an agreement that if mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. in this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

i told the mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. i then said ""how jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

my gf didn't find it funny...

anyway, that's it.


good luck to everyone in their lives.

also, if you're going to message and insult me via pm, just be warned: i've killed ^a ^baby before.",8
"update i (28m) is about to propose to my gf (28f) of 7 years, but then i discovered something. need advice.. hello guys. im providing an update to my earlier post

i dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. so here's what happened. 

-she texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 pm (she's closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-i tried to facetime her 11:51 pm just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. i tried messaging her but no response. 

remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? i browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 pm.

i played and listened. there's her voice and a voice of another guy. they were goofing around at the google home device. so yeah. 

i confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 am.  she kept on denying she's cheating.

then i laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

she finally admitted. 

i am single.

"can't wait until thursday....my(48m) wife(44f) is going to be shocked. **\*\*\*update\*\*\***(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

so, wife and i have been together 17 years.  we are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  about two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  so off we got to the gp, who gives us a consult to a rheumatologist.  come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  fast forward to a month ago, when our north texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  she woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were huge, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  and even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  so, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  so, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from ireland and custom designed, and have words in gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  she was absolutely gutted.  i assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but i could tell, to her, it was.

begin sherlock holmes mode.  i googled until i couldn't google anymore.  i was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  i searched some more.  i finally found his personal facebook page, and i message him, and wait......and wait......

i finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  i express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  i go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  she tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

fast forward a couple of weeks.  i get a message on facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  she explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and molds in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  she sent pictures, and i confirmed that yes - those are our rings!  she said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

i open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  of our rings.  she went ahead and had her brother, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  i asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and i was allowed to keep my old one.  she told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  i asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

our ""new"" wedding bands will be here thursday.

trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has no idea any of this took place.

\*edit - i rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her i was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  the absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to not tell her as we tell each other everything.  so now i not only need to figure out how to do this, but not to spill the beans until then.  (our friends nicknamed us mickey and mallory as well as marshall and lilly from ""how i met your mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*edit 2 - i thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where i actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (va nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so always goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when i originally proposed, i waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*edit 3 - and to those of you saying ""i"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  she is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  she is the reason i breathe, and supported all of us when i went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  she is my hero.  i wake up every day to earn her all over again.  this was one small thing i was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why i have a heartbeat.  and i don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if i seem sappy.  if a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

tl;dr wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, i went hardy boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"update: my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place nsfw. link to original(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxr0sp/my_childhood_friend_went_through_my_boyfriends/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

#that ""half blurred nude"" everyone's talking about is rick astley. please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#the other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. please read the post before commenting.

so a couple things have happened in the last few days, and i figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

first, i'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. he is just as much a victim of a crime as i am, if not more. this has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. he is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

it's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

i spoke to a lawyer...and my dad. the lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **if** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

anyways. monday, i got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. the first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". she would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

in my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. it also matters that there are two victims.

the police spoke to the people whose names i provided, most of which confirmed that sarah had shared the photos. they'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

that all made both me and john happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(all of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

so i turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. i spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. then i paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""under construction"". then i registered john and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""content pending copyrights"".

then. i posted on facebook.

""recently, someone i consider a friend broke into john's phone and stole images. she then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

not only am i disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed john in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. this person did not come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

had i actually been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. how horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

in actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

most of you know me as an entrepreneur; i own a small business, i pick up freelance jobs, i dabble in several money making ventures. none of this is a consistent income, so john and i have been brainstorming on how i could possibly generate a passive income. 

so we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. we had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and john's name was dragged through the dirt.

shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

because of this person and all who participated, i have had to out john and myself as sex workers. i've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn dad. shame on all of you.

from this point on, any person sharing these copyrighted images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

if anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

thank you.""

since then, i've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on facebook.

sarah tried to call but i hit ignore and texted her, ""you may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. she hasn't responded.

all in all, i'd say that things are looking up. sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. john's name is clear legally. important people in my life know that i'm not being abused. 

people are reaching out to john to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

so that's good, i guess.

i want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

edit: to everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

i submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. i wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

i was, an still am, angry. so i got shit done.

*edit edit*: **i am not releasing the videos.**

**another edit**: since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, this is where i got my information(https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#final edit:

this is getting out of hand so i'll be logging off. people asked for an update, so they got it.

copied from a comment i posted:

nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting sarah arrested.

my lawyer told me that, no, john could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, i could go ahead and post on facebook to try to control the narrative. 

he *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. as of now, i've achieved everything i wished to do. the police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

i don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",8
"update: my (21) little sister (12) was given 1-3 weeks to live. what can i do to make her enjoy her last days?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5idc1/my_21_little_sister_12_was_just_given_13_weeks_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

final update:

i first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. i got a lot more responses than i had thought i would, so i apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

my sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on september 1st. it's been a very hard couple of days and i've been grieving, as has my family. 

we were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. i was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. she was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

i wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. she normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. we will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

my family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. she will always be in our hearts and i know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice i was given.",8
"my (20f) boyfriend (21m) wouldn't pay for my meal when i forgot my wallet. basically the title. 

usually on dates, we split the bill. i don't really care like in the past, i've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. like we'd go back and forth. 

my current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. from the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. i was fine with it, i didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. paying on a date is sweet to me and i like it but i have my own job so it's whatever. i figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

anyway i didn't really have any problem with it. but we went out to some random spot. like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. so he went down the line and he got his own meal. i ordered mine and then when i went into my bag, i realized i forgot my wallet at my house. i told him that i forgot it by accident and i thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

i was just like what the fuck..? this guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and i paid him back through cashapp. after we ate, i lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city. 

how messed up is that? like why is he so cheap. a random stranger paid for me and he wouldn't",8
"update: i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone.. it's been a long night. thank you all for staying patient. also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

first off i just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. i'm still trying to work through all of your pm's because i'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. i have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. i never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if i can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice i used from reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon cp and find this thread (at least in canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

i also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, i understand. this is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as i wish i had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary karma, i don't. to provide proof i have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what i have written.

yesterday i was picked up by my best friend alex around 2:30. we drove around and talked for a while. i went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. we drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. david was home, in my room, and immediately i noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. he said he had to admit something to me. i prepared for him to admit to possessing cp but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. i feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. he  said no. i asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. i don't know why i was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the cp but i really thought he'd admit to it then and there. instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. he asked me if that changed my perception of him and i said no. he grew quiet again and i left to go shower. when i came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. it was about 1030 at this point. when he left, i finally lost it and broke down. i grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. i was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

i grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency rcmp line for my city. shaking and crying i explained to the lady on the phone that i had discovered cp on my boyfriend's phone. she put me through to the report line and i spoke to another constable who told me i would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. i waited for around 10 minutes. the officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. i asked if i could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, crown counsel has clear evidence that i was not coerced into stating what i witnessed. i don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time i wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if david was there and if i could safely leave without arousing suspicion. luckily david knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so i made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. david didn't seem to question it and i waited for the officer to arrive. 

he called me from a blocked number and i walked outside and down the block to his suv. the constable and another officer greeted me,  i got into the front seat and we drove to the station. during the ride i asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. he explained that i had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying david. he said if i had taken david's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. it was about 11:15 at this point. they placed me in an interview room and i sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. the officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. he said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 he started off by asking me details about my life, where i grew up, past employment etc. after that portion he asked me about david, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else i knew about him. i told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but i did express that things had been moving very quickly. he agreed. he then got me to explain how i came upon the photos in question, so i did. then came the worst part. he asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos i explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. it was intense but by some grace of god i was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and i was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. he asked me if i would testify in court and i said i would. the officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. the full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

after i had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. they explained how the process would go and whether i wanted a no contact agreement.  i said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. that made sense to me so i chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

we got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. i told them i was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (i didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. i've never felt so anxious in my life. i asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. about 15 minutes later i saw them bringing david out in handcuffs. my heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. i curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told i could go back inside. after another eternity (my phone had died by this point but i know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. i was told by the officer i could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. the officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that i did a brave thing and to be well. 

i went back into my house, put planet earth on for background noise and called my other best friend paige who had been keeping up with me about this since i sent her my reddit post. we were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. it was david. he was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. my jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and i was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. paige asked me if everything was okay and i told her david had walked through the door, i would call her back. immediately david came to the bed where i was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. he said he didn't know i would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. he asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. i lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. he sobbed more and loudly said ""that isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who i am"" and cried more and more. his body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. it was immensely difficult to witness and i wish i could have told him to get the fuck out but i just sat there immobilized, in shock. it was well close to 5 in the morning and i hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

david began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. i asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. he said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. i asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. he said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. i nodded. i asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. he admitted they were very explicit photos and i asked how he even found them; i don't recall we ever got to that. he promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but i don't really believe that. he apologized to me more times than i could count and asked if i hated him. i told him i wasn't sure that i felt hatred for him but i was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; i told him how terribly i felt betrayed and hurt and violated. i expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

then i heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. three officers were outside, two of whom i recognized from earlier and they asked me if david was here. i said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because paige had called in. i realized i had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know i was okay, bless her heart. the officers took david outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. i told them i was okay; that i would finish my discussion with him and if i had any issues i had them on speed dial. they nodded and left. 

david sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and i just sat and well, endured it. tears just ran and ran and ran from him. he said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure i expected to hear this great big apology. he said if i thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what i had to go through. i just nodded. there was silence for a long time, i think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. i don't know how long i stared at my tv screen that said ""are you still watching: planet earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. i had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. i think david was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. i didn't know or care, i was just numb. i would have probably sat like that until i died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. i got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. my brain wasn't capable of thought so i stared at my tv screen until i passed out sometime around 9. 

i didn't sleep for long because when i woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. david was awake and crying still. when he realized i was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. i just stared at him. he started apologizing and apologizing more. he expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that i was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. he expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. i shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. at this point i finally asked him to leave. i told him i needed space to sort out my emotions, and i needed to get some sleep.  i asked him if he would be okay. he nodded and grabbed his things. he said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what i wanted him to do. i said nothing. he expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. he said i love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

i've been laying in bed since then and writing this. i just want this to be over. i just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. also i think i forgot to add that his court date is set for june. as far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography i believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  i will post updates again if i feel  they are important; otherwise i will update again in june when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. i have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and i would have been so lost without some of your advice. i'll continue working on replying to your pm's, but in the meantime i think i'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

tldr: filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested david and seized his phone. he signed a promise to appear in court in june. he awaits sentencing.

"wife told me she wanted to experiment, i obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.. throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. my (28m) wife (26f) and i have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. we had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. however, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". she has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. my wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". at first i thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. i had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days i obliged.

that next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. we were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. however, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. i was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but i agreed.

this is when things took an extreme turn. during this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. i had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""i want your shit"". i pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""i want you to shit on me"". i pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. i felt like a fucking dick because she thought i was kinkshaming her. in a way, i was because i thought the request was far too extreme. i ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

after that incident, my wife and i hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. at the end of the week, i asked my wife to talk about what happened. she told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. i thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. i couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

we fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, i tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. i told her that i will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. she was so happy and even though i was still completely nauseated by this desire, i wanted to satisfy her.

that brings us to tonight. we were having sex for the first time this week when i (regrettably) confessed to her that i had to take a shit. she perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. i still really didn't want to go through with it, but since i had promised her i pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

she got into the bathtub and i hung my ass over the side of the tub. i started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. i turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. with enough time, i was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. i could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. however, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, i felt a sensation around my asshole.

i turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. i was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

as i clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and i heard it land somewhere beneath me. i was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so i ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. as i was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how i will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, i heard footsteps approaching. my wife lightly knocked on the door. i didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more i thought about what just happened. she walked away and then i got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

i've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. we have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but i don't think i can look at her after what she did to me. i feel deceived and violated by the woman i love and trust. during our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. she knew how uncomfortable i was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

i would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. i'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, i cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and i. i know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to go to the front page, but my wife has seen the post. i have been unable to face her and there is no way to get out of going to the zoo with the other family today.  i appreciate all the serious feedback and i will update tonight.",8
"i think i got reverse catfished last night. i matched with this girl on tinder. she was significantly bigger than girls i normally date. but we have literally everything thing in common so i figured i'd give it a shot. so after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

but she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. i'm not sure how i should proceed.

edit: i didn't expect this to be downvoted so much. i guess people just prefer the standard ""i just walked in on my fiance and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis' inside her at the same time. should i still go through with the wedding?""",8

&#x200b;

super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

i wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love i received from people in this sub i feel like the least i can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. before i begin i just want to thank everyone who gave advice, i didn't respond to everyone but i read almost every response. i stopped reading my pm's because a lot of the messages i was getting were graphic and negative but i appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and i'm sorry if i didn't respond to you. now on to the update: 

it's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. my bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time i decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. i felt like everything i needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. his sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

we spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. he told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while i was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when i first suggested it. he said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (i don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when i brought up his tattoo. obviously i knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but i must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because i never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

i was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. he regrets the tattoo and discovering i wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. he apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. he completely understood where i was coming from when i brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

i apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what i meant and was very forgiving. he apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

we then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

up until now i was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. apparently she felt like i was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

if that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. we're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

my bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. she was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. we've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

in the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. in the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. i'm a fan of this idea as well. 

as for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. i don't think he should, i feel like he's lost enough family but i'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

i think that just about wraps everything up. a huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

i mean this in the nicest way possible when i say i hope i never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - we both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. we're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",8
"my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. hi, everyone. this will probably be lengthy as i have nobody in my life to talk to about this. this is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

my wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. we have been together for 11 years and married for 8. she has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. she previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. we also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

the following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""standard operating procedures"" of our household:

&#x200b;

* if i touch a light switch i need to wash my hands
* if i touch a door knob i need to wash my hands
* if i go to the garage i need to take a shower before i      can sit down or do anything
* if i touch her pajamas or i touch towels then i need to      take a shower
* if i *even enter* the guest bathroom then i have      to take a shower
* if my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* i am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* she stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much tp as a regular person would).      the cleaning process is 3 chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. i have to immediately shower after this.
* if she spills excess *water* on the floor then i      have to mop it and anywhere i walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where i walked after stepping in the water.
* she goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. she washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. if she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. if,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      if her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. she discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. she uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" as you can see, this adds up      and i end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. this doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* if i change out laundry and **i graze the doorframe** when i enter the bedroom with clothes, i have to discard all of them.
* if an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* if i even *touch* the dishwasher i have to wash my      hands.
* if she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will not      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. this means if she is hungry or thirsty i will bring it to her.
* her showers last around 40 minutes. she bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. our water bill is ridiculous.
* if my son (2 yo) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. this includes      naps. if i take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* when i clean the house (which i dont mind, btw.      cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. no deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200b;

1. change out laundry and leave washer free
2. wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. sanitize all counters
6. clean kids bathroom
7. take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. take shower
12. put bathroom rugs in washer
13. take shower
14. sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. mop house in very specific order
16. take shower

i want to make this clear - i have no problem with cleaning but i often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and i get berated. my wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. often, i have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so i will be doing it after midnight. of course i will make mistakes when i am mentally exhausted.

&#x200b;

* if i bring her water, i have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. she thinks that      if i hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. i do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* if i have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. she thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. this is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* if my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. he gets out often because she wont close the door.
* my wife **will not touch doorknobs**. she uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* if i leave the house with my phone, i cannot bring it      back into the house until i sanitize it. that includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* no shoes on the in house, ever. i had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. i had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop twice where they walked.
* her depth perception is abysmal. we get in so many      fights because she thinks that i touched her with a dirty object when i      was *halfway across the room.* when she gets dressed, i half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. same with pants.
* we never have people over because of her fear of      infection. plus, i am the one who has to clean and sanitize so i am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

there is more things i have to deal with but i cannot remember every situation right now. the worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). i have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. i wash my hands over 50 times a day. i have gotten to the point where i just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. i fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. i get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. and this is not because of my kids.

you may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" we did that about two months ago. my dad may be the only person who really knows what i am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. that is exactly what i did. i told the counselor everything that i just revealed to all of you. i have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" the counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. my wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. after the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

i want to say one last thing. before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. we loved each other and felt we were meant to be. i still love her and want it to work. i have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. i am physically and mentally exhausted. i have thought of leaving multiple times but i am afraid of how it will affect my kids. we also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. my wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (i dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? thank you for taking the time to read and i appreciate any and all advice.

**tl;dr** \- my wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

&#x200b;

edit:  i want to make something clear.  my children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  they dont do what i do - that is the one thing i absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  but yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  i talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how i feel - again.  she broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  when i get home we will continue to address this.

"i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. update here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200b;

groom and i had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. i'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because i've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. in fact, since knowing him, i've talked him through each of his break ups. we've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, i helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. i'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. i've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

a month after his engagement, groomsman invitational boxes went out. we have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. of the original high school group, i was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. this obviously stung, but i maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. it triggered my depression for a solid month where i questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the groom and i had a talk.

he said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which i'm sure it was. he told me that i was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the bride would not sign off on my involvement. apparently, i had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. she'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). i'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. he said it was tearing him up inside, and i believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. he said that he'd let her know that i knew about how she felt towards me and that i'd be reaching out to talk about it. so i messaged the bride through text and dm, saying (paraphrased), ""hey! i'm so sorry if anything i've said has upset you. can we meet sometime and talk? i'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" the bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final groomsmen invitation box goes out to another friend.

fast forward to a few weeks ago, the bride, groom, and i are hanging out. groom and i are talking, and i'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so i ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. the conversation leads us here...

groom: hey man, i wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

me: sure. what's up?

groom: i was wondering if you would want to usher for me? it's no big deal if you can't, but i want you to be there for me if you can, you know? like, be a part of the wedding.""

me (very touched): yeah! of course i can, dude. anything for you two.

groom: thank you so much. you know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. i know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

me: i'll have to see if i can leave work early, but i'm already there, man. thanks for thinking of me!

a week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so i shoot him a text saying, ""hey man! big day's this weekend. just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. i got the time off with my boss, so i can definitely make it. just let me know."" he returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""yeah man, we would still like you to usher. i'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. thanks for helping us out!"" i'm a little put out, but i persevere. at least he asked me to be an usher. that's something, right?

morning of the wedding comes around and i'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time i should show up to the reception to start helping. then bride messages me asking for a favor. these messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages i had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. can i do this for a bride, on her wedding day? sure. oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **sure.**

at this point i should have stopped and asked myself, ""why am i helping so much? why didn't i ask for their money up front? should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" hindsight. 20/20. with the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while i go pick up the appetizers. thank god i played as much tetris as i have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. i text the bride to let her know we've got everything together and i'd see them at the reception. once again, left on read.

i get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. i find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. the venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. so i have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

since guests were already seating themselves, i immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. it was a fucking mess. at one point, i was so down about the situation that i literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" to start, the place cards were in no discernible order. they were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. i should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. we weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. the best part is, i say ""we"" because at this point i met my ushering-peers; they were the grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (i'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. when i asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. we did this at the wedding last year.""

after finding out that, to the groom, i was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. they ask me to stay for a drink, but i can't because i'm still ushering. as i step back behind the name card table, i take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. to my right, i see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. i look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and i wonder, how did i get here?

wedding kicks off & in the rare instance i can speak to bride & groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. i also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should i do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  i'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when i walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. i can understand this. maybe they're burned out. maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the groom approaches me.

groom: hey, thanks again for your help. i was wondering if i could borrow you again?

me: what's up?

groom: did you drive here? we have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

me: ... how far is the hotel?

groom: 10 minutes away.

me (for a groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... sure.

get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, i'm hungry. groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. he goes to get changed, i say i'm gonna grab food & come back. groom asks for food for he & bride. i say sure. bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. sure. then she asks the room at large who'd like food. now i'm buying food for almost the whole after party. cousin says she'll venmo me when i get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **sure.**

come back, cousin is passed out. drunken guests grab whatever food they see. groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. i grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. at this point, i'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that i never really had a best friend to begin with. i feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. i went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. this was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how i thought it would. i've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and i'm left wondering how i could have been such a chump, and how many other times i'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

the advice i'm hoping for is, how can i go about expressing how terrible a time i had at his wedding without insulting him, if i should do that at all, how can i develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? also, i feel like the missing puzzle piece is the bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what i did to her. i know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. how can i start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? should i just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200b;

tl;dr ""best friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

&#x200b;

update: wow. thank you for your overwhelming response to this. i want to thank everyone who took the time to share with me, be it positive or negative. i really feel like i need to hear it all before i make a next move, and i'm especially grateful for those of you who have extended friendship to me and those of you have been very critical of me. i'll take it all. i just want to become better than i am now. i'm legitimately reading through everything and, after work, i'll post a fleshed out update.",8
"should i (48m) tell my wife (44f) that i received a sex tape of her in the mail?. throwaway.

this is an odd thing. wife and i have been married 20 years. i've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

first of the year, i receive a package in the mail. it's a dvd addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". it's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. she was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

first i've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the dvd - none of which i know. i'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. second i've know idea why they sent it. are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? the tape isn't time stamped so i don't have a frame of reference. she kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

and also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? i know my wife had other partners. hell i had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago i think we're past that. but apparently this person or persons isn't.

the whole thing is strange. i'm not sure what's going on. i haven't told my wife, i'm not sure how she would take it. she's very sexual and adventurous but i don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. but i don't think i'll get to the bottom of this unless i tell her.

edit - update. i'm overwhelmed by the responses. thank you for your interest.

i did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. some mentioned letting her watch it in private and i gave her that option. she did and we talked at length. some of it is a bit clearer now.

the two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. that's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  i asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

the other is a boyfriend she dated when her and i met, before we actually started dating. she knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

why?

she admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on facebook. when she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. she thinks he sent the dvd to cause an issue with us.

for the first time i now have doubts. her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. and honestly i may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - i know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. also she didn't seem shaken by the dvd or the fact i had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. i had the idea she'd rather i didn't have it but now that i did, oh well. 

it still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the dvd was made in 2013 but i'm just getting it now? that many be minor but it may be everything. plus how does this gentleman know where i live - facebook doesn't give you that information. being in contact with someone does so now you see why i have doubts.

thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. i love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. i will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

edit ii - i want to clarify something. i've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that i'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. none of my business, it was 20 years ago i should man up, that sort of thing.

look, i said it was hard to take. most men understand their partner was with different people before them. but seeing their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. i didn't say i was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. it's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. i'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. and for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" i challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. frustrated at best. you won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. so thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position i'll ignore you thank you very much .

final edit - this will be my final edit. thank you all for your support but all i will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. i hacked into my wife's facebook account - childish and immature i'll admit but i did it nonetheless. and i found things disturbing enough that i need to think long and hard about what i do next. i've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and i'm questioning her more than ever before. heartbroken is putting it mildly. it's time for me to work on my life and my self. thanks to everyone and their interest .",8
"update i (28m) think my girlfriend (26f) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.. link to previous post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=jqrwkq4d&sh=e1753ed8)

i finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. a lot of things that i never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

as soon as she opened the door to our apartment, i could tell that she was already starting to cry. seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because i didn't want to put her in that position. 

i had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

we sat down, there were lots of tears. i thought i would be bitter, angry and that i would be screaming at her the whole time but i felt disappointed instead. 

i told her that i saw the messages and explained how i ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

she kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

then i told her that we go more way back than they ever did. i was there through her lowest point, i helped her get up.

she admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

i saw it coming, i had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. at that point, i was full on crying. i can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. it still is now. 

i remember telling her that i was done, that whatever we had was over. she kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, i don't think i ever will. i can't tolerate people who cheat.

by that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

when i posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. his place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. he'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that i can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

we both agreed that i don't mention him in this post. i'm glad that i really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

it's almost 3am, i'm heartbroken as ever but i'm trying my best. i'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. i'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

to all my aussie mates,  if you live near/around chapel hill, let me know! 

america, you were great but now it's time to come home. thanks for the help everyone.

edit: i'm crying again, not because i got cheated on but because i realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. i almost can't believe i looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. i am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

i may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but i gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

other than that, i am feeling better. it still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? she made her choice so i made mine. 

i woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that i shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

it sucks that i may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. i thanked them and said that although i believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so i junked it straight away. 

i miss her like crazy. i know it will take a lot of time to heal me but i guess i can wait. 

ps. i'll message my newfound aussie friends when i go through all the comments. exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but i'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

"my (19f) boyfriend (20m) broke up with me because i'm too good at sex. we've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. we took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. and after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

even after our first time, he asked me if i really was a virgin or if i lied because i was too good. no i didn't lie. i just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. since then, he'd get weird during sex. like if i did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. now i know he was questioning if i really was a virgin. 

anyway. he broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. tmi i was riding him and he said i act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy i've been with and he thinks i lied to him. i told him i watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

great. never thought i'd be dumped for being too good at sex. it just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. i want him back. i know he's just being paranoid. how do i tell him that i wasn't lying?

okay quick update: he texted me and said sorry so we're back together :)",8
"overheard my 26m fiance 24f tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort."". 

update 2: just did one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. today after breakfast i told her we should ""sit down and talk."" she was hesitant, but i said it was important. we went to the living room and she said to me ""i already know what this is about."" my post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" of course the water works started happening right away. i told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. through her tears, she said ""i was just joking, i wasn't serious."" she then went on saying stuff like ""i love you, i love you."" i told her i can't be in a marriage where my s/o doesn't love me the same way i love them. she tried to tell me that she loved me and that i meant something to her. but it was all bullshit. she said she ""didn't want to lose me."" i told her i don't think this marriage was the right decision. and from there i basically told her it was over. i told her i knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. for all those wondering, we have no kids, and i pay fully for the apartment we live in, and i own almost everything we have other then her clothes. i even pay for her car. so after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, i've never been so happy with a decision i've made in my life. after that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""fuck you."" she started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" i told her i could do whatever i wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. she screamed at me saying, ""you're the fucking worst relationship i've ever been in. you think i can't find someone again?"" ""do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? you're a fucking idiot my name."" she grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""i'm leaving!"" before slamming the door behind her. at that moment i felt like i was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of tv. i sat down on the couch and cried, and i'm still crying as i type this up. it's both happy and sad tears, and i knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. she never loved me, it was obvious. our relationship only went one way, and i feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier i live in california, and i'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. tomorrow, i'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (i'm not throwing out her stuff. just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. all of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and i know my life will certainly improve as a result.

edit/update: thanks everyone for the kind words! really has made me feel a lot better! going to be talking to her soon. also, i noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, i understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. i've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. also i used an old alt since she uses reddit. anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. i'm going to talk to her today. i will be updating you all soon after.

edit: meant to put wife in the title but now i can't change it.

basically the title. i overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while i was passing the bedroom. this friend is in a serious relationship. my wife then said to her, ""sweetie, remember it's your choice. don't settle for just anyone. that's the mistake i made. who knows who else i could of had. my name was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. does she even love me? why am i being treated as a second base? 

am i being dramatic and overreacting? i haven't said anything about it since. i honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",8
"update to: i found out i have a daughter who thinks i was her mother's rapist. it wasn't rape. what next?. ten days ago i requested advice and the post got removed after a day because i didn't use a throwra.  i'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. i alerted the moderators i would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

original

i received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a dna match and she is my biological daughter. it was a long and emotionally charged letter. she said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish i had caused her and her mother and grandparents. the letter was gut wrenching.

i was shocked but also skeptical. i have been married 25 years and i have three great kids. i have never raped or abused a woman ever! i thought this had to be a prank or scam. i had done home dna ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child i wasn't aware of. but when i logged into my account, there she was.

i did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, terry (fake name), i had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  we broke it off mutually and remained friendly. the very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. it was a casual hookup and i remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. also unprotected. afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. we both went home the next morning for summer break. terry didn't come back to college the next year, which i gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

one of the reasons terry and i were incompatible was religion. she was catholic and i'm jewish. i was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. my supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a jewish ex-boyfriend. but who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

it kills me that i have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. i can't imagine growing up thinking i was a product of rape. that has to be so hard psychologically. i am in pain for a child i didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

i have been debating what to do. i have not written back to my daughter. i badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). my wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. my best friend says i should hire a lawyer. i don't know what to do and it's eating me up. advice, please!

update

i hired a lawyer. he recommended that i respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. i wrote her a short message and described how and when terry and i met. i was careful not to attack terry and to offer sympathy. i explained that our sex was consensual. a week went by with no response.

two days ago my daughter wrote me and said terry now claims she was raped a month after she and i had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. she's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. i find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not i guess it gives terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

yesterday i spoke to my daughter for the first time. she was crying and so was i, so it wasn't easy to say much. before we hung up, i told her that i loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and i hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. she sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

my wife and i told our kids about a week ago. they are teenagers and took it really well. all three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. my wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. she has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. my daughter is going to call me again tonight and i'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. we have a lifetime of catching up to do.

meantime as for terry, i feel like my daughter and i were robbed, but i really don't want to dwell on it. she hasn't reached out to me and i don't plan to either, though i'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.


edit:  i'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from reddit. thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. really, really.
i promise i will post an update!

"update: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.. original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

i'll post the update first, since there has been some change since i last posted. then i'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of pms i received.

yesterday, i received a call from my gf. she was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. i told her that i still care for her, and that i'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

she told me that a few days after i told her we were done, she called up her mother to talk about this. apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that i was actually manipulating her to do so. her mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

after i left her, my gf called her mum up to talk about what went on. my gf said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. my gf said she broke down on the phone, and her mother kept asking her what she will do. the conversation then ended when my gf said she didn't know.

then she started texting. after a few hours of thinking, my gf sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. she was then blocked.

my gf then called me, and told me everything.

she will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

i discussed this with my gf, and we both completely agreed that i had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that i put my foot down, because had i not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (her words, not mine)

she further went on to say that i am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a mum, if she had me, she could get through this. i broke down at this point.

i love her so much. in truth, i probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though i knew i'd resent it. i made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if i had made the right decision.

i'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

also, screw any mother who places religion over their own child. friggin lunatics.


now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: no. my gf did not cheat on me. i am almost certain about this. not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. moreover, her roommate took photos of my gf after she came home assaulted. it's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: i don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my gfs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: my gf was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the mum).

4: thanks for all the people telling me i did the right thing. it was really difficult. i'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: to the people who pm'd me telling me i'm a monstrous baby killer - i fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

thanks reddit.",8
"my(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. i need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.. i'm actually an immigrant from mexico, so my english is average at best. 

i must admit that i was really homophobic and racist growing up. that was how i was raised. but when i moved to america, i met my wife and she helped me a lot. she helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. i owe that to my wife.

yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. so we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. it took some time to sink in, but i understood. when i asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. she asked me if i was fine with it and i told her that i had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. i must admit that i felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

after that, i asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. she told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. i'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. so i started to get ready to prepare it. 

at this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. and when i came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. my daughter was crying and i was really shocked. i asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. she told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

i asked my wife to leave, because i was really angry. after my wife left i told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and i'll stand by her. my daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

now, my wife refuses to talk to me. she told me that she will be back only if i agree to help my daughter become straight. idk what to make out of this. i'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. i love both of them very much and i'd like to help diffuse this situation. can i get some advice here?",8
"update: my (21m) girlfriend (21f) went on an anti semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. i'm jewish.... op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


i figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. this all happened a few days ago. 

the day i made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. well, that didn't turn out well. 

before i told her about my background, i asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards jews. she pretty much sounded like hans landa the whole time. at one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a jewish student. 

afterwards i bluntly told her that i'm jewish. she didn't believe me at all and thought i was joking. i told her that i was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. this went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

when it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. things went 0-100 very fast. she got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. she said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. when she insulted me i reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. she cried hysterically and i left. 

the next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that she dumped me and not the other way around.  she warned me not tell people that i dumped her since that would make her look bad. i didn't say anything and closed the door. i heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare i close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". after a while she left and started writing me on snapchat. i blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. i've never seen her act so crazy. 

long story short, i blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. i knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but i didn't know it would be this bad. some of her stuff is still at my place. oh well 


**tl;dr told her, broke up with her.**",8
"my (18f) best friend (18f) cheated on her boyfriend (21m), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. should i tell him?. ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. also i know this is pretty fucked up but natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

we graduated high school this summer so our friends and i all went on a small vacation to italy. we found a groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. natalie is dating eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. it was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. it's pretty well known among us friends that dylan who is in our high school, likes natalie. he's like really into her. well when we all went to europe, since eric wasn't there, natalie was all over dylan. acting like a couple, being all flirty. they'd sleep in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. well, i shared a room with natalie and i walked in on them having sex. afterwards i asked her what she was doing since she was dating eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. it was not. we were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. dylan's dreams came true that week. but only i knew about it since it was our room. everyone else had their suspicions but i was the only one who really knew the truth. 

when we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on eric again. she kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. so i promised to keep her little fling a secret. fucked up i know but i have more loyalty to natalie than eric. 

she continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and i asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if i slapped her across the face. she said it's obviously eric and i reminded her about dylan and she insisted that eric is the father and to never mention dylan in front of her again. she's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. she told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. he wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

y'all. dylan is obviously the father. like 100%. they were fucking like rabbits in italy and i don't think she knew how to say ""where can i buy condoms"" in italian. i feel bad for eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

i love natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like i feel really bad for eric. i know she's scared and eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. but it's not fair for him. i know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

i don't know like if i tell eric, natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",8
"my 33m fiancee 27f chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. how can i ever repay her?. two nights ago, my fiancee accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. the fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. i wasn't home, so i wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. if i was, i would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. it's just stuff. 

she chose differently. first, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. then she went back in. at this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. she knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

both of us have lost parents. i lost my dad 3 years ago. he was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before i actually met her. i have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom i have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. she lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

i don't even know how to begin to say thank you. i'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and i can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. i don't know how to repay her. or where to begin. can anybody think of a nice gesture i can make it up to her? she must be devastated. i can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

tl;dr: my fiancee had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. how do i repay her?",8

short update because i'm supposed to be working. and i don't expect this to get attention because my original post didn't but i don't know who else to tell. 

the day after i posted originally, i told her i'm in love with her, and asked her on a ""real date"". it went well. really well, so easily and just good. and she slept next to me again that night.. i got to kiss her in public! she said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

i am going to take everyone's advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but i want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. because everything just makes sense now. 

and yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

"caught my girlfriend cheating and i cannot cope please help. so long story short i found texts on my(18m) gf(19) phone tonight texting her friend things like ""he pounded my shit"" ""i got some of the best dick last night"" and ""omg it was so good, i couldn't walk last night""

i'm disgusted.  it was her ex, whom i've always felt inferior too like she just hadn't gotten over him even after over a year.

i'm distraught.  i don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  my two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.  my family and i don't even get along nor communicate much.  i lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

she's really sorry.  i saw her crying when she didn't know i could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  i feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  i had to do it.  i told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

but fuck this sucks.  i have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and i just don't know how to cope with this.  i can't eat.  i can't sleep and i have class in the morning.  i keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and i'm just disgusted.  i'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  i know in a while i'll be ok but i just don't know how to get from part a to part b.

please help




edit:  wow.  i don't even know what to say.  guys thank you so much for the overwhelming support.  i get a new notification telling me to be strong literally every three seconds.

i finally fell asleep at 7 am and there were like 40 comments on this.  i woke up and there are over 800 beautiful people telling me to be strong.  thank you so much.  reddit is such a beautiful place.  in the strangest way, i feel really capable of surmounting this today as opposed to yesterday.  you guys definitely played a part in that.

this is the kind of stuff that makes me remember not everyone sucks lmao.  keep up being great in life guys :)

thank you from the bottom of my heart!


edit2:  jesus guys!  you're all a blessing!  i just finished class and i've been getting notifications every three seconds!  going to do my best to get back to everyone.

i am doing much, much better.  i'm feeling freed rather than sorry for myself now.  thank you all.

by far the most frequent advice was to hit the gym.  i'm going to dinner rn but i'm hitting the iron directly after!

on top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, i've had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching sat prep was praised for ""outstanding qualifications""

-  i got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that i've been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

i'm doing well, thank you all, you're all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you're all worth a platinum in my eyes!

cheers!


edit3:  i can't believe i forgot to say, my exgf!

i did it guys :)

"update: i (21m) got my fwb (33f) pregnant and she's keeping it, i want to talk to her about other options.. this is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

well some time has passed.. and a lot has happened. my first post had a lot of comments and i got some pm's from people asking me what went down so that's why i'm updating.

so i didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because i realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. i didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and i shouldn't have done that. but i needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever i was going to decide would change my life so i needed some space, though i could have communicated a bit more (which i'm working on now).

anyways, i realized that i'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. i was stuck on the age gap, i kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when i thought of her. some comments really stuck with me and i decided to just trust my feelings. i ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. she was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how i felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. i'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. she completely lit up when i told her, i saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. she was ecstatic, i won't ever forget that. 

every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. i really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. we talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and i don't understand how it has all been so amazing. i know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. i moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, i had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. she has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. they got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. on top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl i've introduced them to. the pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. i'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, i'm really close with my parents. they are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. they fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

she's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. i've been trying to help her and support her any way i can, and did a ton of reading online to understand what's going on. i offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that i can keep going. we need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

so yeah... i'm going to a dad. she's gonna give birth to our kid.. still feels surreal to me, but i'm low-key kinda excited. it'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. i'm happy that i'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

edit: i don't need any pm's full of criticism, don't bother. just comment somewhere if you want to spit some nonsense",8
"wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"". this is all over the place. i really need help.

my wife and i (m42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

all this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. after some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

we were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. ofcourse i was super happy . 

a week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. the test came back negative and ofcourse i was devastated but she wasn't. she claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. we took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. my wife is in complete denial. now she claims we are having twins. she is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

i am at a loss and don't know what to do. my inaction is making her believe that i want to leave them and that i am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

what the f is even happening. i love her but i don't know what to do.

edit : forgott to add. i have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

**little update/edit:** thank you guys you really helped me out. yesterday was a bad day and you helped me get clarity. i've had a chat with our doctor who will now be handling this with us. i would like to thank most of you with useful advice and hopefully i will be able to update good news someday. but a fuck you to those that said i should divorce her because she is ""crazy"" and an extra fuck you to the guy that used this post to push his anti abortion agenda.",8
"my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby. really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my gf was raped. it was done in a park. she didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. i couldn't force her, so i just stayed with her.

she was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and i've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. we went to therapy, and she knows i'm there for her. she has a history of depression, and i've been really worried.

last week, we found out she was pregnant. i was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. so the baby definitely isn't mine. she is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

so we had a discussion. she is a devout catholic. we initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

i flat out told her that i would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. she cried and begged me not to leave. i told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and i leave, or she aborts the baby and i stay. i would not let this go.

she didn't want either of those things to happen, so i told her we were done...

i feel shit. was i wrong?",8
"i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i don't know what to say to her.. hey everyone. i don't know what to do in this situation because i never expected i'd face something like this. i'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but i'm coming up seriously short here.

i met my wife on tinder at the end of 2015. we talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. by the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. we were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. more than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

i know, heavy topics for a first date. we were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

at the very least i held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. she immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

we dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. after getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

four nights ago was the first time i ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. my wife was out with a friend, and i was doing some house cleaning. i was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so i took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. at the bottom i saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case b were visible. i immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

i had known that my wife was on her period because when i tried to initiate sex, she told me so. i found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and i made comment about the timing being odd. she told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. i figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

i haven't told her that i found the box. when she got home that night everything was so normal. i tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

the more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. what if she was assaulted? what if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? what if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? or, what if she just cheated? i only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of plan b and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

i don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. we have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. i've done nothing to displease her, at least that i know of. maybe i'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than i'm giving it credit for. but i feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because i don't know how.

**tl;dr** i found a torn up plan b box in my trash. the only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. how do i bring this up?",8
"update 2: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving. i am making this as i feel i owe it to all of you. the amount of pm's and responses have been incredible. many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. both the negative and positive comments have helped me and i would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

yesterday i was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. the only person i responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. i didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

during the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as i need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). my plans have changed a bit, i am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend i was supposed to go to. i called him up and let him know i want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but i know i will be leaving for somewhere. he said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. we will see how that turns out...

later in the day i responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since i sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
i picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. i could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. she kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. she i have misunderstood the entire situation... i could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). anyway i told her to explain it to me right then and there. she said because i only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that i should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. during the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
after she told me its all a misunderstanding i told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
after i hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). it didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. she said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. i was just quiet during most of it. the more i didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

she started telling me i can fuck other women if i want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
i told her fucking other woman was not something i needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
the sister was telling her stuff in the background but i couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

she kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. after that she started saying something but i just hung up. 

for like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. he told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that i always will be welcome to him and that i am a good guy. his wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. she tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. i politely tell her i appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

my ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. she then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
she kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and i didnt say much.

after some time i just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. she starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that i said i would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. i told the sister i only said i think about it, and now that i have i realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. she then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
the only thing i said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". after this i just hung up.

my phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. i dont plan on responding. i honestly feel alot better right now, like i can move on. i will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. if someting more happens i will update this post.

maybe i will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

i dont know when i feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, i am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

thanks!

edit 1: thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold i appreciate the support alot. i however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

i would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. i am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

also i dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity i dont mind answering them.

i also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). in a month? when i am back from vacation?

once again thanks for all the support

edit 2: my friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that i have to pick it up by myself. i dont know why she is still acting like this. i am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.",8
"update from the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on christmas. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  my girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

i posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. it got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and i was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and i fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the big talk.

little did i know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. i didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. so thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, i got a dreaded ""we need to talk"" text. yep, all caps. and i was like ""welp, i'm dead.""

she was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). still, she said i had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and i agreed/apologized. she knows i'm writing this update and she's going to read it before i post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

we talked for a long time thursday night. she said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. it's partially a cultural thing, according to her. gf was born and raised in the u.s. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. she said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. she grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

on top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. she said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. she also got very little affection from her parents growing up. it seems like that was all replaced with material things. so, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

all that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. she was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. she was really hurt that i said i thought i was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and i said i was sorry, and i am. i was still raging a little when i wrote that. i asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. it wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

we've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. i'm totally fine this. we've been together for almost 3 years and i think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. she's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. we spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. it's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. i'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. no one can change their habits overnight.

we're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. the plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. she also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. it's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. we're going to give it until my lease is up in march (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. she isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before march.

tl:dr: thanks, reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. i did and i think things are going to get better.

edit

to everyone who's wondering, her parents are from mexico.

gf has a job and her own income. she is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. you're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. in that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. that's now just out there for the whole world to read. you can't say that wouldn't be alarming. she said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. all things considered, i think she was pretty reasonable about it. ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure i thanked reddit for the perspective. no, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. she's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",8
"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong.. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

tl;dr: my friends are acting like i was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",8
"update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met. this is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

as a quick summary: i thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""joe"" and his wife ""kate."" after just a couple weeks, she was trusting joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to maggie's family thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. i thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or maggie had attachment issues.

i figured out what was going on and i feel like a huge idiot. i went to see maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if i didn't like what i heard i'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue i couldn't handle.

i had the opportunity when i saw the gifts maggie had gotten for joe and kate's kids. it seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

i asked maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to joe and kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for christmas.

i wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then maggie said that she used to exchange christmas gifts with joe and kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

i realized i was missing something important. if maggie had other christmases with joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like i thought. i had thought that maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but i didn't think maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. i didn't want to ask, so i acted normally until i left.

when i got home, i went through maggie's facebook. she wasn't lying and she's not crazy. i found a ton of photos with joe and kate going back a decade. from what i can figure out, they all went to college together, joe and maggie were big brother and little sister in a coed frat/sorority, and maggie and kate were roommates. i also found pictures of maggie as a bridesmaid in joe and kate wedding and pictures of maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. all of maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that i know all this.

i think this whole thing is my fault. i have adhd and i don't handle it well. i've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where i start zoning them out. i've been called out for this before. i think it's pretty likely that maggie did tell me about joe and kate and i just wasn't listening. maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so i think it's more likely that i wasn't listening when maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

this was a pretty big wakeup call for me. i've been ignoring my problem because i didn't want to face facts that it was serious but i know i need to do something before i make anymore mistakes. i'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",8
"girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 kennedy half dollars to buy drugs. my girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. he lives with us (we are both late 20's and have ft jobs).

i have been stacking 1964 kennedy half dollars for ten years now. for those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

i had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

i insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like i mentioned. whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. and according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? what then?

she also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". i collect them partially for a store of value incase of inflation or deflation, but i also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

i guess i'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. it also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",8
"update: i 24f am dating a 25m almost unreasonably picky eater and i'm pretty much at the end of my rope. previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

this happened last night.

&#x200b;

this update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than i had hoped but it is what it is. i read what you all wrote and i appreciate all the comments left for me. despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that i'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

i decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. he needed help and so long as i saw that he was trying that was all i asked for. we were out to dinner (i'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" i was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but i figured now was as good a time as any: 

me: maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. maybe you can just try new german cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

j: no way. i have people depending on me to continue this streak. i don't want to let them down.

me: i don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, i'm worried about you. this is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. you're about to go on this incredible trip to germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. i think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

we had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. he doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how i was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. i let him know how this is my business because it affects me. we can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

we let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. the plan after was to go back to his place where i would spend the night. the entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while i wished i had just gone home. i should have gone home. i guess i didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when i got to his place.

he flipped.

he began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how i couldn't control what he did or ate. i told him i cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. i ultimately agreed that he was right, i couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that i stick around and watch and enable him like i had been doing in the past. 

it escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when i was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. i could not and still cannot dispute that. he was. i guess the only difference between him and i is that i wanted to change. i acknowledged the issue and knew i could not go on like this any longer. obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. one spirals much faster than the other so i was able to recognize it much quicker. 

i told him i was going to leave because i couldn't deal with this anymore. we kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. he has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. he would be sharing it on facebook. i completely panicked. i cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. he told me if i walked out he absolutely would. 

that was all i needed to hear. he was going to blackmail me. i think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. if i leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

so i left. i don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all i care. he emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

let him post it. fuck it. i can't control other people i can only control myself and how i react. i deactivated all my social media and i'm ready to move on with my life. it hurts that somebody i trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. thank you all for reading.

"my(23f) boyfriend(25f) left me on the side of the road and i deserved it.. my amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. he was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. after we were done we left, and we were about half way home when i asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. he said something like ""haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. my stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""c'mon, please? i want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. after that i kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than i deserve, he's firm and says no. i give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. apparently i pulled harder than i thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. to make things worse, he just bought this car. the driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). they didn't even exchange any information. while he's being yelled at, i don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something i did. when he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. his entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. to try and break the tension a little, i say ""well, that could've gone a lot worse."" as soon as i say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. i've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment i did. he looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. i got out and he sped off. it was starting to get dark and i was in a stretch of woods. it took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when i got there him and all his stuff was gone.

i feel so horrible. i cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. we've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now i don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. i've been getting texts like ""wtf"" and ""what the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so i think he's told them what happened. 

it seems like everybody's mad at me. is there any way to fix this? how can i apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?",8
"i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had. it was quite by accident that i heard this.  we had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  some of us were in one room playing texas holdem and a couple of others were watching a lord of the ring marathon.  i thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  our group had run out of soda so i got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  as i'm rounding the corner i hear my fiance talking and before i completely come in the room i hear her clearly say ""jason is great but he will never be the lover that bill was"" she then followed it up with ""its not really fair to jason though, bill was just really gifted down there"".

at first i thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but i decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and i could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know i was there.  of course she has no idea i heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how i'm doing and if i'm having fun.  i was tempted to say something like ""i'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but i didn't.  i just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  i just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

needless to say it fucked me up.  i mean fucked me up bad.  i've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  i couldn't sleep that night and i went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  at first i was angry.  then i was humiliated.  then i was depressed.  then i was angry again.

look i realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  i would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

i tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on i just kept getting worse and worse.  i was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  that is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and i flat out rejected her.  it wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  i had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  but in the moment instead of being sexually aroused i felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

she asked me what was wrong and i just told her i must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

so much to my humiliation there i laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  i came clean and told her what i heard.

well this did not go over well at all.  at first she tried to tell me i did not hear her correctly.  but i just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  which once again i am sure was more of a big turn off for her because i was a wreck emotionally.

she tried to tell me how much of a better person i was and how i satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  but all i could hear was charlie browns teacher noise.

it's been almost a month and i have zero desire to be with her sexually.  none.  she is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what i have tried i just can not get past this.  it's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  she clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  well i know i can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  but no matter what i do i can't grow in size.  obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me i won't believe her.  she's most likely right.

some back story here.  he dumped her.  it was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  i know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  she said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  so this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  if he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  now i have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but i don't think she would.

i just don't know what to do here.  i can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  i know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that i think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told i am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  like what would happen if i lost my good paying job or better yet what if i were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  basically what i feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  i know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what i feel.

i'm sorry for the length here and i don't even know what i am asking here.  i am totally lost and if this continues i just think i am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and i need advice.

&#x200b;

edit:  holy god.  i made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  i have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  i don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  i am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  also thank you for the gold and silver kind internet strangers.

edit 2:  dear god.  i read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking i had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5k more posts.  i'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   i was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  i haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have i opened any of the 20 chat screens.  there are issues i want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  she was to use the barney gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  in other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  nope, neither of us drink.  we don't even have it in the house.
2. that i am upset she told her friend.  well this is an odd thing, before i posted this honestly i wasn't that upset about this part.  i was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  however now reading a lot of the post i have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  i would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. that i am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  well i'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  but the last part is just out of my control.  no matter what i do i will only ever be 7"" long.  we have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  she said that i was already great with everything but the one thing i can't control. (okay, so i gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. no i'm not going to do anything rash.  it's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  but yes i have to decide what i am going to do here before long.  it's not fair to either of us is i am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. she is sorry that i heard it.  she said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if i didn't catch her saying it.  it is what it is.  but yes i do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since i first told her.  me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  i don't know how much of that i believe but right now i guess i don't know why she would lie.  it really has wrecked hell on our christmas spirit this year i know that. 

edit 3:  engineer for those who keep asking what i do for a living.  she is a paralegal.  
edit 4:  people have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how i know she was heartbroken.  we met about 9 months after they separated.  i know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  he just ended things so he could be with another woman.  she approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  on our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  it was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but i did it.  we sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time i never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates i tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because i didn't want to commit either.  after close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  obviously that was our first night together.  within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  so yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  i had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

edit 5:  okay i posted it below in the mass of other posts but i have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

"my wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary. tl;dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. brought flowers to wifes office. found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

yup. tl;dr  says it all. my (35m) wife (35f) and i were married ten years ago yesterday. she has been working on a big project for the last few months. the last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. this is a career maker for her.

 i work construction. with the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. so i work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. if its raining when i get up i dont go in. somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. i usually hit the gym for an hour or two. thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. we go home. i go to the gym as usual. i cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. we really havent seen much of each other this week. i went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. not unusual for past month. 

i stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. nichole was at the receptionist desk. i told her i got here later than i wanted could she put the flowers on mehgans desk. she said ""i dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" she buzzed the door to get back to the offices. the place was deserted. i went to her office, the door was closed . i always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. i walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. she is giggling only as she can. saying""we got to get this done"".  i am gut punched. i slammed the flowers down said ""happy anniversary"" and walked out. i didnt hear what she said just went past nichole said goodbye and left. made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

i balled my eyes out all the way home. went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. i drove about 2 hours to a state park. i had no idea what to do . i just had to run. i hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. i dont drink much so i had no booze, i just sat there thinking. looking back i am glad i was in a rush, normally i bring a 45cal. with me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. the way i was feeling i might have ate the barrel that night. my phone was blowing up fom mehgan so i had turned it off. i left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. i called him back. he said meghan called him to check on me, make sure i didnt do anything stupid. we talked a bit, told him i got to think this thru, would catch up on friday.

so while i am thinking about this, i go over our marriage from the beginning to see what i missed. we come from completely opposite backgrounds. my grandfather raised me with my mom. he taught me about life. he had a little saying about everyhing. he told me marriage would be the hardest job zi ever had, you had to work on it everyday. god i miss him. we did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. they worked hard and my brother and i did not miss out on anything we knew of.

mehgan was born into money. not overly rich but very comfortable. went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. and she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. i would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  we met hit off started dating. i was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. we dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. her dad and i started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

she graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. we work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. i took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. we agreed we had to experience the others interests. she was really enthused about the more physical things we did. i kinda like the symphony and such. i own two tuxes now.

i look back and do not see any red flags. her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. she was paraded out in front for photo ops. invited to conferences when other newbies were not. at dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. she quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . this 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. she seems very happy. we seemed very happy. 

so now, friday, i am home. i called her. asked where she was, back at work. i being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. she responded since i would not talk what was she to do? fair enough. she will be home in an hour. so i wait. i want to save our marriage. if i am lacking in providing then i want to fix it. i want to ask why of course but i can not accept  a idk answer. how do i phrase this? what else should i be asking? i know i will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  what she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. thank you in advance.",8
"update i've been putting off introducing my 28m girlfriend 26f to my parents 60sm/f because they'll be weird about her weight. op(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

went like this. paraphrasing of course. 


me: hey mom and dad, you know i mentioned a girlfriend a few times. we're moving in together so i'm thinking i'll bring her out. 


mom: oh that's nice. first week of december maybe? 


me: sure. look there's one thing though. she's not thin. if you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. i love her. and she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so i expect you to show her the same respect. 


mom: but you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


me: no. this is exactly what i'm talking about. 


mom: fine. i'm just happy i finally get to meet her. 


dad: *insulting weight related comment*


me: what the fuck dad? 


mom: oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


me: no if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, i'll just not come. i have zero tolerance for this. you're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


dad: *insulting joke* 



me: ok, bye. if you wonder why brother is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



mom: no, wait, i'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


dad: *insulting comment* 



me: i'm hanging up. 


so it looks like i'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. probably not soon. my girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and i started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""it would be nice if i could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

so thanks for the comments and help. for now it's a non issue it turns out. 


*tl;dr: my dad couldn't even hold it together through a phone call so my mom will meet my girlfriend some other time, my dad is affectively disinvited in the event we get married, and we're just going to let this go for now.*",8
"engagement ring/breakup fund. update thank you all!! i appreciate the traction this silly post gained. your responses have more that assured me that i've got something here. i got back from my parent's 25th anniversary party my sisters and i put on today and the post blew up. i hope to some day be half as close with someone as my parents! 

i did my best to get through all the comments and reply/upvote where appropriate. have an amazing day everyone!

whenever i start a new relationship i start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. i'm a big romantic so i intend on using this money, in the event this girl is ""the one"", towards an engagement ring far down the road. subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, i cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. is this idea brilliant or am i putting too much attention on these extremes?",8
"i m 32 ruined christmas and i have no regrets.. is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years i was the one who blew up for the first time. 

long story short, i'm half-korean/half-white. my mom is korean. my dad side is white. so we only have my dad's side here in the us. for years, i watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. they never invite her to things. me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. to be frank, i don't care how i'm treated. every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. we repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. my mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. my white grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

three times today i watched a family member (aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should i sit?"". i watched my mom quietly recoil and i couldn't stand to see it again. this aunt does it the most and i finally blew up. i yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. i told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. to stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the us for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. i watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

my aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. as she was leaving i walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. i said  ""for 30 years i watched my mom give you a gift every year. i watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. i've never seen you treat her with the same"".  she didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

before i left, i apologized to everyone and explained why i was upset. everyone was shocked how mad i got. i felt like everyone understood why i was mad.  prior to this (around thanksgiving) i spoke to some family members about how i was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. which they have been trying to do more. 

after blowing up, it made things awkward. people trickled out early too. now my grandma is talking about not doing christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. i feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. does anyone have any advice on this? handling rude family?  should i do something else? 


edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below

mom's reaction: on the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. she's always taken the high road it's a very korean christian mom approach. my mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older immigrant/korean/boomer approach too. it's taught me a valuable skill in life. i don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being korean/white. after we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. she didn't say anything and asked me if i wanted my favorite korean dish. 

where is my dad: he was in the other room. yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. he's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. we'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. we would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. my dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. as soon as i got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (i can't describe it). there wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. i was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. my white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. for years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

me: reflecting on this as a whole. i can't believe the response. it shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. after thanksgiving i started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. i have no relationship with this aunt. i should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. a small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. if she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""f*ck her"".  please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. i should have tried to speak and i did what i felt was right, i don't regret it.. grandma's 80th bday is in two months.  i can't wait for that to be awkward. someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. cheers and have a happy new years!

update 12/29/18
i wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how i felt and i didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. i explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. i told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. i told her i wished i had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. i told her i want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. i'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

i called my grandma to let her know i sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. i told her i didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. my grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. i was right for standing up for my mom. also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""i never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
tldr: after 32 years i finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something i've been feeling for years. how do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. should i do something for blowing up?

"update: my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. edit:  here is the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azwevy/my_wife_30f_suffers_from_extreme_germophobia_and/), for those that havent seen it

&#x200b;

its been awhile since my original post, but i didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

since then, not much has improved. i decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. to my surprise, she agreed and i was so happy.

unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  i had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

this was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.  i feel so broken right now.  i'm going to see a counselor in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

i dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but i pray that she takes advantage of it because i still love her and i did this because i still do.

i told myself i would stop enabling her, mainly because i just cannot sustain this life. i am physically and mentally exhausted.  my kids are my top priority but i cant take care of them if i dont first take care of myself.

i thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. she was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and i hope that it will help her.

thanks for reading.",8
"update: i19m recently found out that my older sister34f is actually my biological mother.. link to original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m\_recently\_found\_out\_that\_my\_older\_sister34f/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m_recently_found_out_that_my_older_sister34f/) 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

ok so i first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200b;

so after a week of avoiding i came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. she was happy to see me and i told her to sit down because we need to talk.

i started things with saying that i know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. her face turned red and she started crying like hell. she knew what i was talking about. i told her the story about the dna test, about jennet and basically what i told you guys in the last post.

well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. she told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. he didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

she told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. when the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. after a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. as they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. she tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when i started crying. she started crying too. the couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. we were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. it took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(they came to their senses after a day or so). she reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. she made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

a few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. after so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. he met me a few times and i knew him as one of rose's old friends from the park. he helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. ironically i'm glad i got to know him before he passed, even if i didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200b;

btw, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200b;

so after hearing this i told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and i told her i understand she did the right thing. i pulled out an ""it's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and i headed off to my parents(adoptive) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200b;

i'm glad she is my mother. i feel for the first time in years - complete. i don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and i honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. thanks reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!",8
"update my ex girlfriend committed suicide.. i am a firefighter and had to find her body. its been a bit over 6 months since i posted that story and i want to give you a quick update on my life. im on mobile so i apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 tl;dr my ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. she was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. i am a firefighter in nj, but go to school in nh. i received the call and conducted research to find her. i drove back down to help with the search. we found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. i was in a dark place for a while after that. i drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. for a good amount of time i distanced myself from any girl who i met.

the funeral wasnt long after and jim didnt even show up. im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


i didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. it felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. the depression i felt was destructive.

my chief reached out to me not long after because i never told him how i knew her. he asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. i was in nh so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

i lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. i had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

after 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. i met this really nice girl named sarah. we talked  and even hooked up a couple times. after a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. i told her i couldnt. i told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. she took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. i felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. i didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

fast forward another month my friend kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. i accepted and thats when i met kristen. kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. we ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. i opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. she completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

she convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. so i made an appointment and went. the therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. i joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

i did my first story and kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. it was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. i continued doing these events and kristen went to every single one. 

after 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. she understood. weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

every time im in nj i go to lydias house and support her mom. on christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

the way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. and if it wasnt for kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.",8
"i (21f) found a hidden camera in my house. i suspect my sil (26f) put it there to watch me while i babysit my nephew (1m). what do i do?. i babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm mon-fri for free because a) i love my brother and nephew and b) i'm already a sahm for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, i have everything he needs already at home and i love kids. 

the spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. there is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv i found a weird circular object with a lens in it. after some googling i found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. i flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. he vehemently denied it and suggested i called the police and explain to them that i need a bug check. the only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my sil; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and bro and our parents only come on the weekends. i suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. another reason i suspect sil is because i had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" it could be a coincidence, but now that i found the camera i'm not so sure.


if it's her, she knows i know since i'm assuming she saw me find it. what do i do? do i confront her and ask if its hers? i couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; i have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. i would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care i take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course i treat my nephew the same.",8
"update overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

so i read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, i was doubting if i made the right decesion. i wasn't going to update because i didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days i came to a final conclusion.i want to clarify that i broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

after i broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. she would send me letters and call me a lot. in one of the texts i actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. i was about to agree, but something she said made me realize i would be making a mistake if i did. she said, ""i'll remember to respect from now on."" that sentence made me realize that i made the right choice by breaking up. since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

either way i'm glad i didn't give her a second chance. i don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

on a sidenote, the other day i was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and i guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that i moved on to fast. blocked her and had a laugh i know for a fact i made the right choice.",8
"this morning i (27m) found out my gf (27f) cheated on me, where to go from here?. so our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but i asked my boss if i could come in late as i had some stuff i had to do. however i went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. she gave me a key to her apartment and when i went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




as soon as i walked in she saw me and burst into tears. the guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. i freaked out at first and the guy left. she kept asking what are you doing here, i thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. i tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



i took the flowers and the gift and left. i'm sitting at work right now because if i went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





we've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. i was looking up rings. she said it's because i was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. she thought i wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. i asked if there were any others but she said no. idk what to believe at this point. 




the kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. we had lunch and got a hotel room together. we had dinner at my place with my folks and i dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. i trusted her for fucks sake.




 how and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? what am i supposed to do from here?



tl;dr spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30pm. : i broke up with her, i told her i'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. i'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

"serious my (35m) girlfriend (24f) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and i'm not into it at all.. so, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. an additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like 'f*** me with that horse cock'. i've never thought much of it, i thought that was just a way of her saying it's big. but she's started to take it further and it's turned into a bit of a fetish that i'm not entirely comfortable with. a few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first i was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. i laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. i said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said i'd do it the following day. honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. i told her no, and i didn't want to do it again and she's back to being mad at me. am i being a dick here? i don't know what to do. sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion",8
"me (m34) and fiancee (f27), i am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship.. alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as i'm doing it. as it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. i'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (i only found  out because one of her friend's bf contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). i confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. i'll be totally honest in saying that i'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. i manned up, moved on and proposed (which i had planned on doing anyway). this is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200b;

fast forward to recent time. we are due married in november (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. distant, not herself, away with the fairies. even stopped having sex, which was very strange. i put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. forward to christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. i confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. i was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200b;

however, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. i arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. the vibe was bad guys, i could tell. we sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. at this rate i was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. basically, a few of her friends had back in october (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. i'll be honest, the idea made me ill. i said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........i got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. i wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. we got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. i basically said that i needed some headspace, and that i'd spend the weekend at my mates. it was quick after that, and i left without a fuss. i'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. i am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. i suppose if anyone has been in a similar place i could do with some advice 

&#x200b;

tldr; me (34m) and fiancee (27f), she asked for open relationship and i am fuming. ",8
"my son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family. i'm going to preface this by saying i love all three of my sons equally. they are 29, 24 and 22. it is my unequivocal truth.

it's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

after years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and i have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. we let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

i disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but i have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

after losing literally everything after my divorce, i have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. all three of our sons work in the business.

a week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. i was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. my oldest son managed to see it.

our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. my oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

i feel like i have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. my ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

if she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

the plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

my son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. he stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and i. our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

i am devastated. i have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him i want the will to be changed to split everything equally. but the damage is done.

he's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). his brothers and my wife and i are so hurt hearing this. it couldn't be any further than the truth. it's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

he has refused to come in to work since the past week and i've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

i don't know how to fix this. he won't take my calls.

my ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on facebook that i am considering legal action over. but i know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

i'm not sure how to salvage this. and i am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. my younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. it's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. my wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

tl;dr my oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. but now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after i have tried to fix it.",8
"i(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when i was told to look after the family pet.. my siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and i've been of to uni. 

i am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. i've been trying to act like i didn't care but when they were driving to the airport i couldn't stop crying. my mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. last time we went to a family vacation was when i was around 13. i cried so much i had cramps in my abdomen.

i wrote them a message trying to make them understand what i was feeling and that it hurt me alot. i got back that i was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. they said they thought i wanted to be ""free"". i know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions i've tried to hide come through. i've never felt this left out and i feel like i'm not a family member. i'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on holliday.
i feel heartbroken.

my plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to uni and dive into school to forget.

how can i forgive them? has this happened to anyone else?

edit: 



i would have paid for myself. this is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. they brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. they are all there. the whole family. they brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. i would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

i am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. i've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that i need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

i'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and i send all the hugs in the world to you! the feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




edit 30 juli: 

i just wanted to say that i've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" i believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. my mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that i wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

for anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. being away from family is hard and i missed mine alot. being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",8
"i (24 f) just found out my husband (34 m) is paying for an apartment that i know nothing about.. we have owned our house for the four years we've been married. he's had this apartment for two years. i only found out about it because the landlord couldn't reach him on his cell and called the landline 

he refuses to talk to me about it and says since he makes the money he doesn't need my input on all decisions.

i'm tempted to call that landlord and get the address and see where this place is and get let in to see it.

i've gone to this place before. the people who work there are rough and not nice but after a year there when i was 17 i did okay up until now.

"update: i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. &#x200b;

link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

i've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. i've also read through a lot of the comments. thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. there's been a lot of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. it's whatever at this point.

we had been texting off and on all evening. as promised, i agreed not to bring it up in person. when i got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. i was a little nervous not knowing what i might be walking into, but overall i just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. when i walked in it was clear so did she. her sister was helping her pack up her things. i didn't know what to say, but i never expected this. i honestly thought everything was going to be okay when i got home. her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

i walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. she didn't say anything either. she didn't even look at me. if she was going to leave i at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. everything i had read in the comments about buying a bidet and ocd lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than i had considered. i started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""you put this online? i told you to not talk about it!"" her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. she then accused me of cheating. what? this whole thing has been crazy and i feel like i had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. i snapped.

i told her sister i had never cheated. not once. i would never cheat on her. enough was enough, so i told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier i had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. everything went silent. like, no one said a word. out of nowhere they both start crying. her sister stared yelling at me and told me i shouldn't be talking about things i don't understand. when i asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that i need to mind my own business.

1. her sister knows about it. (she did not know i posted on reddit about it)
2. her sister thinks it's normal.
3. i need to mind my own business? they're my socks!

i stood there all kinds of messed up so i just left. i went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. i also called off work today. i went home and all her stuff is gone. i didn't text her back. i think i'm done.

to clarify a few things: she insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. she told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. she reaffirmed it's not a fetish. she won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. i can't keep up with the comments. i'm pooped. (i'm trying to find humor in this because i'm really upset :(

so yeah.

edit: (a sentence) her sister did not previously know i posted about it on reddit. i'm sure they both do now. ",8
"my gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where i proposed.. i decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. i flew her to vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in cambodia. she had wanted to see angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. after a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together i proposed and she said yes. we kissed and i had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. it's really beautiful. she took a shower and i laid in bed thinking what an amazing day i just had and how i would get to spend the rest of my life with the women i loved. when she came out of the shower however she was in tears. she handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

i played it cool and said i understood but truthfully it hurt. it seems to me that i had offered her something of value. a lifelong commitment and partner. i took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. i felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. it was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. if she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. so she can't possibly value me or what i have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place i asked. 

i'm preparing to end things when we get back. she wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but i'm done. am i wrong? should i do it over? what do you think.

any advice is appreciated.",8
"my (f 20) mother (f 37) tells me if i don't be her surrogate she'll cut me out of her life forever.. my mother and her new husband want to have a baby. she's still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. so her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she's older. she told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. she said all i have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. i told her i can't do that. for one, i'm trying to get my nursing degree and i don't want anything to slow me down. and i already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there's no way i want to go through it again so soon. i'm also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it's still in the womb. i don't want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won't be mine. i gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me ""it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me"". she told me all she wants is another baby and that i shouldn't deprive her of it when i can help her so easily. i tried to reason with her but she literally told me ""if you don't do this to me then i don't want a relationship with you anymore"". i asked her if she was serious and she told me ""yes"" and left. i don't know what to do. my mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. i'm not sure how i should handle this. i think she's acting crazy.",8
"my (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me. i can't stop thinking of it. i've been in the bath for a long time because i've been dreading going to bed with him. 

a few hours ago i was lying in bed feeding our baby. my husband was begging me to come do something with him. i tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  he kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

i just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

i could see he was starting to lose his patience and i told him ""honey i have to take care of him before you, you know that"". and what he said back was really stunning. he looked me right in the eyes and said ""if you love him so much, why don't you suck his dick instead of mine"". i couldn't say anything, i didn't know what to say. and then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

i don't even know what to make of this. what should i do? it just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive. i really don't have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. am i just being sensitive? maybe i'm just emotional, but i feel like crying.",8
"my (36m) wife (33f) was sued, i'm feeling resentment towards her and i don't know how to move past it.. fwiw this is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. no offense to reddit, but i'd rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but i'm okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

as the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. the money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

my currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger i'm feeling towards my wife. until now i've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. but, since i'm the breadwinner i can't help but to feel like i'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. i've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. however, i have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where i know my wife is guilty. she has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

what did my wife do? (note: i had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

she used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. my wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but laura gave her a personal email address instead. my wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as laura at her company. these messages said derogatory things about laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make laura look bad. her manager got one of these messages that claimed that laura was a heavy drug user. laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass laura. well, laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. not only that, but laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. my wife didn't know this at this point, but laura was pregnant. several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on laura behalf. 


using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. she did some more internet sleuthing and found laura's husband on facebook. laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. my wife sent him an email claiming that laura was cheating on him. the husband confronted laura about this email and laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  my wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. what she didn't realize was laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. she also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


my wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. one of laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. my wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) she did not make herself known immediately. instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. she was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about laura - my wife was telling people that laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. this was at an event where her husband was at as well. the word got back around to laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


i'm leaving a fair amount of information out - my wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in laura circle and sent them messages about laura on multiple occasions. all the messages were trying to paint laura in an extremely derogatory light. all the events i've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  my wife didn't think to mask her ip address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same ip address, ours. many of laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. they had ample evidence against her. all the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. she even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


i honestly felt awful for laura, there were lots of tears on her end. you could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. she said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. she was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. and that my wife's harassment continued even after laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


my wife has never done anything this crazy before. i knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. we've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. but, she really fucked up this time. i don't know how to move forward. i know someone is going to suggest therapy, but i really want to start building up an emergency fund again. we're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** wife was sued by her former best friend, i emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. i need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. what can we do to move forward?",8

"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) found an engagement ring i was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. she thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.. i've been dating my girlfriend laura for just over two years. we met as i was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. we have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and i love her a great deal. she's definitely been the healthiest relationship i've ever had and i see a strong future with her. 

this weekend has been awful, however. my best friend rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend grace of about seven years. the problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. i offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. i hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last monday when he asked for it back. he (successfully!) proposed to grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

literally five minutes after she posted, laura rang me absolutely fuming. she told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had i given it to rob for grace when i'd clearly chosen it especially for her? was grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? i tried to talk her down and explain that i'd just been keeping it safe for rob and that i'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that i'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. she hung up on me, then texted me that i had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

am i wrong for thinking this is a red flag? i know that she probably was really excited and i absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. we don't live together and i don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. more than that, i am 100% not ready for marriage. we've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. i want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

what do i do? i totally understand why she'd be upset but i just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that i'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. this is the first big fight we've had and i'm not sure if i'm just seeing red flags because i'm hurt, or if they're really there.

"the way i (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. how do i tell people when they ask. so i met my boyfriend a year ago. i posted on my cities subreddit that i was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

i got about 50 messages all together. one guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. i love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. i gave him my number and we texted all night. our first phone call was over an hour.

he told me he was also lonely. i mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. he offered to cuddle me. we decided to have a cuddle date

we met up the following week. he picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. we got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

that's how we met. i know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. people have asked how we met and i've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  i don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?",8
"my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. nsfw. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

so, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, sarah 31f, my long-time partner, john 34m, and myself 29f.

i've known that sarah has had a crush on john for a long time. it's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, sarah has never crossed any boundaries. but because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(my boyfriend and i had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while i'm sleeping. she took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. she apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

i found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad i'm being abused.

but here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. he took the photos and videos *for me*. the day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so i can watch them because it's better than porn. 

but nobody believes me. they're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. i don't know what to do. i'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

how do i fix my friendships and convince everybody that **i'm** the one who wanted it? 

there is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but i do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. i'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

please help. i'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

edit: since this needs to be said, yes, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. it's a four digit code.

edit edit: 

- yes, i *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- i have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. just *mostly* everybody. i was upset and generalizing last night.

- i am in the us.

- my boyfriend **does have a passcode** on his phone. seriously. stop blaming him. this is *definitely* not his fault.

edit again since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and i: we attended a bbq where everybody left their phones inside. we *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

you guys are being a little mean about this.

**edit** (again): 

went to the police and will update when i can.

## minor update 

i went to the police last night, alone. after everything that was said, i was nervous about having john with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

really. y'all made me nervous.

i went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

at first, the officer at the window was like, ""i think that's a crime? maybe? i've gotta call my supervisor.""

that happened twice before the police were like, okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. we're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

i gave my report and left. about fifteen minutes later, i got a phone call from the local pd. they told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

my comments being that sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue john and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

they suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, i'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

so, that's about it. 

a bunch of hemming and hawing and i don't knows. they'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

i'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",8
"i (26f) am an escort and i am falling in love with one of my clients (39m). if you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me i am being exploited please don't i am not here for that.

&#x200b;

i took on this client about a year ago. i was immediately struck with how handsome he was. as i got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. he is always gentle i never had to enforce any boundaries with him. over the last year i have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. if there's a scheduling conflict i will give him the priority, lately i have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things i dont do with my other clients. i love my overnights with him. we have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. i feel very safe with him.

&#x200b;

i am falling in love with him. its never happened to me before. i have always kept emotion separate from my work but i cant help it with him. i will spend time with him i dont bill him for, i spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. i've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates i guess for lack of better word that i'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  i dont know what to do. i think i want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but i cant imagine he would be ok with my work if i was his gf. i am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, i think i would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200b;

i dont know what to do. do i go for it? risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? do i give up my career for him if he says yes? i dont think i could continue this if i was with him personally. do i just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? or do i drop him as a client altogether? i was never looking for a guy to ""save me"" but i cant help what i'm feeling for him.

&#x200b;

\*edit\*i know why hes single. his wife died in an accident 3 years ago.

edit2 i cant believe how many responses this post has gotten. i am going for it. i'll tell him this week. now to figure out how. lots had asked if i have a back up i do.

edit 3 i'm about to leave for lunch with him. i'm not going to bring it up yet but i do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. thanks for all the support. i didn't expect to see this much support.

edit 4 lunch was nice. we had a good time. i did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. then he asked me if i ever saw myself getting married and i had a similar answer, i told him i asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. he said he's like that. i'm going for it.

final update 

well i truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. i didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. i really didn't expect all the support i got. i was flooded with comments, pms and chat requests. some were about what i expected. accusations of gold digger, and ""cant turn a hoe into a housewife"" type comments thats really the response i expected. what i didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. you were all right in that i did know what i really wanted. i did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push i needed to not waste anymore time. shoot your shot right?

&#x200b;

i'd like to address a few things before i get into the update

&#x200b;

a few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. i was pretty sure he wasn't married i did out-calls to his home and my married clients never take me to their home always a hotel. but i was regularly in his home, i saw the pictures of her around the house i know she was real. 

&#x200b;

how can i trust a guy who uses escorts? well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what i do. i cant imagine judging a man for using my service. i was his first too and unless hes a good actor i know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. i never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business. 

&#x200b;

i should wait for him to approach me. unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. as the lines became blurred i did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous i had to drop. i am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. i had to be the one to make this move

&#x200b;

do i want to do this forever/do i really want to give it up? different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. some in favor some against. bottom line is i don't think i see myself doing this into my 30's. it used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets i look forward to anymore are the ones with him. i also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. i heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but i just cant. even if he would be ok with it i just cant. another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what i do. shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200b;

a lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our ""working"" relationship. i imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so i'll put it here. we have been. for some time now. we meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. we also text throughout the week. 

&#x200b;

ok on to the update. i think i left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. this was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. i posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. he said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. then he followed up with a question about if i would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. and i sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. he had to go back to work by this point and i invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. he has never been to my home. i dont bring clients back there only friends. i hoped that sent a strong signal to him. 

&#x200b;

i went back home and started getting ready, i had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. i called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more ""normal"" i told her about the reddit post and said i was making the jump. i also let her know i wanted to take her up on her offer. i called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. i said something had come up and i wouldn't be available. i'm out. i'm done regardless of what happened with him if i cant get my head in the game anymore and i'm getting too personal, plus now i am realizing i want to be in a relationship and i cant separate sex from my feelings like i thought, its time to call it. this isn't what i want anymore. this choice was for me not him. even if things didn't work out with him i realized i really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. one thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when i told him. i honestly didn't believe he would but i asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. she knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200b;

i got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. he came by at around 7. he had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. i invited him. he said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. i told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. i dont bring clients to my home. i was really hoping he was getting the hint. dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but i could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. so i put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and ""shoot my shot"" as you all put it. i told him i was dropping him as a client. he looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? what did he do wrong? did something happen. i assured him it want about him. i was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. i told him about the job i took and he wished me good luck, he said i was attractive and charming and he was sure i would do well in sales. he said he was going to miss me. i took a big deep breath and said. ""you dont have to miss me if you dont want to"" and then i spilled it. he was the only client i brought home to tell in person. i laid it all out all the things i mentioned in the post. how i felt about him and how i didnt want to be his escort anymore. i wanted to be his girlfriend. i said i understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now i was asking to stick around and i would understand if he didnt want to continue on. he said who told you that? that he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. he said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. he was still hurt over his wife and that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. he asked me if i was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. i told him i could work with it and that i wasn't trying to replace her. we kissed. i led him into my bedroom and we made love. 

&#x200b;

we spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. he offered to help me make the transition but i told him i wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. i appreciated his offer and if i needed the help i would ask but i need to do try on my own at first. he respected that. i told him that things would change now. as his gf i would have expectations of him i never had as an escort. he was ok with that. i told him i never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now i wanted monogamy i would give it and i wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and i reminded him i dropped my clients. he said that wasn't a problem. i was the only one. he spent the night with me and left this morning.

 

&#x200b;

where is this going to lead us next? i have no idea. maybe i am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was god working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. i'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. my whole life has drastically changed in just a day. i didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it. 

&#x200b;

to everyone who said i was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but i have to find out, to everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it i would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer. 

&#x200b;

as a final thought i want to say that this isn't normal. if you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. while i'm sure it happens and ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. if you're considering sex work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. oh and i hated pretty woman btw. i never thought it would be me one day. 

&#x200b;

you can pm nice comments to me if you have something supportive to say. if you just want to spite bile save it.",8
"update: mym25 girlfriend24 of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommatem25. i just heard them through the wall.. it's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships. i don't know if this one will be allowed but i figured i'd give an update to my situation.

> as the title says, we broke up. it was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. we broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so i can see why it happened.
> 
> this isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any pda while i'm around. i still both consider them friends and i just want them to be happy.
> 
> for the most part, they are quiet at night. if i really listen i can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. except for last night. we went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. i was the dd because i don't really drink. anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. i made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. i then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. as i was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. she thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when i was ready. when i finally got to bed i could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. then it got quiet and then it started.
> 
> i don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. i've been okay with the break up until now, i'm glad they're happy but last night i fell asleep crying.

> i woke up this morning, made breakfast for everyone and started to clean up.
> 
> feel free to ignore this, i just needed to get this off my chest. i'm sad when i really think about the situation, but that's why i try not to.
> 
> tl;dr: my ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

taking everyone's advice i announced that i was going to be moving out. my now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. i told him yes, but i'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. he decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. it's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. my landlord is xrms(ex-roommate) family friend, after xrm explained the situation i ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

xrm and xgf and a few other friends helped me move in. i had a house warming party and was specifically asked that i not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. xrm and xgf also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. my xgf stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. she said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. she told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. it was great. we've gone out a few times since our first date. 

the past few weeks have been the best in a long time, i never really realized how bad my situation was. obviously everything isn't perfect, and i still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but i'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

tl;dr: i moved out and started dating a new girl. ",8
"update: my 20 fiance's 27m behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship. i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as i felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. a lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

i spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who i am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. she expressed some concern and agreed that i should speak with fiance's brother. fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. that sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because i went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because i didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. i got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because i was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. i just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. i knew that something really needed to change.

the next day fiance left for work and i left for school just as usual. i called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and i basically told him that i had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that i was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if i wanted to speak with him. i was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. i hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. i was extremely nervous and felt like i was doing something sneaky and horrible, but i needed to know what was going on. i spoke with his manager and learned that he had quit his job weeks ago!! he told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. wtf! so i guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. after work i went home and fiance was gaming. i told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. he finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. i was literally shaking at this point and told him that i was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. i said that i was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. i said that i was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. at this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. so i did something stupid and stood in front of the tv and said that i knew about him quitting his job to game all day. he flipped out. he got violent and pushed me away from the tv. there was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). i got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. he eventually came and apologized. he offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. i literally felt sick. i locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. he literally just kept gaming until i went to sleep.

the next day i couldn't go to school because i had a bad black eye, it was not something i could explain away. i wanted to just disappear. i got on the bus and went to the women's center. my cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad i looked. i was very adament that i don't want to press charges or anything, i just needed help with the next steps of getting away. the social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. she helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while i drafted and sent fiance a text stating that i cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. he called me nearly 20 times during the time i was at the center. i didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. for the short term i am staying with my cousin and her husband and i'm working on finding an apartment. next month i'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. i still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like i'm living in a nightmare. but for the past week or so i haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. i've also gone to bed before 11 every night. someone on here sent me a pm saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so i'm just glad i was able to get away when i did. 

i don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and i just wanted to put this out here.",8
"(update) my roommate's (21f) parents keep letting themselves into my (21f) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

rm= roommate's mom   r=roommate

i came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and rm and r were in the kitchen making some coffee. she has never been there this early before. 

i decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. i atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (in brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points i listed:

1. i appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but i want to do that on my own. i love to cook and felt that i was never allowed in my own kitchen. i also told her that i want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. i don't want her in my room. i reminded her that i talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why i put the lock on the door.

3. i told her that if she wants to be with r, to let r text me and lmk that rm would be in the apartment. 

they expressed understanding and i hugged it out with rm. 

before going to class, i put a load of laundry. my friend is having a birthday dinner today, and i decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. i asked rm multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. i told her that i would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when i finish mine later this afternoon if needed (i didn't want her touching my clothes). she was okay with it and said r didn't have laundry today. cool. i left feeling really relieved, but i still locked my bedroom door. 

i got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and i couldn't find my white dress. as soon as i came home, r looked nervous. my clothes were in the dryer, and i didn't do that for a fact. rm states that i put them in the dryer and just forgot. ughhh. i locked myself in my room, and i know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

when i was in my room, i heard rm talking to r in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. in india, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" and she went on to tell r that i won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

i honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? i'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

i'm heading over to my parents right now and i'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. i'll keep you posted.

"update my 42m daughter 14f won't get an abortion. yesterday i posted https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because i didn't have ""throwra"". i've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**original** 

i \42m\ am a single father to my daughter \14f\. my wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. she's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. she doesn't see too much of me because i work 9-7, but i'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

around tuesday, i noticed there was something off about her. she was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch tv together. i figured it was just moody teenage hormones. except it doesn't stop. friday i finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. she looked at me and just burst into tears. she cried more, so i held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""i'm pregnant.""

i was shocked. utterly and completely shocked. i kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. i took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. i didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, i'd wait until she calmed down a little. saturday she came down for breakfast and i sat her down and asked her her plans. she said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. i then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. i calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? i go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. she suggested she start online school, which i refused, saying i don't want her to ruin her life.

the thing is, i don't even want to consider adoption. i can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. i don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if i lose her?i told her this, and she asked me if i had no love for my grandchild. but i don't. i don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, i care about her. the girl i raised. i told her today that she had to abort her child. she cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. there's no way i'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. and for school, i don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

at this point, i see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, i'm kicking her out. it hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, i'm afraid her life will truly be over. i won't actually, but i'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. i'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do i get out of this?

where do i go from here?

tl;dr: my daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**update**

so today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. it's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. they said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

after the doctor's i took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. i told her i had to know, she had to tell me. she refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. we went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so i took it and looked through her messages. according to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. she hadn't told him yet.   
i wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him i was \daughter's name\ dad, and i needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. i expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so i called his mom and i told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. she asked if i was sure, and i said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. i said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. she said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. i asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. she asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. she hung up before i could say anything else. 

now i don't know where i stand. i can't afford a lawyer, and i don't think i can make him get involved either way. i don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. is there a way they could get out of paying it? i don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

my daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but i'm going to stop peppering her with it now. my sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and i hope a female influence will work better on her than i am. she's sending a little bit of money, and i think i may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and i can do.

"i (36m) think my wife of 8 years (31f) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42m). throw away for obvious reasons.

so my wife and i have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  at first it's good and we start communicating better.  

about three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". alone.

around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

she starts telling her friends about ""danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which i think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""dr. soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""danny"".  (i don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and i were intimate.

there have been a couple of other weird coincidences that i thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  she went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  it was about 9;30 at night and that seemed really odd to me.

about a half hour later i tracked her iphone and the location showed up as his office.

when she came home 3 hours later, i asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

i think i'm going to confront them in the session this thursday.",8
"wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. i literally do not know what to do. this is long, **tl;dr** at bottom.

my wife and i have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  she's always been one of the most amazing people i've ever met. no huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. that's why this is so difficult for me.

we've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  she's in marketing and i work independently as an it consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  we decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  we've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

long story short, i was diagnosed with azoospermia last december.  blockage in the pipes just meant i wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. it's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this july.  she's got a high sex drive as do i, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way i could have gotten her pregnant.

she missed her period this week.  i couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  the babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  she took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

at first i was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. she's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. i'm not the jealous type, but i'm literally stuck.  the doctors said this couldn't happen.  and i can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

my wife's been ecstatic. she's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. she was so excited when she first found out that i didn't express my worries then.  but she left for work and now i feel completely torn.  what if she did cheat?

looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. she definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. she always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  i remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

fuck man i don't know what to do.  i set up an appointment on monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  if it is mine and i accuse her of cheating i feel like the world's biggest asshole. but she's coming home in a few hours and i don't know what i'm going to say to her, i can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and i just didn't see it.

do i wait until the doctor appointment monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? i'm worried i won't be able to hide what's going on.

**tl;dr:  wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july.  wife got pregnant anyways.  it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.  want to wait until monday, but don't think i can hide it.  what do i tell her?**

**edit:**  i should add i've been cheated on before.  our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  i'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**edit** i really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  my wife's coming home though in an hour and i have to decide if i'm going to put on a happy face until monday or not.

**edit** she texted saying she's going be home late

this is bringing up some old emotional scars i think and is just fucking with me.  i'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  i think i need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

"my 25m girlfriend29 suggested about having a ffm threesome. i was skeptical at first and politely turned it down but gave in when she kept on talking about how awesome it would be. now she is giving me a hard time because i accepted the idea and didn't deny strongly. am i being manipulated?. hello all,
a few days ago my25m girlfriend29 suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

knowing her, i disagreed at first. she kept on insisting and i gave into the idea. i cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
a few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. then when i finally reached her she was crying. she seemed broken. she told me that i didn't deny her strong enough. she told me that had i ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. she was mad and we broke up because i didn't deny her strongly.
basically, i feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
i feel that i am being manipulated. dear reddit, please help me out. thanks.

update (2 weeks after the post): first off, thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. the comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. thanks a lot.

we had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. so, i decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. no clue about her intentions though, but i am at a much better place. thank you reddit!",8
"update: she20f lost her virginity while we were taking a break. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f\_lost\_her\_virginity\_while\_we\_were\_taking\_a/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/?sort=new)

hey guys. first of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

so, long story short, 3 days ago i ""broke up"" with her for good.

now, you guys might not agree with the way i did it, but i did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. even though i am sad and disappointed, at the same time i understand she wanted to see other options and i respect she didn't outright cheat on me. that being said, i am also not a backup plan and i deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

i didn't see her anymore and i finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""hey \name\, first of all, i don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. i took some days to think about it and i realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and i would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. i understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. i respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. i wanted to thank you for all those years and i wanted to apologize for any wrongs i did to you. i want you to know that i am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. i hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. goodbye, op""

the message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but i realized i am already getting over it and that i no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. she replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. so, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, i am almost certain that i would accept her back. so yeah, until next time.",8
"my 45m wife 42f revealed she was unfaithful and i'm divorcing her. our children 15f & 17m hate me for it.. edit: guys, i appreciate the advice. but i'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. i've made my decision, and it's not something i'm willing to forgive. i'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

my wife and i have been together for 18 years. we had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. we've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

about two weeks ago i brought up an advice column in the paper i had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and i could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so i asked her what was bothering her. she confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. this was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. she says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. we talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. i realized i knew i'd never be able to let this go, nor would i be able to forgive her. she's distraught.

we sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. obviously this was extremely tough. they acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. my wife and i agreed to tell them it was mutual, but i guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. this had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. my wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. i don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so i'm being trying to explain as tactfully as i can, but they're gone as far as saying that when i get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that i still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. my wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since i've told her of my plan to leave.

i love my kids, but i don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. i don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that i'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. i just know that i cannot get past this, and for my own happiness i need to leave. any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

tl;dr wife revealed past infidelity. i'm leaving. kids hate me for it.",8
"update dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. am i wrong to be angry?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

you guys are right. i can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. i resent this man so much. i can't stand the sight of him. 

after i posted yesterday, i was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. to no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. i picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. i heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but i didn't bring up any of our hardships. my mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. i did, i forgave him but that doesn't mean i need to have a relationship with him anymore. again, my family protested that i'm being cruel and heartless. i'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. i told them i would not be present at any family events if he was there.

my sister shouted at me claiming ""he is our dad. you asshole"". yes he is, to which i replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. i told them i had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. my sisters need to return the iphone's that are on contract as i am cancelling those. driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that i pay for. these are dad's responsibilities now. ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

i have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. i need a break.

i'm done. i'm done taking over dad's role. i'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. i'm 25 and i need to live my own life now. i don't think this will burn bridges. it's just a wake up call for them.

edit: i'm not going to ghost or abandon them. they need to become independent now. 

edit:  i'm reading all the comments. i know i have acted like a jerk. i just need some time to collect my thoughts. i might update later.",8
"final update my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue.. original post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
update post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

so firstly thanks for all of your input. i read and considered every single reply. first i'll update you, then i'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. i want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, i'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and i feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

update: 

i spoke to her in person after i posted my update. from her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. she was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""i don't know, i'll probably tell him that i feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

i said great, all that is understandable. just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

she said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

i thanked her for telling me, and then i called off the wedding entirely. 

she cried, i cried, it was a goddamn mess. she asked where we go from here. i told her i don't know. i don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but i know that the engagement is over, and that **if** i decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. and now i have to decide if **i** want that. do i went to spend another 4 years being undecided? if i'm being honest with myself, i imagine it taking another couple of years before i can trust her again. do i want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? close to 40? 

i told her that i have a lot to think about. 

i spoke to her dad last night. we shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. my ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. she's been crying a lot. i do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

her dad caught wind of the situation on facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. he'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. she told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. he told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. he said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

so that's it. i still have a lot to think about. i know a lot of you guys are telling me that i have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that i still love her and have loved her for a few years now. right now, i'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

as for my reputation, nobody thinks i'm an abuser. it's firmly out there now. her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. i haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. there's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

my family agrees with a lot of you. they're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. just give me some time. i'm not going to make another update post, because i've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe i'll just update this post in a few days after i've decided what to do.",8

"my ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), i was starting to heal until i found out the reasons why he ghosted.. the past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. i'm not sure if i'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

my ex, 'tom', and i had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so i thought. we had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). i was happy, and i thought he was too. we had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, i could go on. 

everything was fine until our last trip together. we went to a destination where i had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something i'd have to wait longer to do. it was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

after we landed (the last time i saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. i didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. i tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. i started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. from there our communication basically broke down. i can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. from that point i'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. after about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then i wouldn't hear from him for several more days. what hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with new years, valentine's day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

i felt like i was going crazy. i had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  i was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. i stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. i found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse i could think of whenever i showed up somewhere without him. 

i eventually broke down, i contacted one of his good friends who i felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. i told her that tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and i have no idea what's going on. i told her i didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that i needed to know about. she looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and i that i was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. this was soul crushing to hear and i felt humiliated and worthless. i told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. she said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

throughout march and april i felt like i was starting to heal some. i felt broken, but i started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. i told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. then i found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

he had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. not sure how long, but a little less than a year. i'm also hurt because i know the person he cheated on me with. she's an absolute garbage person. and i'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. she has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. i've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the lgbt community and non-christians. she is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. she somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. i think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, i'm really not sure. i can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. i've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. her parents have paid for her car and i think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. she spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and i frequent and will interject herself into our outings. she has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew i wouldn't approve. then he started to get high and then have sex with her. he felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. his intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. this woman hated my guts, and kept pushing tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. he didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. so she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. he came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

i only found out about this, because the same friend i had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that i deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. there is no way in hell that i'd get back together with tom
2. i can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and i'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. i don't know if i could contain my urge to slap him, or if i would just break down and sob. i was doing well from moving on from him. i was starting to feel happy again. now, i think i'm back at square 1. i'm depressed and stressed out. 

is there anything i can do? i kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",8
"my (25 f) boyfriend (24 m) of 5 years just disclosed to me that he does not believe women should be allowed to vote.. update: hi everyone, i had no idea that this post would gain this much traction. i'm sorry that i haven't been responding, i posted late-ish last night and have been at work today so i haven't had a chance to read the majority of the comments that have poured in. i am still at work so i won't have time until later to read through everything.
i wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. it has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt i have been facing. he really had me questioning this entire situation and whether i was overreacting or not. i am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. i can update again afterwards.
thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


i don't want to cause any political debates. if it's necessary for context: obviously i believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

i'm so confused, i don't know what to think. i'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but i just feel that i need some advice.

in the time i have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so i thought. politics was never an issue between us at all. however he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are american) and that they should not be allowed to vote... he says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

i'm upset and i can't tell if i'm wrong to be upset about this because i know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now i just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. he has assured me that he still thinks that i should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

this is a person i have been with for almost 5 years. we've talked about marriage. i don't know what to think. in all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and i can't imagine my life without him in it. but this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

am i wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? as his girlfriend am i supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though i may (strongly) disagree? i can't tell if i'm overreacting to this or not. the whole situation has made me feel terrible and i'm so confused.",8
"my girlfriend of 3.5 years kisses ex at sisters wedding right before i'm about to propose. my girlfriend (24f) of the past 3.5 years told me that when she went to her sister's wedding without me over the weekend that she kissed her ex. 
we had a trip planned for this upcoming week to go to spain and i was going to ask her to marry me - she was well aware this was going to happen. she always told me there was nothing she wanted more. 
she tells me she was drunk and it ""just happened"". 
i'm so hurt right now. she's said how sorry she is many times, and i believe her, but i feel so betrayed. 
we've had a great relationship up to this point, i've loved every minute of it. to add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. 
this hurts me to my core to think that someone i wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. out of all the women i've ever dated she was the one i was least worried about this happening with. 
she tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, i just don't know if i can move on. 
we live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
i just don't know what to do. i still love her to pieces  but idk if i can get past this. 
do i still go on the trip with her? do i try and make this work? i'm certainly holding off on the proposal for now.

edit: singing out for a bit guys. need to take some time and think things through and let my emotions stabilize. get in the right mindset. we talked when i got home and drove home some additional points you guys pointed out. thank you all for your comments, it's nice to see another point of view.",8
"i f25 received a letter from my mother f49 yesterday in the mail. i've never cried harder.. so around a week ago i posted on reddit that i was having issues with my mother. my husband and i took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. we are now working on adopting them. she has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. so i decided to take a step back from her.

i've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. it broke my heart and i broke down in tears. probably the most i've cried in so long.

it was such a heartbreaking letter. she said that ""i was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". it was a full page of just insults. the one that really got to me was ""you've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". i broke down that line. throughout my life all i wanted was to make her proud.

i ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. i'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. i talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. he truly is my rock.

i truly can't believe my mother would do such a hurtful thing. it broke me down but now i have to pick myself up. i fully think this would be enough for me to cut her out of my life forever. does anyone have any advice? anyone ever cut a parent out forever?",8
"i(22m) recently discovered my dad (50m) choose me over my former stepmother and half-sister(17f) 6 years ago. don't know how to process this.. i was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. when i was sent to live with my dad, i was broken. i barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  i wasn't mad or angry. i was null of any kind of emotion. basically i was alive but wasn't living. i kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. i was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. i was more social with my dad but i kept it to a bare minimum.  i had noting left to say to anyone. it took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. that's how withdrawn i had become.

dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  when i experienced night- terrors, i would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  he drove me to all of my therapist appointments. he made sure i was eating properly. there were days, i would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. he literally went above and beyond for me. i hated the city that were living in. because  i had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

i was so passive, it was scary. my therapist had told my dad that i was stuck in the victim's cycle; i didn't know how to get out. because of this, i was bullied quite a bit. by the time i was 15, i had been to 3 different schools. it got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. i was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. noting would motivate me.

looking back, dad did spoil me but at the time i wasn't aware of it. i was so in my own body that i barley acknowledged my surroundings.   if i asked my dad for a new bed spread, i would get me new one plus new furniture. my phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. i was grateful and thanked him. i did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. again i was being polite. i didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. i barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

by the time i was 16, dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. i didn't question it. he had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. i didn't think it was any of my business so i didn't press the issue. a year later, dad had divorced my stepmother. one of dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in boston and he took it. we moved and i felt i was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. that year was probably the best year of my life. i was coming out of my shell. there was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. it was if i was like everyone else. i felt ""normal"". i became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, i was going out more. us moving probably saved my life.

because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. there was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. you could just sense it. it got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

me and dad have always been close. when i had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, i could see my dad crying in the crowd. i lived with my dad while i attended college ( i still do for the time being) . ever since i was child, i always wanted to be a doctor. well, i just finished my first year of medical school. honestly, i feel like a normal young adult in society. i have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom i've been with for 4 years. i'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

recently, i got fb message from my half-sister. she was apologizing a lot and i had no clue what she was talking about. turns out, the reason why dad and i moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what i was watching her change........... yes. she told her mom that i was watching her change.. at the time, i was traumatized of sex. heck i was terrified of any form of intimacy. the kid was envious of what dad was doing for me. she was so envious that she tried to move me out. well i guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and i'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. because we moved out, i think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. how can someone be so cruel? what did i ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. i didn't even respond. more importantly, dad never let this to get back to me. chances are if i had heard about this when i was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. it also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

this is a lot to take in and i have a new found of respect and love for my dad. he gave up this marriage for me so i could live a normal life.dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. i'm missing him a lot lately.

should i bring it up to him when he returns? also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? at the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and i almost want to help.

tl;dr: dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. dad kept it from me for 6 years. should i bring up with him?

edit: i wasn't expecting such a huge response. i just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. it will take some time but i will read all of them or as much as i can. as i was going through the comments, i found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. this a part of my life. i don't normally like to talk about about this . aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. the fact the people are saying that it's fake.... i don't what to say. it's not my place to try and convince anyone. believe  me, they're times i wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. when i wrote this, i wasn't thinking about syntax. it was more just getting this out. people questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. forgive me but i wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

as for how i became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; i did respond to it in the comments but i'll post it here too. 

""it was very unorthodox how i became valedictorian after attending a real hs for only a year. my overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because i was in online classes for my previous hears, i wasn't eligible at the time. i met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

i broke down in front of the coordinator and i told her the truth. being named valedictorian was something i always wanted. to be that would have been my first accomplishment that i would have achieved based on my own merit. yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. it wasn't trying to be valedictorian financial reasons. money wasn't a problem (dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. this would have helped me self-worth as well.

the girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and i told her the truth. she actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. it something i'll forever be grateful for. that's actually how me and her became friends."". not many people would do that and in hs. 

i'll be posting again. i just need a few days.",8
"update to my (22f) twin (22f) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23m) of 8 months.. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dckm1r/my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to_sleep_with/

so i've made a lot of changes in my family life since i posted this a couple weeks ago. i first told everything to my boyfriend. he was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. he also respected that i didn't want her to meet him. 

i decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. she immediately noticed like within ten minutes after i'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so i didn't beat around the bush, i said yes because i didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. she tried to guilt trip me about how i hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like i knew they would). she exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but i hadn't even gotten a chance to say i was worried she'd do this. she said it first so what does that say?

i told her i flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. she called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. i can't reason with her. she just never sees the problem with anything she's done. the way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

i blocked her number, i still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. but we live hours apart, so i figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

then, as for them, i also got a call from my mom soon after i blocked my sister who wanted to know what i was doing because she was upset. she'd already heard my sister's side which was just that i'd blocked her out of nowhere. so i tried to tell her my side. i did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like i said in the first post i'm not going to fall to petty revenge. i just want her to stop interfering in my life. so all i said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys i've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. my mom then wanted to know what i meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). she also got my dad on the call at this point. i told them the details didn't matter. she kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if i had been having premarital sex. it was really frustrating. 

i told them the point i'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. they began saying i should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. well i'm not exactly fighting. i'm simply not going to be in contact with her. to them it's the same thing. 

then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. i said i wasn't going to do that, that i'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. they said they'd come to me then. that brought up how they show up for random visits even when i've said i don't like it. i told them i didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again i wouldn't let them in or talk with them. so they flipped out, that was fun, i got to hear all how i'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

i ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. and blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

i don't know wtf i'm going to do about them. they did threaten to stop paying for my college if i cut them out of my life. i unblocked them to say i want to be in touch with them and do love them but i can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. i said if they stop doing that then i'm happy to have a relationship with them. they had a million reasons why i'm in the wrong. i couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. so i don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

my boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. he thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. he's really helped keep me as sane as i can be. 

overall i just feel really shitty. i wish any of them would ever listen to what i say. but if they won't then what can i do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. it just sucks it has to be so...final, i guess. i wouldn't mind a middle ground like planning a visit with them once in a while, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than i do. 

tl;dr: i'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",8
"my husband constantly bodyshames me.. i was around 5'1 and 100 lbs when we got married and six years later, i'm 5'1 and 125 lbs. he constantly comments on my body and my weight even though i've never asked for his opinion.  i know my body isn't perfect, but i'm working on accepting that. 

actual things he has said to me

1. (a day after i gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - *disgusted tone and expression* ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" by the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""it's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""your thighs are huge. when you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""it's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. it's very noticeable from behind. i'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""i'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. he even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? you keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. so maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""short and fat isn't a good combination""

and so on. on average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. i've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. it's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",8
"update: i think my (22m) girlfriend (20f) might be cheating on me with my roommate.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/aj79wj/i\_think\_my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_might\_be\_cheating/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aj79wj/i_think_my_22m_girlfriend_20f_might_be_cheating/)

tldr: my girlfriend was really close with my roommate, i suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

basically, after i kicked my gf out of our party, i assumed we would all lay low for a few days. i was wrong. the day after the party, my roommate (i decided to call him chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but i ignored him. less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing chet couldn't have been avoided, because while i was a good boyfriend, i study and sleep too much. ok. she then told me she would be willing to work through this if i was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. i didn't respond to the text.

that night i had a dinner with my parents i couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. i came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. i figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. wrong. i noticed later when chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into his room.

i haven't seen either of them, i think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. i don't even know how to feel. honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and i'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",8
"my (21f) bf (20) told me he would break up with me if i got breast augmentation surgery. so i have, what is known as, ""tuberous breasts"" where during puberty the breast tissue doesn't develop like it should. the breasts develop droopy & the areolas are large & not proportional to the size of my breast. my plastic surgeon has confirmed this is what it is & told me that if i wanted to correct it, surgery is the only option. the surgery would include releasing the constricted tissue & then an implant will be placed above the muscle.

i am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because i know they don't look normal. i just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

i mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn't want a girl with ""fake boobs"". he won't even listen to me when i tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

i 100% plan on going through with the surgery. i told my doctor up front that i did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in april, the day before mine & my bf's anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i'm doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.

"girlfriend (22f) mad about my (24m) answer to scenario, what do i do?. so girlfriend and i had just finished having sex. we were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, i was dozing off and then she randomly said ""your love for me is unconditional right?"" and i mean i say that all the time so i didn't think much of it and i said ""yes, i will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers"" and it was clearly a joke. she kisses me but then says "" so if i turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?"" .... i was confused because it was such a random question and i laughed and just said ""i don't know about that, i'd love you as a pet i guess""

she sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point i'm completely lost. i just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" i said ""i mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey i would still love you unconditionally and i would not treat you like 'a pet'"" .... i had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. i just said "" if you were a donkey how else was i supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? am i supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??"" she says ""i'm not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!"" ... i just stopped talking because i didn't want to say anything else wrong. 

i'm just confused. she was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. what did i say? i have no idea what exactly she was upset about. am i not looking into this deep enough? i'm genuinely confused as to what i did and how to fix it. i don't want to say something and make it worse.

"update my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue.. edit: previous post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)

okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. i'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

a friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. she had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. i don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do i even really know the full story yet. she is not really the prank playing type and i guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

it looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. after i started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. i guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

anyway, i texted her and i told her that i knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. she started blowing my phone up apologizing. she said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. she also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that i was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

i just didn't really respond to her. i left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. my family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. i'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

i don't really know where to go from here. i don't know if i should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

i'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. i'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as i'm awake with this jameson. 

tl;dr: this was actually just a stupid prank by my fiancee.",8
"my f28 mil won't take my kid's 4 anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously. **update at bottom of post.**

i'll try to keep this as short as possible. sorry for mobile formatting. i've never really seen eye-to-eye with my mil because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... i understand that children need discipline, but i prefer a gentler approach with my son. i've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists i let it go, so i've tried to. 

until now. my son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. she insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that i'm just babying him. i've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

she has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. i told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying i accused her of being an unfit grandmother. which i admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

now my husband wants me to apologise to her. he says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that i'm overreacting. i kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is of the essence because it happens so quickly. 

so, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

she's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a lot of peanuts, everywhere. i asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

i'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a mama's boy who thinks mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. he says he turned out just fine being raised by her and i worry too much. 

would it be awful if i insist she only see him if i'm present? am i completely unreasonable and overreacting? is there anything else i can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**edit/mini-update**: first of all, woah. i did not expect this to get so much attention. thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. in case you missed it: i've left for now, removed my son from the situation, and i'm now currently staying at my brother's house. at least for a few days until things cool off and i'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. in the mean time, i've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. my husband has been to the same appointments i have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

some people have accused me of being a helicopter mom, or trying to demonize my mil. and given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe i'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then i'm okay. i'm not even a sahm, we have an incredible nanny while i work ft, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. in the past, i've tried my best for my mil to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, i've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. but i'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

lastly, i just want to say my mil has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. she won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. so, i don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. she's very strong in her beliefs. i did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. my husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so i told him to find time or he won't be getting any time with my son until he does. if he's going to be so careless, i'll end up dealing with this legally. 

thanks again everyone. words can't express my gratitude. i will update with a new thread eventually.",8
"my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile. hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

i don't really know how to begin so i'm just gonna dive right in. we've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and i have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. this took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. his parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. to the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

the problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. he has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. he talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. cool, i thought. that all sounds beautiful. 

we didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. it was on a day i was working so i couldn't go with him and when i asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. i was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

i did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

it was definitely a shock but i reacted positively and told him it looked really good. it was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

it's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. i can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. bf is super proud of it and i honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

my only issue with it is during sex. 

it takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. it doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo really stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

not to mention this thing is like the mona fu*cken lisa. 

any position that we're facing each other in, i always end up making eye contact with it. and every time i do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. every time. ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, i doubt i would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of any six year old. 

it's honestly ruining our sex life. 

i haven't told my bf any of this because i feel like i can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (i know lasers exist but i doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where i'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried i'm not attracted to him anymore.

i am attracted to him. i'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

what can i do in this situation? the thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. but looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

should i talk to him? am i overreacting? is our sex life officially dead? 

thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- my boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and i can't stop making eye contact with it during sex. 


———————————————————

update: this has gotten a lot more attention than i anticipated. some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. i'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. currently debating whether i should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

otherwise i've received some really phenomenal advice on how i should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. i was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before i made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. so thank you so much. 

i'll make a new post to update how things go once i've talked to my bf about all this. if he doesn't see this post first i think i'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

"my wife is done with sex and im not ready to be celibate for the rest of my life... are we done?. since finishing having kids a few years ago, my (now 39yo) wife has not been interested in sex - for a long time she would go though the motions for my sake but grew to resent the ""chore"" more and more to the point where she would avoid me like the plague and we were fighting about it all the time. she swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

we have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. no matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

essentially...
- if i try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if i am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

recently ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but im dying inside.

is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? i dont want an affair etc, i want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

"boyfriend (21m) kisses me when i'm asleep lol should i tell him i know?. so i've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and i found this out pretty early on. he does cute stuff when he thinks i'm asleep. i'm a deep sleeper so i never woke up from it. i couldn't asleep one night and i knew he was walking past me and he blew me a kiss and just said ""love ya bitch"" while he was walking lol. i didn't know what to say because we hadn't said i love you or anything at that point so i just continued to pretend to be asleep. he actually does it all the time!! sometimes he'll give me a kiss on my cheek or arm, or he'll say ""love you babe"". he is so sweet when i'm asleep!! he's not really affectionate like that when i'm awake, he kisses me but he doesn't randomly call me cute or something. and when i'm asleep, he can say ""did you know you're so cute"" like what!!!!???? sometimes i pretend to be asleep because i like hearing it. and he'll tell his friends that he's not a pussy and he's so tough and everything and i'm like 🙄🙄 you literally come to me when i'm sleeping and tell me good night in this sweet voice. i never say anything though 

when he's sitting down doing something random, i just have the strongest urge to go up to him and give him a kiss and be like ""you're cute babe"" and maybe he'll realize that i know. or should i just continue pretending i have no idea???",8
"i (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. idk what to do anymore.. i'm posting because i cannot share this with my family and i can't talk to my friends either.

wife and i have been married for 4 years, together for 12. last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. my brother was my hero. he was there for me when my parents abandoned us. he was there for me when i struggled with depression. he's like a father figure to me. 

so my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. he told me that it was very important. we met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. he told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. and he also started suspecting it. i was really shocked by this revelation. because my wife never told me about this. and i never imagined she would cheat on me.

but when i confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. she didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. but my brother claims it was consensual. 

we ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. i just want to kill myself. my brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

i'm really torn. i don't think my brother is a rapist. but i'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. also, she never told me this. she had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. idk what to do now. i think i'm just leaving. but i want some advice to cope up.",8
"divorce on table because husband and i cant agree on baby's name. hello reddit. this title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23f) and my husband (24m). 
we've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. i got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. in the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. he really loved her and he never hid that from me but i thought it was over once she moved away. now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and i can name the second child. when i asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. he doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name our child like that.

&#x200b;

i don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

i received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. i was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. his mood has been pretty touch and go lately so i was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and i thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

i basically said i know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because i haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. i absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. i stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? you want me to get rid of him?""

i ***explicitly*** said ""no i would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. this is where shit started to hit the fan. he said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that i was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if i was fucking sick in the head.

i fucked up here. i shouldn't have said this but i don't handle confrontation well and i pretty much lost my cool at this point. i told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. he completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (i agree) and started calling me a number of names. he then started to get extremely personal saying i never cared about his little brother and that i'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

that is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. i still cant bellieve it and i don't think i'm ever going to forgive hm for that. like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. he knows exactly how i feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? he can seriously go fuck himself because i'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

he then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes i know i'm basically killing his brother all over again??? i was crying so much at this point i didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. i have no idea where he's gone or where he is and i honestly don't even know if i care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

i still can't believe he reacted the way he did. he was like a completely different person. not once in the four years i've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. i was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as i was.

then this fucking morning i get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for forcing him to remove the tattoo. apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them i've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

what the fuck?!?! i explicitly told him i would never ask him to do that. when i told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. feckin lovely.

i seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. i'm still in total shock and just so confused. i hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. i don't see what i could have done differently? i shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

i'm just at a complete loss right now. a day ago i thought of this guy as my future husband and now i just don't know. i wish i never said anything.

i've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him i've never seen before. im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. how the fuk would we even move froward from this? am i the one in the wrong here for the comment i made? i know i shouldn't have said it but i personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am i supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? anything i sy is just going to sound like i'm lying in response to their negative reactions. i seriously have no idea what im supposed to do here. i feel like this is going to ruin my life.

i just don't fucking know.

"update: 41m questioning sexuality after making a new friend. going forward i will be posting updates via my profile. if you'd like to follow me, i invite you. i will post updates as i have them until i have nothing left to update as well as answer questions!  


update #2 following monday's notre dame game:

leading up to monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download snapchat, which i had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. i bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. he has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

anyway, so monday rolls around, i'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. i knew he'd have other friends there, all of which i'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. i get over there around 2. he has one friend already there and is expecting more. they trickle in and i'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. we cut up after the game, played some pool, james had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. i was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so i could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what i did. i did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. after some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

i asked james if we could talk outside. we walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""i know i kissed you the other day, and i don't know if that was something i should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. i've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and i think i may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" i was absolutely out there now. no turning back, i basically just told him i had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. he didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why i haven't brought it up before now. obviously i told him i had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the kiss! he reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. i could come to him with whatever was on my mind and i just teared up. it wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. i gave him a hug and told him i appreciated that, we sat down and i explained to him how confused i've been these last couple weeks. how this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. i sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. he is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things i said, they were all comforting. he told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. he is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. a few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.i don't know what i would call the gut feeling i had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out with him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  i felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. i have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. he explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but i shouldn't be pressured. i wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. i turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. full on made out for what seemed like ever. it was the most satisfying kiss i've ever had. this where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) i'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

by this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and i had to go. he walked me to my car and we made out a second time before i got in. he told me to get home safe and i did. i texted him to let him know i got home safe and hopped in the shower. i was so emotionally charged that i couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am. i ended up calling out of work tuesday. james and i have plans to hangout again this weekend. he wants to go out for food and a place called topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, i've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. i'm really looking forward to it and i'm just taking things day to day at this point. i know where we stand and i'm happy.

thank you for all of your support. i have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. i just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. you only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. i am learning this myself and i'm telling you, it's liberating.

i'll post any other updates here, above this one.  if anything big happens in the meantime i will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. i was very observant in our interactions, however, i didn't want to be so observant that i overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so i went with the flow and the vibes were great. we hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when i had the opportunity in conversation i mentioned that i had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and i told him that although i hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and i thought i might be curious to try it. i delivered this passively, just so not to put him on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. it felt like the time to make a move but i just didn't do it. we were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and i just didn't do it. it was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time i've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) we got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new nba 2k20 demo on ps4, i'll admit i'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but i kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. at the end of the night, around 11p i went to leave, i had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. i went in for our hug, when i pulled back i kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and i laid it on him, i went right in and kissed him. it was short, i didn't use much tongue, but i pulled back and said ""i guess i can say i've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, i guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, i had one on mine and it was fireworks in my stomach. i played it cool, i left and texted him when i got home that i was home safe and i thanked him again for a good time. he replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. he asked if i wanted to come over monday night for the notre dame game and a cook out, i told him i'd love to and i'll bring some ribs to cook.

we have texted as normal today and i can't tell you how excited i am for monday and to see what happens next. i know i waited awhile to update but i felt like i had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so i wanted to wait until i had more to report. i will post another update in the comment section here after monday.

thank you so much to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. i feel like i'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",8
"update i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. hey folks.

in proper internetiquette, i'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. i received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. even your scorn, some of you. i'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. but when i said before that i wanted to take all of it in, i meant it. i intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

to the meat and potatoes: **i got my money back.** it wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. it was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. i also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. i was surprised by the bride, but i welcomed it. you should welcome all positivity. i said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. i feel like, thanks to you all, i explored every thread in the tapestry of how i should feel and what i could say. it brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. you saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. you saved me from rash actions and words i wouldn't have been able to take back.

i know some of you will wish i went off. but i want peace, and what's the metaphor? bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? i just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what i'm trying to say is, i know now that i was just as responsible for how terrible an experience i had. this isn't a self-blame thing, i'm not being low-self esteem. the fact of the matter is, i could have said no, and i could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way i was treated. from so many of you i've learned that this is called self-worth. self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

don't get me wrong. i still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. it's their wedding day. and this goes double for people you're very close to. but you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. and yeah, i accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. but from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, i should have reassessed the relationship. measured my value without the context of groom's friendship and focused on that.

i think part of the reason why i took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, i could stand tall as the good friend and person i know i am. maybe some small part of me thought i could prove to the bride that i was someone she should have always counted on. show the groom how a groomsmen should be. this was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. you should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. this can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. i know this now.

so what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? i think he made that clear. if i was so important to groom, i'd have been by his side that day, but i'm not so important, and so i wasn't. this is fine. it was his decision, and i told him myself the day he told me i was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" it's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. certainly not me. not anymore. ultimately, this means i maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. i have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. when you find the right people, there is no chase. and one day, i'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. i don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. we won't have hella cursive name cards.

i want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. i was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. i'm not going to be a doormat, but i'm also not going to be fucking heartless. if people need help and i can help, i will. i'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. i know that i'm a good friend, and a great person, and i'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

i know that i still have my problems and i'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, i want to encourage you: i used to be so self-conscious about myself, i'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because i didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. i used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping i'd go away. i used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. i'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that i still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

i mentioned i was always an overweight person, but i should also say that i've lost 122lbs to date and i'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). at my average weekly rate, i'll hit my goal in less than six months. if you're struggling similarly, i want you to know that you can do it (dm for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). also, this was supposed to be a thing where i counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women i'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or i can't tell if they are (dm your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but i'm not so insecure about it anymore. i know that when women smile at me, it's because i made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. finally, and this is key, i know who my friends are, and i know that i never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). i know that my real friends asked why i was working the wedding. they asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't i the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. they tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed i was down. they invited me in to pictures. they said they wished i'd had a better time. they commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. they told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how i go above and beyond for people. they told me that, at some point, i have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. focus on these kinds of people in your life.

you'll have your lingering questions about this. i'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. if you have more questions, ask them and i'll answer. if you have more advice, i'm all ears.

i just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and i want to live up to that. the heaviness i felt was lifted, message by message, in your every positive thought and shared painful experience. you helped me feel not alone. i want this to be the standard for everyone moving forward. please, treat each other like good friends. if you are ever down, if you ever want advice, if you need to hear an embarrassing life story to bring levity to your situation (my life story is filled with movie-level embarrassment) please dm this account. i'm here for you.

&#x200b;

tl;dr i got my money back, i learned a thing or two, i'm your friend.

"my 22f boyfriend of 3 years 23m and i just had a huge fight over a tampon.. yes. you read that correctly. the subject matter is... a tampon. to preface, i took a plan b recently and with that comes your period. so today i woke up at about 7 am as i began my menstrual cycle. going to skip the tmi, and simply say i had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. i asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. just a straight up ""no i'm sleeping and tired leave me alone"" i tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and i really needed his help in that moment as i was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with ""no use a towel or something and you go get it"". i started crying bc i'm a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn't help me when i really needed it. he is the reason i currently got my period anyways (plan b). well i guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said i ""do too much"" and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. in the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. i know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. i guess i'm just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. was i being too dramatic or am i justified in wanting to break up over this? his reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. but to play the devil's advocate, he is a d1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before i move out and back home across the country. bc if i decide that there is no coming back (my parents wouldn't let me lol).

edit: he is home from practice. not sorry. not remorseful. still blaming me for doing too much. i can't stop crying. i showed him all of your responses and he said you're all wrong and i'm stupid for taking advice from reddit. i'm heartbroken.

edit 2: i fuckin love reddit man. i'm sitting here crying but every response i read makes me feel a little stronger. i'm the biggest cry baby ever and i really thought i loved this guy. so naturally i'm super sad. but i need this. i needed to be shown that this isn't normal or ok. thank you guys.

edit 3: ok guys.. tmi warning.. some are saying why didn't i just put some toilet paper in my undies and walk downstairs. i slept naked and woke up to blood all over my legs. ran to the bathroom and didn't want to get up and get blood everywhere. it was coming out profusely and i didn't want to get up until i was able to insert a tampon.",8
"my parents chose their new families over me so i moved in with my aunt. now they want back in. but i hate them. hi.

so i 16. moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

my father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. my mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

after all that i became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that i didn't exist and play happy family.

after a year i became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home i would never interact with anyone. both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. i wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon i was labeled as the black sheep of the family. every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. i was just so fed up that i packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. i took a bus and went mia for 4 days. ofcourse the police was called and when i appeared again i hit another lecture.

we got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and i told them i hated them. i called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

in the car i could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. we informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

my parents ways half assed our contact. appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. recently they tried to build more contact up but i was not interested.

i won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did i invite them to the celebration. and on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. i didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. basically i have cut them out of my life.

i am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. she got upset and called me crying and..... i just didn't care. it was like listening to a tv character cry. it wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again i didn't care.

as far as i am concerned my aunt is my only parent. she encourages that i build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. they tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and i just said no and left. i still resent them for choosing a new life over me. but i don't know if i am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. i don't want them in my life but would i be making the right choice? ""idk

edit : because people think o just made it up and i am a moody teen

you know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? that was the feeling i constantly had at their houses.

i know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. my parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. but not in the sense ""i want to have her longer"" but ""i took her last weekend! it's your turn"".

also planing fun activities for the day after i leave. my father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. they had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

they shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

when there are family functions i am often excludes. e.g my dad had a family bbq and didn't invite me 

they forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar starbucks gift card even when they know i don't like starbucks. 

so no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",8
"found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens. this has been going on for several years. i live in a small rural neighborhood with an hoa where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. as with most hoas, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. there will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. it really annoys my husband. i just laugh at it

well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. there were a lot of emails sent about this. a lot of drama. i don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

so then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. some people thought it could be deer eating them. there were several theories. the next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. this year it started happening again and people flipped out. all caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

it started out being funny because i'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. but this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

so anyway, you already know what happens. i walk down to the bottom of our property that i don't visit often and i find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

i went inside and told my husband jokingly ""i think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" he got this really weird look on his face and i had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

he confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. he was sneaking out at night to do this. i asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

i don't even know. this makes me really uncomfortable. the man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and i didn't even notice? why wouldn't he just tell me? like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

i don't know what to do. can anyone help me think this through. maybe i'm overreacting but i'm pretty upset

"my 33 m wife 32 f hit me at a family bbq. everybody laughed.. i don't think i'd ever felt more pathetic than i did at that moment. we'd gotten into an argument. she wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). i'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. i didn't think i should drive. my sister was also urging me to go. she was standing right there when my wife hit me. it was square across the face. i'd just told her there was no way i was driving since i'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. my wife called me an asshole... then wham...

my sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. everyone around us laughed. maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but i can't say for certain. nevertheless i felt humiliated.

the thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. it started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). it was infrequent at first. she was always super apologetic. over time it escalated. she started throwing and smashing things. screaming. berating me. hitting, kicking, and punching me. i don't even know how it got so bad. it just is and i feel trapped. who in their right minds would believe me? who would ever think she was capable of this? sometimes i feel like i'm hallucinating it all and i'm just losing my mind. she was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? i don't even know.

now people do know and it doesn't even matter. it's funny. i'm funny. it's so fucking funny. look at him getting hit by his wife. so damn funny.

i want to disappear. i would if it weren't for my kids.

i don't even know what my question is. i don't really have one.

is even possible to come back from this? i wish i could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

"my mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, i need advice. so i will try and keep this short.

i have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced i chose to live with her, i have always trusted her and so on.

now we have never been rich, but we got by, i have always worked since i could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

now because of this i quickly started saving my money, pretty much, i would usually save up at least half of what i made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when i moved out and such.

so i turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so i wanted to see how much i had saved.

well you can see where this is going, i looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so i freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so i yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. she started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. i know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, i mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. my dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

well this was 2 weeks ago, i have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

in the meantime i have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

now here is what i said, untill i have every penny back i wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do i doubt i will ever forgive her. i need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",8
"my38m wife 24f of 3 years, took my daughter14f to visit her parents in russia. wife doesn't want to come back. like above. sorry for ranting and any grammar errors i've been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. also this is a throwaway so i don't completely dox myself. 

my wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of st. petersburg, russia. 

my wife herself was born there, and came to the us when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (this is not a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). i was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

as she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the us. it just kind of happened that way. (she entered on a f1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we've been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the us with my family and one in russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

until last week she hadn't seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as i have custody. 

as school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it'd be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. she wanted to bring my daughter with her - i initially was opposed to this - but i caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

through her trip she hasn't been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on whatsapp and photos etc. which is understandable - she's on vacation and i don't expect constant alerts, but i would have liked a little more of an update. my daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

yesterday morning i had texted my wife that i'd be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. she read the message but never answered. i told my daughter the same and she never responded. i assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

i had a hellish day at work so i went right to bed so i could be up early to go get them. 
i wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and i look at my phone to message them. i see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn't know how to get home. confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 panicked i reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. she finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn't want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that i took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - i go off on her through text. she tells me off and stops answering me. 

i reach out to her mom through whatsapp (who doesn't speak english at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. her mom said she didn't know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

panicked i go to reach out the us consulate in saint petersburg only to find online it was shut down in march and the nearest is in moscow. i reach out to the moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a huge help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

my wife still hasn't answered me since our blow out. and her mom said she hasn't seen or heard from her since this morning.

what the hell am i supposed to even do with this? the lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me.",8
"i got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. after 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. i need help on how to handle this.. 
i am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

at 16 i slep with my good friend jared . the condom broke and my daughter was created. my parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. i couldn't bring it over myself to. i wanted to keep the baby. ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. so i did. i went to my friends house and his parents took me in. they weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

in that time my friend and i started to develop feelings for each other.

i had my daughter and about 2 moths later jared's  brother  came back into their life's. he was a recovering heroin addict. as we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. my parents got wind of that. they dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my mil also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

so they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. it was a dark time i thought they were going to take my baby. in the end they didn't find anything substantial.

but them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. as it was a small town every mistake i made got back to my parents.

i was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? cps charges because neglect.
i was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . cps.

christmas loads of people stayed at jared's house because it was a big family. cps because many strange men were there.

they eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. if they had done it more i think it could have been an offence.

the last call was 5 years ago.

eventually jared and i married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. we worked retail jobs and studied. it took us longer than average to graduate but we did. with a lot of help of his parents. jared is now an engineer and i work as a graphic designer.

we were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. our life's look normal now.

anyway a week ago i get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

i don't really know what to do. because while they didn't have to take care of my while i was pregnant i wished they had at least supported me. and while i get that they were panicking because they thought i was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",8
"my fiance took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant.. i'm in my late 20s and i got engaged for my fiance (29) who i've been with for 9 years. our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. but recently he brought up that he wants kids. i said no i'm not ready and probably won't be for a few years. he got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. i just moved on from it and didn't give it a second thought. 

a week later i couldn't find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but i couldn't find them anywhere. later that night he wanted to have sex, i said i couldn't find my bc pills and he said it's alright he'll use a condom, i supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. for the next few weeks we just used a condom and i didn't take the pill. in hindsight i should have got more when i couldn't find the original pack but i couldn't be bothered (my fault) 

on a few occasions we were having sex i noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn't say anything so i said stop. the next day i was putting the recycling in the trash, as i was putting it in i seen my pills at the bottom. i instantly knew he had binned them. he knows i deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

it all made sense so i confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn't answer me. he just kept walking away. i was so mad at him, it's not right. you can't just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. does he have to carry it for 9 months? 

i haven't been talking to him, i'm so annoyed. ",8
"update my gf likes me to go by different names.. tl;dr: most of you were right, she was sleeping with matt.


here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


i want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

after i made my post, i waited 2 days to say anything to her because i wanted to get as much input as possible. i also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

i started reading comments right after i posted. i replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, i started to feel sick. i called my boss to ask for friday off for personal reasons. i spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. we don't live together but i wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. we also have some good memories in that apartment and i think i would be sad if i had to continue to live there. 

this brings us to saturday, the day i promised myself i would say something. i invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because i was getting so nervous that i completely lost my appetite. she walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. i was hoping to ease into it, but i ended up blurting out, ""i met matt blank"". she tried to act casual about it, but i could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. for the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, i talked about how i see the past 4 months completely differently. she started to cry and say she was sorry, i don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. i told her i'm going to work on forgiving her, because if i don't i think it will eat me up inside. i won't forget what happened but i'll at least try to move on. she started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. i interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

if i wasn't so emotionally crushed, i would have been amazed at the transition. she started begging me to give her another chance. i stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. i told her that i had already made up my mind to break up with her. after some back and forth, she realized that i was serious. i knew the exact moment she knew i was serious because she went from crying to yelling. it started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. it started off that i was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and i had a useless job. in the middle of her tirade, she said matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

as she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. i'll summarize below:

she started sleeping with matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. from there it went from once in a while to once a week. matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. i think she was using the vacations because she missed being with matt. 

i don't really remember the rest of saturday. i spent sunday with my friends which helped, i told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. i went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. i'm not sure what it said because i burned it. ",8
"my (f 25) boyfriend (m 27) got angry when i asked him if i could put a face mask on him.. we were lying in bed and i was putting a face mask on. all i asked was ""can i put some on you?"". i just thought it was fun, i didn't think it was a big deal at all. but, i guess it was emasculating or whatever because he scowled at me and raised his voice saying ""do i look like a bitch to you?"". i said ""no i'm sorry"". i tried to just get him to relax and he did but i could tell he was irritated the rest of the night. he kept glaring at me and his demeanor was colder. it honestly bothered me, i wanted to cry i had to hold in my tears. i hate to be talked to like that by him. why would he snap at me over nothing? i wasn't trying to make him feel like a ""bitch"". i mean jesus christ. i don't know. it hurt my feelings. am i just being sensitive?",8
"i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone. i am sick, devastated and don't know what to do.. first time poster so i apologize if this is rambly. to preface: i started dating david (not real name obv) at the beginning of february.  only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship i was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that i didn't think much more about it. i fell hard and he did too. things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and i can't afford the place by myself). he and i have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and i have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time i've known him, so i didn't really see any red flags there. everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

last week i came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and i played it off like i had no idea what he was doing. fast forward to two days ago, i was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (i don't care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. so when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, i quickly peeked through his search history. there was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly ""teen"". i didn't think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then i saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. ""p*do pics"" etc had been entered around 5 times. 

i quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, i had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. i couldn't imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; i know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. so last night i peeked through his photos on his iphone and was traumatized. there were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while i'd fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. i felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

a bit further up in his photos i discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. they all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. i was numb, i was angry, i was devastated, i couldn't think and i was so disturbed at what i was witnessing. i have never seen cp in my life and i can't get these horrible images out of my head. i scrolled pretty far up and didn't really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the ""petite teen"" category. 

i guess i'm just posting here because i have no idea what else to do. i don't know how to confront him and i know i must separate from him immediately but i'm terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and i don't want to get in trouble. he must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  he practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially i am fucked by this. 


please help reddit, i feel so lost.

tldr: i discovered cp on my boyfriends phone last night. not sure how to proceed with anything.",8

well, it was time for the next round of shots recently.

the kids came home, and kept mentioning ""my poke"" ...... 

so he asked me if they got vaccines and i came clean. i said yes, and told him they started last year.

i apologized for not telling him. he wasn't happy.

no yelling, we talked more, and i explained the recent measles outbreaks nearby and expressed my concern for our kids.

all is well. no, we didn't even raise voices. yes we kissed and made up.

he understands i did things for the kids, and not against him.

"i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - update. hey! a week ago i posted about the fact that i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and i wasn't sure where to go from there. i was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! i think i was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

the following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. on thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. i was so nervous i thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. he said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but i was like no it's fine i haven't been home either, i knew it wasn't on purpose. the vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. and then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how i felt and he said 'sorry i'm not trying to make this a big thing i just want to make sure you're okay with everything and i want to make sure you feel respected'. i was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. i said that i was fine and that i felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. he said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. i said i agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

it was all really sweet and nice and i think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. at one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but i felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, i wanted to get to know you a bit. it was a spontaneous thing so i'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. we'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. and maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.' 

god he's great. anyway, sorry it's nothing too exciting but i had a few pm's asking for an update so i wanted to let you know :) i'm really happy with the outcome and i'm sure we'll be good friends at the very least.",8
"my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please. so here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. my girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, i finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company i did my internship at and within a year i got a promotion and a large payraise and i am now making roughly 150k a year, while she makes 20k a year.

now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place i bought so i pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, phone bill, netflix and so forth.

now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently i pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

now she seems to be jealous i got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs i put the majority in my savings account.

in my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

so what do i do, i hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if i am honest i am questioning my relationship as there is no way i am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

edit: so, there are so many comments i am having a hard time keeping up with it. if i don't respond, know that i am trying to at least read your comment. but currently when i read and respond to 1 comment i get 10 more! haha. i just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... even those who yell about mgow or something and those who are if the opinion i need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! i had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha.",8

"my (22m) gf(26f) of 5 years killed my pet snake (14 yo) as soon we moved in together. update on the bottom

update #2 on the bottom

update #3 on the bottom

so i'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that i had since i was kid. 

she always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

but to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. he has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

when we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but i couldnt cuz i really love my snake.

well now i came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

when i confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

i find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and i doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

i dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

i wanna confront her about it but i dont wanna seem like im being petty

edit: when i brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying i always do this?? idek what she even means by this



update: she dmd me this (im out rn) 
https://imgur.com/a/psbp9l6

update 2: i went to the lake to search with my friend i was chilling with, couldn't find the snake, and talk to the gf. were currently on break but were in the same house... not sure how thats gonna pan out

update 3: didnt sleep all night, went to the lake (15 minute drive), and i found the snake but unfortunatly it looks like it got attacked by another animal as it has huge marks on him and looks impaled. well with the gf, i am going to break up with her and go no contact but right now i have to find a way to get my name off lease papers and other documents too

"update: my babies and i escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3am last night... i'm scared, my kids are confused... i don't even know how i feel right now but nothing seems real.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av968z/my_babies_and_i_escaped_to_a_shelter_for_victims/

thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. i was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

a little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

the dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. my kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". he asks for daddy nightly saying ""i just want daddy be happy. i just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but i just tell him i love him and hold him when he is hurting. i realized even being here i am happier than i ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. i don't feel like i'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

the shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. my 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and i've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

they have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. the attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. they are also filing a long term protective order. 

we have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

i will be starting work again next week. my hr manager contacted the store up where i am now to have me transferred because of the situation. i am so thankful the company i work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though i've had to take the last few weeks off while i get things in order. 

the shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on wednesday for both children while i start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. the daycare facility is wonderful and i'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while i start work again! 

since i am able to start work again too i was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

i was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. i was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

a detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while i handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. the detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. so, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a class c family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when i was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a class a and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

he has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying i kidnapped the children and also filed a false cps report. i handed over all evidence to cps as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. he did text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but i didn't respond. if i even let him see the children until things get worked out i risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

his mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to florida so i would never see them again.... 

so, things are moving along. it has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but i've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. i feel like things are pulling together even faster than i imagined. it's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes i just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

i hope one day i can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources are available. it's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what i ever could have imagined and hoped for and i will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

"husband (31m) refuses to let me (23f) have a day off from the kids. me and my husband have been married for 4 years and we have 2 kids together (3 yr old and a 7 month old). i've been a sahm ever since we had our first kid and things have been going well for us. 

i moved away from home to be with him and i don't know anyone here. all of my outings have been with my husband. this weekend, a friend of mine is visiting and i told my husband i would love to have some time off so that i can meet up with her. he flat out said no and that he refuses to use his weekend to take care of the kids and the house. his reasoning is that he works hard all week and expects me to stay home or take the kids with me. am i wrong to be upset over his reaction?

edit: i'm so overwhelmed with the number of comments here + pms i've gotten. i can't thank you all enough. some of the questions hit close (like not having access to money, making a big deal over having any contact with friends/family) i didn't realize that i may be in a bad place. i'm sorry i'm not able to reply to you all!",8
"update my 30m wife 29f more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. i don't know what to do.. here is my original post:  here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0c1kd/my_30m_wife_29f_more_or_less_abandoned_me_and_the/)

i wanted to thank everyone for your help. this isn't a super happy post, but i felt the need to update. 

a few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in english that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. but she thanked me and told me she loved me.

the funeral was held in korea last week, i went with the kids. her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. they also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

however this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. even then there is a big language barrier between us. my ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

i still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. i don't really know how to feel about this at all. 

just wanted to thank you all for the help and support.",8
"i (f25) found out my fiance (m27) is with me for money/family business. to preface. my family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. thus i am a trustfund baby. i try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
i met my fiance mark when i was 20 and working as a waitress.

we began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

now mark is not poor. he is upper middle class. and while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. i thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. what i want to say is that i never had the impression that mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

in the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and i stood up for him and fought with my dad. they came to love and accept him. when mark graduated dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

sunday i was supossed to work in the evening and i was going to stay with my sister. but i got a fever and was basically just non functioning so i stayed home. instead of staying in our bedroom i made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (i didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so i just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

mark came home when i was fast asleep and i was woken up by loud voices in our garden. i pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark was there with a few friends. just as i wanted to say hello i noticed that they were talking about me.

his friend kept laughing and calling mark ""the man!"". then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and i am free"".

at this moment i felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. i kept hearing them calling me trust fund barbie and stupid and so on. i didn't know what to do so i just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. i texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

i haven't returned home and just told mark that i was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
my sister has been really worried but i just feel so ashamed about everything. my family was right mark is a gold digger and i fell for it. even if i tell my family what happened i have no proof. my father can't fire him just because he is a dick. as far as i know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him i think. i just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

edit : we are non us. mark wasnt talking about anything else. he has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it i helped pay it off. there is no way he wasn't talking about me

edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. i opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. we have called up dad and i will talk to him tommorow. i will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

edit3: some questions have come up.

i don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. i mostly uber arround

i worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and i don't anylonger

i don't work for my father i am a company shareholder and i have to go to the general quartal meetings but i don't work for him.

i am sure that it wasn't a fever dream. it was arround 38.5c and while it was enough for my body to hurt it wasn't enough to have a vivid dream. by pass out at my sisters o don'team literall medically passing out.

last edit : i am really tired that you guys are defending him saying that it could have been a joke. guess what. it's not fucking funny. you don't degrade and disrespect your partner for laughs. you don't go along calling them stupid, trustfund barbie, stupid bitch and you definitely don't make remarks yourself. i don't understand that macho bravado as many of you have called it, but i don't think that's okay so stop with those comments. it was deeply hurt full.",8
"my wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. i'm angry with both of them and my wife is acting like i'm being unreasonable. advice?. obviously, i keep some guns. just for hunting and sport shooting.

i've got four rifles right now and i keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn't too interested. after some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why i like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

so over the last couple months i have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. she's been learning a lot and doing a great job. and she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

she had a friend come over this morning. i already don't have a high opinion of this friend. i think she is kind of an idiot, but she's also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. i've gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. but she's at least harmless so i never worried about her too much.

so this friend came over today. i figured the ladies would just chill out or something and i kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so i didn't get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

at some point i saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but i didn't think much of it. half an hour later i heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

i freaked a little and ran into the barn. i found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

in the immediate moment, after i saw the ladies were okay, i took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

so with all that sorted, i wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, i started to get mad.

i'm not necessarily proud of the language i used, but i'll try and portray it accurately since i am asking you alls opinions.

i asked the girls ""why. the. *fuck*. was one of my guns pulled out?""

friend didn't say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

so then i asked why it was loaded. i *know* i clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so i know there wasn't a round in there. and i keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and ""accidentally"" pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

they were making a ""woops!"" face that kind ignorant upset me more. and it didn't help matters when my wife's friend started telling me that ""every rifle she is used to"" has a different kind of safety mechanism and-i don't know, i stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

i locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

she approached me and just said ""sorry"". i was still mad so i told her something like ""yeah...'sorry' isn't quite going to cut it here.""

and then i asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. i know she knows better because i taught her!

i told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn't know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!""

my wife started getting defensive. she told me i've taken her shooting on our property before. the effect was the same here, right.

i told her, yeah, we've gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. we *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!""

wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. and i got a little mad again and said something along the lines of ""yeah, and it's a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!""

my wife finally said it was just an accident and i didn't have to make such a deal over it, i told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

she walked away and as she did i said something to her like ""do not go in the gun safe again without asking me."" she got re-pissed at that and asked why i'm treating her like i'm her ""dad"". i told her that those guns are registered to me and i don't want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn't need to have it.

and thats where we've been all day. we're kind of just avoiding each other. that sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. she is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. this is the only real shouting-argument we've had and it really bothers me that she's throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake i probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

i *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because i never do that. and what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. so i'll probably apologize for the cussing here once i'm a little less angry.

so what should i do to handle this now? first big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. i don't want to talk down to her, but i do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or i'm not sure i'll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. there is also the matter of her friend. like i said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it's like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. that is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but i've never said anything because it wasn't that big of a deal before.

how should i approach this? how do i get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can i get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like i'm trying to be her dad?

**tl;dr**: my wife pulled out one of my rifles without my permission, gave it to her friend, who then fired it negligently. i'm super pissed, wife is pissed that i'm pissed, and it's all a mess now. help?",8
"my boyfriend (21m) hates my (20f) vagina with a passion. i recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn't like my vagina. he said it just looks unappealing and he doesn't wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. he gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so i didn't push him to continue until i finished and i said he could stop. he doesn't like fingering me either. he basically just said that he doesn't like looking at it or anything. he said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

so i thought i had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. my inner labia are not long or stick out and i'm an innie or whatever. i taste and smell fine. i think he just doesn't like vaginas. but he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it's just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. no attention down there. i do cum but i have to touch myself because he won't do it. it's just basically like he's having sex with me and i'm masturbating like rubbing my own clit so i can get off too. i don't wanna force him to do anything he doesn't like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? he's 100% straight and he likes boobs and he's attracted to girls and he likes when i wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. he just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. his penis is not beautiful i still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. idk it's weird. 

my friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. my friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they're always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. my friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. my boyfriend doesn't even like to ever look at my butthole. my boyfriend thinks it's disgusting if i get too wet and he said it's like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if i drip onto his sheets and dirty them. he will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that's it. i get jealous sometimes. i wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. it sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. it's like he hates me for having a vagina or something. he's never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. g",8
"(update 2) my roommate's (21f) parents keep letting themselves into my (21f) apartment with the spare key she gave them.. okay guys, i'm sorry for updating you guys late and for the super long post, but i want to make sure i get important details in there.

tldr: my family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

i think rm is crazy and needs a mh checkup. seriously. i am very worried for her wellbeing. 

my mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. i told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. my mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

when my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. i've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
my mom called rm and rd and r to come over to talk. they came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. she made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and i could tell this was pissing rm off. some points of the confrontation:

1. why are you calling my daughter these names?
rm: i didn't say anything. she's making        up lies. 

2. why are you even in the apartment that much? you told us that you go there once a month to check on r. you also said she visits you every weekend?
rm: the kids don't know how to cook, so i help. also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. why are you going through my daughter's stuff? why does she need a lock? why are you limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*i shall also mention that roommate's dad was sitting in their car on the driveway during this whole confrontation*

but things got heated up really quickly. rm started insulting my parents:

- she said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said i am unruly and that the clothes i wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). this annoyed my brother, and he showed rm ig pictures of r wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. rm shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- she then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""god complexes"". this pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" this pushed rm off the edge, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted to slap him. 

this lady tried to slap my 24 y/o brother in front of my parents. 

they argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. this time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. she came back to where we were standing and literally threw the dress in my face.

my mom had no more patience left, and back slapped rm across her face. i've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and i burst out laughing. even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of rm. rm started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

when they left we had a big discussion:

my parents were angry that i never told them about this before. they said that they got me that apartment so i could do what i wanted. they wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
however, they are very proud and happy with the way i dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. thank you all for the advice. i appreciate it alot. ❤

they were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of r cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

my parents agreed that letting r live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. my parent's started the eviction process today. 

anyways, it may be hard to believe, but i do stand up for myself a lot. it's just that in this situation, i didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because i had respect for their friendship and i didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. i learned from this, and i have growing up to do, but now that i know i have support, i won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

i also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't indian). no one is living rent free in this situation. 

i would also like to say that even though i wasn't friends with r in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

also my parents are liberal ass indians. they have lived here in america for over 40 years. they didn't want to spy on me at all. they don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

edit 1: i forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, i don't think it does. i'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. also, it's my parent's money. they'll do what they want. this gives me no excuse to have a gpa less than a 4.0, js. 

edit 2: i took out the part where rm tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  it was funny though. 

edit 3: i added a tldr. 

i included most of the important points. if something doesn't make sense i'll reply in the comments. 

the cops are yet to show up. 

edit 4: guys we forgot to ask for the key back. fucking damn itttt

"i (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f). so our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so i gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. turned out to be new activations, no big deal. although, while on the main page i noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. i expect her to have a lot of texts. i got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when i text her at work cause shes busy.....who could she be texting? i decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

i honestly dont know what to think. my curiosity got to me and i started plowing through old phone bills. this number started showing up on august the 8th. since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. often into the wee hours of the morning. shes never mentioned any new friends... 

so i get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and i start helping her find it. i found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. i hate being that guy but i did it. checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. some dude . she has him programmed first and last name. checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and i also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

i love my wife and i trust her completely, i think. i dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. and actually now that i think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 i really dont like the direction this is heading. am i reading to much into this? we've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. we havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. not for lack of trying on my part. shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. anyone have any advice?

tl;dr wife texts dude over 16k times since august; shits pointing towards infidelity but i'm trying to rationalize her actions...",8

hello everyone, i said that i'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response i got yesterday. in many ways, i was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but i found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200b;

i spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. he basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. we had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning i went back to the flat and confronted her. she was there (neither i nor her work on saturdays), and i set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner i could.

&#x200b;

 basically, i said that i didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. the wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. she basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". look, i'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. i basically said that over the weekend i'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (i'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but i stood my ground and didn't change my course. not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200b;

i left, and there is nothing much more to say really. as i type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). i'll be grand, being totally frank i feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  the coming days i'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".

"my 26f girlfriend 24f thinks she's an instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!. when i met my girlfriend 3 years ago, i knew very quickly she was addicted to instagram. she was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

this didn't really bother me at first - i actually found it kind of hot? mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - i felt, i guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then i think).

other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. every day is punctuated by ""insta time"" where i'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for instagram content... it's ridiculous. we've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, i'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. i'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

it was routine stuff, i asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

so the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. she desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. she's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but i didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for ig, she was actually trying to make money from it. i know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. before you say it - yes, i'm probably going to break up with her. but the thing is, she's got a really good heart and i genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). is there anything i can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",8
"insecure gf caught flirting. throwaway for obviousness. this is gonna be a long one. 

where to begin? girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. friends, coworkers, acquaintances. even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

fine. i love her. i understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though i've lost sleep over it. 

girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. one of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. while i can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. some of these stories i've never heard before. call it insecurity but i've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. i asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. what?

a few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. we've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

but where is the line? he's already had her describe herself. explain past relationships. sex talk and favorite kinks. taking until hours in the morning. where is the fucking line?

i told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me i have nothing to worry about. 

well. 

i just looked at her phone.

and while i wish i didn't. i'm glad i can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. they've been flirting. the questions via text were 10x worse. and her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her s/o. 

but what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that i'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that i'm creating disorder. then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. and her saying yes. 

not even 2 full days into 2019 and i'm about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

username checks out. 

do i ask for advice now or am i on the right track. i need clarity...

thank you for making it this far. 

tldr - girlfriend who made me end friendships due to her insecurity ends up flirting with a guy she met 3 days ago and accusing me of being insecure about it. her texts determined that was a lie.  breaking up with her unless i'm overreacting.",8
"updatei (14m) have no connection with my mother(29f). my mom was raped. i don't know how to handle this.. i posted yesterday about my issue with my mom. i finally had the courage to talk to my mom about our relationship and i wasn't prepared for it.

we were alone and i just asked if she loved me. i called her mom for first time in months. i wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. i just ranted to her without letting her speak. how i needed her attention and it's affecting me. i played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. i asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. i would stay out late just so that she would call me. i flipped and told her she should have never had me. i fucked up.

i made my mom cry that night.

she told me that she did love me. 

she revealed that she was raped by my dad. he was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. she became depressed and carried me full term. she is still recovering from her depression. my grandparents wanted her and i to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. at first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. this is why she has been distant from me. she doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. in the end she just gave up. i remind her of her rapist but she knows that i am gentle and kind. i didn't know what to say, i just hugged her. it was a hard truth to swallow. i told her that i will always be there for her. she told she didn't know i was hurting inside. i told her we can start again from scratch.

my mom joked that i scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. i cried as i went to sleep. i can't blame her anymore and i should make a better effort to be more involved with her. i want to support her. i'm not going to break off contact with her. i going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy. 

i'll try my best to be a good son. thanks for the advice.

i wanted to ask if there was any advice on helping family members overcome depression.

edit: thank you for all the support. i will get my grandparents involved to search for a good therapist for my mom and myself.

"posting an update to my story using the throwaway format about my sil(14f) accusing me(26m) of impregnating her.. since this is basically over now i'm posting an update on what all happened. the old post was deleted for not using the throw away format so a quick summary. leaving out a lot due to this being mobile and way to much shit went on to cover here.

my sil who is 14 got pregnant and when her parents found out she lied and told them that i was the father.  my wife left to be with her family when this broke and her father was in a rage.  i got a lawyer.

the lawyer i got told me i needed to pack up take of work and stay somewhere we're my wife and her family wouldn't know where to find me.  boy was he right.  the next day our apartment was broken into by my fil and completely trashed with a baseball bat.  my neighbors called the police obviously and he ended up getting arrested but bailed out by my mil the next day.

my wife's entire family constantly texting and calling to say how horrible of a person i was.  my lawyer met with the family and their lawyer to tell them i denied all the accusations and that i wanted a dna test done.  after the meeting the texts and calls switched to calling me a coward for accusing my sil of lying.

this went on for a few more days before the mounting pressure finally broke my sil's resolve.  she came clean  and told everyone who the real father was, being a 15 year old at her school that told her to make something up.

when this news came out i still had to go through some whole bs investigation to show that i wasn't actually a secret child predator.  

i'm self employed so we will see how bad this whole episode is going to screw up my life and i'm definitely pressing charges against my fil for the damage he did to my apartment and threat to my life he posed.  

contrary to what most people on here suggested i do i am not going to immediately divorce my wife.  our marriage was amazing before this happened and i don't want to throw that away over a stupid 14 year old and her boyfriend.  i've seen my wife a few times and told her i understand why she did what she did and that i still want to be with her given that i will not want to be around specifically her father or her sister for a long time and that before we move in together again we get marriage counseling.  she agreed to those terms and we have been to a few sessions separately and together now.  

thanks for the input i got on the old post.

edit:  lot of people are acting like this whole situation continued even with dna evidence proving i was innocent, that's not the case.  there never was a dna test and likely won't be now that sil admitted and the actual father confirmed it.  the threat alone of a dna test is what made her tell the truth.

i also said i'm not immediately divorcing my wife, it may come to it after we have tried counseling but i don't know at this time.  yes i'm hurt by my wife not believing me but at the same time we've only been married for a year and a half and she basically raised her sister while her parents worked and has always been very close to her.  

my wife didn't cut contact with me through this i did at the direction of my lawyer.  i left my phone with him and looking back through it now she never accused me of anything was just asking questions trying to figure out what was going on.  

my fil acted out on his own by breaking in no one knew what he was doing and i don't have any sympathy for his actions and am pressing charges for everything he did.  he broke in not used my wife's keys to get in.  the door frame  was completely destroyed.",8
"my daughter is dying of complications from cancer. my wife and i don't agree on final interventions. how do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?. i apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. too much ugly crying.

we have been battling cancer for many months now. her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. she could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. the other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

if she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt cpr. we have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

if she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. on top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

i don't want either of these interventions as i feel she has gone through enough. my wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. i don't want her to suffer any more.

i don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. we have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. a part of me feels like a pos for not wanting to try anything but i just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

what do i do to find common ground. i tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. my wife and i have agreed on a plan. we are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. please support childhood cancer research. no parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: i appreciate all the advice and i want to give another update. firstly, my daughter is only 5. i don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. either way this all happened rather quickly. last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. she was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called vod which came on her very quickly. within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

she does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. the medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. she has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

my wife and i decided to try intubation again but say no to cpr. she was intubated a couple hours ago. so far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. both my wife and i are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions.

unfortunately, for the past month, she's started to insult me for everything. for example, i could not hear a line of what she said over facetime because of internet issues and she flipped saying i don't pay attention to her. proceeded to call me names or whatnot. usually, i just took and it moved on. however, today i just snapped and told her to leave me alone. so i proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and i check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

i just ignore it because i really did not feel like it.  then she tells me she's bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. i honestly think i'm traumatized from those videos, i can't seem to get them out of my head and i feel responsible for them. i texted her father, however it was late so he's asleep. thankfully she's still alive and i've managed to calm her down by apologizing, but i don't feel right. 

i feel trapped, and very fucking sad. i feel as if i'm a monster and i'm causing her to do these things to herself. i never say anything badly to her, i just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. i apologize for my rant but i don't know. my emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

i hope i can get some advice. for some insight, i don't ever insult her, not even jokingly. she gets annoyed that i don't give her attention, but i text her and hang out with her as much as i can possibly give, i am human and a student with responsibilities, i can't spend 24 hours with her.  

that's really all. 

update: 
just a slight update. i have been in contact with her father and i am being updated on what's happening. they are seeking professional help for her and i feel that is the right choice for her. i am very exhausted and haven't really slept, so i'll try and give updates as i can. fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. in my case, i've decided it's going to do me harm if i continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

my mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and i'd much rather regain my positive nature. i am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. i've read every story and the decision i made has been influenced by your own experiences. i will try and reply to all the messages, but i apologize if i miss anything. i'll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. i have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and i hope she comes to see what i chose to do a few years from now.

thank you!
if my spelling or grammar sucks, i'm pretty exhausted, i apologize.

"update i 25m got ghosted by my girlfriend 23f of 2 years.. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvawkw/i_25m_got_ghosted_by_my_girlfriend_23f_of_2_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

thanks everyone for your support. i actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. i didn't know she'd be there. she said hi to me like nothing was the matter. like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. she looked great and i wish i hadn't gone to the party. i was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. but seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

after the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. she said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when i was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. just like that. she said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). she said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

i said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. she apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. she said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

i just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. so she just decided pretending i didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

i can't say hearing all this helps. i don't really even have much closure. but people wanted me to update and so i did.

thanks for all your help guys. wish it was more interesting than it really was.",8
"my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry?. my wife and i are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

when i was in my 20s i donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (i literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). i've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. always. and she has always said she's okay with it.

fast forward to yesterday i answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" obviously i have no idea what the fuck is going on, so i ask her to explain what she's talking about.

turns out this girl is my daughter (i understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when i didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. after turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. she called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. apparently my wife told her that i wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman i loved could be so fucking heartless. so for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when i was home.

i tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that i did not say any of that. we organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night i blew up at her. honestly, i've never yelled at anyone as long as i can remember, but i couldn't hold it in. 

am i wrong to think that's so severely fucked up of my wife to do? i honestly can't comprehend how she could say that. i'm not thinking straight and need some advice on how to deal with this.",8
"i 22f read my parents' texts and found out my immediate family pretty much despises me.. i honestly don't even know where to start here... i haven't lived at home for the past four years of undergrad because i function better when i'm not around my family all the time.  i think and function differently from them, which is something i thought was ok and not a source of conflict until this morning.  i'm moving in a month for grad school so i moved back home for the summer to save a bit of money.  the entire summer both my siblings and my parents have been very nasty (mostly in the way of exclusionary and passive aggressive behavior) towards me despite minimal confrontation or conflicts occurring.  it's been really upsetting but i've tried to push it aside.  i've heard them talking about me behind my back on multiple occasions and even seen text messages over my sister's shoulder between her and my mom calling me disgusting and really just trashing me in any way they know how.

i am aware that what i did was wrong / i shouldn't have done it, but my dad went to the grocery store and left his phone at our house.  everyone else was sleeping and morbid curiosity got the best of me, so i opened it (he doesn't have a passcode) and went through he and my mother's texts together.  i don't know what exactly i was expecting to find, perhaps a few sparing texts about me, i don't know, but i was completely shocked to find that the majority of their conversations are about how much they despise me.  like this is to the point where they purposely plan family lunches/dinners/movie nights/etc when they *know* i am working or otherwise busy and invite me even though they know i can't go so that it's not obvious they don't want me in attendance.  i'm not even worthy of a name in their conversations, as my dad merely refers to me as ""the bitch"" and my mother follows suit.  my mom says things like ""it's so funny how she acts like her life is so great but she can't be genuinely happy because she is the most miserable bitch i have ever met.""  they say i bring down the mood, i walk into the room and i'm a bitch, etc.

there are also several texts where my dad will message my mom complaining about how annoying i'm being and she will respond saying my sister and brother are also texting her the same thing and they'll laugh about it.  so while i'm in the room with my entire family, they are texting about how insufferable i am.

i think the worst thing of all is that my sister outed me to my entire family.  i came out to her in december after being closeted for years and it was a very huge step for me to do this as my family is not very supportive of the lgbtq+ community and i was terrified to tell anyone.  i told her i wasn't ready to share this information with anyone and she turned around and told everyone in my family about it.  they are ""sickened"" by my ""lifestyle"" and have no issue with her mistreating me because she disagrees with my ""lifestyle"" (yes, that is what they are calling it).

growing up i was always straight-laced, kept my head down, and did what i was supposed to.  i am good in school and got involved with community service/volunteering and excelled in varsity sports.  i've also worked since i was fourteen.  i pay for all of my expenses and never ask for a thing from my parents.  in college i had a 4.0 and i got into multiple top phd programs straight out of undergrad.  i won multiple prestigious awards in undergrad whose ceremonies both my parents never bothered showing up at.  i am the black sheep and they abuse me for it.

i know snooping was wrong and i'm not sure what i expected to find doing something like this but damn, this hurts like hell.  i've always felt generally ostracized and sort of disliked by my family but i tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety going into overdrive and brushed it off.  but these were not mere hunches, they are true.  i feel sick to my stomach and absolutely numb, and i'm honestly not sure how i should proceed from here.  should i try to bring things up with my family?  should i just bide my time for the next few weeks until i move?

tldr: i knew my family was talking about me behind my back so i read my parents' texts and found horrible messages about me and also found out that my sister outed me to my family.

&#x200b;

**edit:** thank you so much everyone for the outpour of support, kindness, and advice.  i initially really just needed to get this off my chest and find a soundboard in the reddit community but you all have rallied and helped me significantly.  i am trying my best to respond to your numerous comments, messages, and pms offering support and love but there are a lot to go through so please know i see you and appreciate you very much!

some people have shared that i've come across as very superior- and pretentious-sounding in the comments.  i want to apologize for that and express that this was not my intention.  i was simply trying to share that i've had multiple achievements that i would like to *share* and *celebrate* with my family, but instead they seem to scorn me for them.  success should be shared amongst families, not be a divisive factor!

**edit 2:** just going to answer a few of the common questions i'm seeing in the comments here.

* yes, my family is religious.  they are catholic.  i am not religious but keep quiet about this and still bow my head in prayer at supper and participate in everything they would like me to.
* no, i do not spew my political beliefs to them or anywhere near them.  in fact, i hardly talk politics.  i do not post my views on social media or engage in political discourse on social media.  when my parents are talking politics, i merely listen respectfully and offer no opposition to what they have to say.  i pick my battles, and politics / religion are not battles i prefer to have.
* yes, i have friends.  no, my relationships outside my immediate family are not negative.  i generally get along well with others at work, school, and in social environments.
* my relationship with my extended family is positive and healthy.
* no, i am not adopted. 

&#x200b;

**edit 3:** copying and pasting a response to a comment on the thread.  a lot of people are confused about how much my family's mistreatment of me ties into my queerness.  here's a bit more context that i definitely should have provided earlier:

the issues with my sister started after i came out to her! this is definitely something i should have clarified, i'm sorry. here's the story:

i was dating this really awesome girl in december who has been out and proud since middle school. i was falling for her and realized that it wasn't fair to her to have to be dating someone in the closet, so i decided it was time to start taking steps towards being out. i figured baby steps were the way to go, so i started with my sister. my sister and i have told each other a lot of private information in the past and i thought i could trust her with this. i was initially hesitant to tell her because she has made ignorant homophobic comments in the past and casually uses slurs such as ""dyke"" and sees no issue with it. however, one of my good friends told me that her family was the same way and when she came out they realized how horrible their behavior had been, felt awful about it, and apologized profusely. so i figured that if my sister knew about me, maybe she would realize the weight of her unkind words. i told her and she was definitely surprised/caught off guard by it and acted a little awkward. but after that nothing happened and no mention was made of it. she began just acting a little stiff and awkward around me which over the course of several months has escalated into resentment and bullying. now mind you, my parents have been resentful and harsh towards me for the past several years, but my siblings at least usually had my back and i felt like i had some support with them. but once i came out to my sister, things slowly started to change.

in early july, we were at our cousins' house and i was in the bathroom. the house is small with thin walls and i overheard a conversation in which my sister and brother were expressing their disgust towards me because of my sexuality. so i realized at that point that my sister had outed me to my brother and now to my cousin. at this point i realized that she was really betraying my trust and clearly didn't care much for my privacy and well-being, but i still didn't think she would tell my parents, knowing their thoughts and opinions on gay people. well, she did. i'm not sure when exactly, but in their text messages they were excusing her mistreatment of me because they understand that she does not agree with my ""lifestyle.""

i'm going to paste this comment in a third edit on my main post because a lot of redditors are confused at lacking context. well, here is some more. this situation is complex and something i am struggling to make sense of myself, so before you make an unkind comment calling me things such as a ""bitch,"" a ""whore,"" and a ""cunt,"" among other slurs, please realize that i am in the dark here as well.",8
"update 2 my ex girlfriend (21f) spent the night at a random guys house.. sorry for making another post but i got a ton of messages saying what did she say etc. like 30 so i'll just make a quick post 

basically she saw my text, freaked out and did the whole ""no you're not breaking up with me, i didn't do anything, what are you saying, we're still together"" and she said she's getting a flight home early. i just ignored her texts 

she also called me about 100 times for our ""morning facetime call"" and i declined her. i wanted to tell her that i had a girl in my bed and we're eating pancakes but that's petty af so i didn't 

yeah idk if i should talk to her when she gets back or just ignore her. i kind of just wanna be done with her. even if she didn't cheat it's not right to be in bed with someone else and stuff that's not ok",8
"i (29m) just spent another awkward holiday with my girlfriend's (28f) rich family. my girlfriend and i have been together almost 3 years. 99% of the time, we're great. she's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. but every time we visit her family i start doubting everything. 

they are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. i come from a very middle class background. i have a good education and a decent career that i really enjoy, but i'm definitely not rich. because of this, they view me as a loser.

for example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish honda. when we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. she was furious we didn't bring gf's land rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. gf doesn't like to drive on long trips and i'm not allowed to drive the land rover (per her parents) so we brought my honda. 

gf's dad has never spoken to me directly. even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""what does he do?"" so we went in the house and i gave her dad the usual, ""hi, merry christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

one more example: last year i made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. it was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and i even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. gf's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to gf they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

we managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which i'd normally consider a win. but today i keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if i'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. gf and i have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but i know they'll never accept me. if we get married i'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. gf has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but i can tell it bothers her too. they bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and i think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

so, not to sounds like an asshole, but am i wasting my time? is this relationship doomed? gf always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but i'm not sure that's true. she always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. but i know i'll never be good enough for them, even if i'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: my girlfriend's rich parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",8
"my boyfriend told an old crush of his that he's single.. we've been together just over a year now. i went on his computer (facebook was already open on a tab) and i saw he was talking to an old crush of his. she said she was single and when she asked him whether he was in a relationship he said that he wasn't. she even asked him why and he said he didn't know. i don't know what to think now because this seems really out of character for him.

edit: we broke up.",8
"update gf and i (26m/f) got into a huge fight over a keyboard. previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

short edit at bottom.
&nbsp; 

we met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. i was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so i suggested we meet at her place, so that i could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

even though i thought i made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my gfs coworkers figured out who the post was about (gf's age, working hr which i mentioned in a comment, same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my gf. the reason she wanted to meet early was because she was furious that i had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' in a sense, i guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. my gf never used reddit so i figured i was safe.
there's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that i made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. i asked her to point out any part of it that wasn't true, or where i had lied. long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. i definitely raised my voice when i told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. i told her i only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. the post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

she began to tear up and asked me if i really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. i asked her if she understood that this wasn't about the keyboard. it was about the way she acted towards me when i was trying to do her a favor. she stayed silent and didn't answer. i asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was ok with her. i asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

she got really defensive, asking ""are you calling me crazy?"" and ""do you think i'm unstable?"" i had no idea where she was going with this. i told her i wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that i was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

we talked in circles for a bit, and i tried to pry it out of her. i still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. when i realized our conversation was going nowhere, i finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. she asked, ""what do you want from me?"" and i said, ""i want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

i'm getting tired of typing so i'll wrap this up quickly. she was absolutely unwilling to apologize. she thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. we talked for about 5 more minutes before i told her that i don't even care anymore. i told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. that we should just break up. i didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

as i was leaving, she asked if i wanted the keyboard back. she didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. i could tell by her tone of voice. i told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

i've been getting tons of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my fb). she obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like i really did leave her over the keyboard. i couldn't care less, as i'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

we only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, i don't feel terribly heartbroken. mostly just relief that it's over. but...also confusion. still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

tl;dr: she wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. after an exhausting conversation, i decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**and to the people who had some unkind words towards me because i use a razer keyboard: pound sand, dorks. i like what i like.**

very short edit: she called earlier today and was very apologetic. my assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how i was right for leaving her, among other things. i told her that she had her chance to apologize.",8
"girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time"". so before your read, i need to say i have nothing against cuddling to sleep. i actually love it.

the problem i have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

and honestly i wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

but no, she doesn't want it like that. she absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

if i just start to get sleepy (wich i am because i want to sleep), she will get upset.

she absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because i have to keep my eyes open too.

she also needs sweet talk, wich i like but not when it's forced like that. she literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""i love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what i think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... and honestly i have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. and we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like i never say it.

but the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. and that can take some time. sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

i know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with so, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when i tell her i'm tired and i want to sleep.

if i say i'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""no ! don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so i have no say in it.

seriously, i think she's just being too clingy and childish. is it unreasonable to just say ""good night i love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? i don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if i don't do enough.

i feel like i have no control over when i can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for several hours.

honestly i wish i could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but i can't. it's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when i'm tired.

could i have some insight ? what do you think ? am i being unreasonable ?

thanks for reading.

**edit: thank you very much to all of you guys, your comments and insights have been really helpful, i will continue to read your replies and answer some of your question. i feel a lot better about the whole thing, and now i'm confident about moving forward and putting a stop to all this. i will talk to her and make her understand that she needs therapy if she wants to make it work.**

"boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship. my bf and i have been together for over 4 years. when we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. we stayed together long distance until i graduated and moved back home. we have lived together for about 2 years now. 

life was very rough for him when he dropped out. his parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. he is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. because of this, i have lent him money over the years. i was very fortunate in my situation where i went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. i have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. one thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. i am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. he told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. my perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (for example, we moved last week and i wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) it makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. but he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

i am very confused about our relationship right now. he will not remember this when he wakes up, but i don't know how to approach him with the things he said. i love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. but if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should i be doing?

edit: i've changed the ocd to perfectionist. i'm so sorry to everyone i offended!

edit 2: i'm crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. thank you to everyone who responded, i love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don't get a lot of love in their lives. 

a little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. that was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",8
"update: i 34m broke up with my 33f girlfriend in the nastiest way possible because of what happened yesterday and today.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9g0n3/i_34m_just_discovered_the_real_side_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

so after i went home yesterday, i cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

i called her, she accepted my call and said ""what?"" i told her ""i'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

i texted her, ""i need the copy of my house keys back, i'm breaking up with you.""

she didn't respond. i got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

i looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. so i texted her ""where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

i drove back home and i noticed her car parked next to my house, i carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there i see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my ipad...) that's when i tell her ""what are you doing?"" 

she tells me, ""i'm taking back what's mine."" that's when i tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""get off me."" she started kicking me and ran out the house.

i tell her to give my shit back or i will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so i whip out my phone and dial the cops.

she drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my ipad.

cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and i told them what happened and i tell them the location of her house.

they sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

the cops start asking me questions like ""is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later i got my stuff back.
she has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

now i'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick.

edit: for everyone questioning of how she got arrested on the same day, she let the cops in and confessed what she has done.",8

i stated they can be friends, but i expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something i'm comfortable with, and i try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because i know better.

i expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

she doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200b;

i don't think she cheated. i know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. some men are okay with that, i'm evidently not.

&#x200b;

she's a wonderful woman, she's just not the woman for me.

she wants to act like she's single, well now she is.",8
"my husband wants me to get a boob job.  we've been married for 6 years. i have smallish breasts which i am ok with but my husband is often suggesting i have a boob enlargement. i don't want to go through all that pain, i have always been this size and was like this when we met and it never seemed to bother him then. am i right to be upset? i have tried saying i am happy the way i am and that he was happy enough when we met. why is it now an issue? i don't want to feel insecure but i am starting too. he also often talks about his hair as he's becoming bald, it's absolutely not a problem for me and i made some small jokes about it in the past but he's convinced it is a problem. he wants to get an hair transplant and he usually brings that up when he talks about my boob job, almost like he would undergo that procedure ""in exchange"" for my boobjob. he'd probably look better with more hair but i still love the way he looks now and i don't need him to change. we're having less sex lately (about one time every two weeks) and i'm always initiating, i'm starting to feel rejected and insecure. what should i do?",8
"update: i'm 37/f unexpectedly pregnant. my husband (35/m) wants an abortion and to keep it quiet. i'm not comfortable with this. what should i do?. my original post was some time ago, so newcomers may not have seen it. 

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50axee/im_37f_unexpectedly_pregnant_my_husband_35m_wants/



i wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. first though, i'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. for the most part the community came through with useful advice. i really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. i thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


an now on to the update. i'm 39 now and my husband is 37. i was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. i told the therapist about the advice i got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. i went through with the pregnancy. my husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. he decided to stay. 


not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. i see the world in a different way now that i have her. he loves our daughter with every bit of himself. amazingly my love has grown for this man. he has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. i understand what he means. the happiness that i feel is beyond words. both my husband and i are so thankful that we had our daughter. we talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. to top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


so thank you, reddit. your support helped me through a difficult time. i hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update. 


edit: holy schmoly reddit. pinned and gilded for the first time! thank you for the gold, kind stranger. thank you to all of the wonderful, positive messages. i have read and appreciate every one of them. i'm glad that sharing my story brought a smile to so many faces (or tears of joy in some cases!).

"my husband committed suicide saturday and i'm wondering how to handle this regarding our 2 year old. i absolutely don't want him to know that he took his own life... ever... i'm sure that's a conversation to be had when he's much much older. like an adult. i don't know. but i'm confused right now. i want to show him pictures but is that wrong?? is reminding him everyday harder? he's been saying ""i want my daddy to be here"" or ""my daddy is at work"" and he doesn't seem sad. just confused. i know he feels all of this. my mother told me it's a bad idea to show him pictures constantly. i just feel like... i don't want him to forget his dad. this has been so hard. i just need some guidance. i start counseling monday but i need other opinions. this morning we sat here and looked at tons of pictures of daddy and he smiled and seemed so happy. what do i do... i just want to be strong and do the right thing so my bubba feels loved and happy.",8
"my mother (50f) asks me (20f) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15m). hi everyone,

this morning i was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. she has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. he is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. he does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. if he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. i would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. he has just not grown up. my birthday day out to london was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and i was called selfish as a result. i am 20, i've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.

previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. yesterday, she called me to ask if i would come home from uni on wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. a sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. i am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. she had been preparing for this for a while. i said i wasn't happy about it, but i didn't have plans that day, so fine.

this morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. i thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. but actually she now wants me to come back tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. tuesday evening is the only time i get to see my boyfriend this week, so i said no. the reason she wants me to come back is so i can wake my brother up for school wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. i told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. at this point i just said i wasn't having this conversation and hung up. i then text her to explain that i don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, i have a busy day on tuesday, and it's just not practical. plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. i shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school.

so, am i being unreasonable? i understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. i am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. if my brother had to be left alone for days of course i would come back, or if something sudden happened. but he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. he should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

any advice at all would help.

tldr: my mum is going to a funeral on wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15 yo brother up for school. she has a history of babying him and i'm a university student with my own life in a different city. am i wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as i have other plans? edit: typo. 

update: i called my dad to explain the situation and he said he agreed with my mother and that i was a disappointment to the family. he said it was not about what they asked me to do but that they rarely ask for help and when they do i should always help where i can- it was the principle that counts. he also said i was opening a can of worms and that there's a lot i should be doing at 20 that i'm not. when i asked what i should be doing he said driving, which is ridiculous as i live in a big city and the only reason i'm not learning is because it's too expensive and would be useless when i can easily bus/train everywhere. he knows this. he then repeated he was disappointed in me and i hung up the phone, upset, after saying i don't know want more they want me to do. i had a job i've saved my wages from so i can budget accordingly, i do well at university, i am good with money, i have responsible friends and a great boyfriend, i make time to see my parents when i can. currently feeling very hopeless and deflated. thank you for your support though, everyone",8
"thinking about abandoning pregnant gf.... my gf is pregnant and i was really excited to be a dad when i first got the news. problem is we went to prenatal screening and found out there is a high risk of down syndrome. a follow up diagnostic test confirmed the baby has down syndrome.

i want an abortion because i am not prepared to raise a child with down syndrome. this is not me bashing down syndrome people by the way, it's just not something i'm prepared to do. my gf doesn't want an abortion though so there's nothing i can do about that.

at this point i'm considering just ending the relationship. i'd pay whatever i'm required to by law, but otherwise move on with my life. my gf obviously decides whether to take the pregnancy to term, but i feel like i have a right to leave given how immensely different a child with down syndrome is as far as responsibilities and future grand children.

anyway, i'm asking for advice about how to break the news to my gf. i obviously have to tell her asap so that she can make an informed decision.  but i don't want to come across as manipulative.

i realise i'm coming across like a heartless prick here, but i genuinely care about my gf and want to do this in the best way possible for her emotionally",8
"(update):my mil exposed my (28f) past group-assault to my husband (34m). who had no idea. wants him to divorce me. please help me.. tldr: mil told my husband and their family about my assault after stealing my journal where i wrote about it in detail and how it caused my infertility. hubby and i are solid. she then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the christian thing. 

hi guys, i just wanted to give you a quick update about a post i made 5 days ago on here. you were very kind to me. thank you. it got locked and deleted because i had the wrong username so i've just made another account and added the ""throwra"" to my normal username lullabelleanabelle, so i can make a quick update for this subreddit. i'm not sure if i'm allowed to link to my post because i posted it on another subreddit too. a lot of you suggested i go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. thank you everyone. you're wonderful. 

to clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if i may). i'm not american, european born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. we met at his friend's wedding where i did the bride's makeup (i'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). we had some serious words, mostly where i told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and i fell hard. and you guys are so right, he is the best person i have ever met. he's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. and he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. so i think i'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. he's just my world. 

it hasn't been easy. a few things have happened and i can't honestly say that i'm better off for it. but i'm trying.  again, really not a troll post. i'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. this is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

i didn't know how to tell him. or what i wanted to tell him. a bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, i didn't want to show him ever. so, i told him i could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. they aren't particularly easy to read. those men weren't very nice to me. they had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. and they had gone to jail. 

he got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. that i didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if i didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second i was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. he'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. he wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. he said he was so scared that i would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. and he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. they were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. nothing malicious or accusing. 

i thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. she'd taken pictures of the parts where i described things that had happened almost too vividly and then i had pointed out ways i could have defended myself and questioned why i hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way i looked and wanting them to do those things to me. its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. it was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so i didn't have to think about the ways i could have stopped it. maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all i had, i never went to therapy. she put in her message that i had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof i was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

his sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. and to the other siblings and some others in the family. fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

things haven't been going well. my husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. he's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. he won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. he owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. but i'm trying to get him to not do that. it's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. i don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

as for me, i'm just in a fog. i don't know how to process what she did, so i'm not going to until i'm ready. my husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. i think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. i'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. it sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. i hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows i thought like that about myself. i never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. its just shit. 

i won't be posting on here again. 
thank you all for your lovely words. i hope you take care.

edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. and thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much i must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. no.",8
"update: i 22f just found out my boyfriend 27m has been having sex with me when i'm sleeping after i've taken sleeping pills.. previous post can be found here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/) but the tl;dr is in the title. i have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. i'm pretty much dead to the world when i take them. recently, about 2 weeks ago, i found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while i was knocked out despite me saying that i wasn't up for sex before i fell asleep. i woke up that day because i was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. he didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200b;

now for the update. after i found out what happened, i went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. i'm so incredibly lucky to have him. it was from his house that i made the last post. after that post, i was replying to the comments until i fell asleep. the majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that i need to break up with him and report him to the police. that was something i didn't wasn't to have to do. when i woke up in the morning, i had almost 600 more replies and i got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what i was going to do. so that is exactly what i did.

&#x200b;

i had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. i wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why i wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. i went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200b;

so i called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. i started to explain everything to him and why i had to go away for a while. the conversation was going okay at the beginning. but then it took a turn. as soon as i brought up the fact that i wold him no to sex before i feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. he started yelling. he started throwing things. he got scary violent. telling me that he knew i was insinuating that he had raped me. saying i was accusing him of something very serious. i hadn't said to him that he had raped me. i hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that i was going to give him another chance.

&#x200b;

then things took another turn. in my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. i don't want to come off that way so i am not going to disclose what happened. i'm still trying to process everything and wondering how i could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200b;

i just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. you have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me i was the one who was wrong. i'm sorry i didn't listen to you guys. i was wrong. but i think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision i had made. maybe it was better that way because now i know for sure. i don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now i'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200b;

again, thank you.

&#x200b;

edit: some people have asked of he is now my ex. i guess i didn't really directly say that he is. we are no longer together. and never will be again. even if i decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

&#x200b;

edit 2: it's come up a lot. people are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. my brother did report him. another thing people keep asking is what happened. call me an attention seeker if you want. i don't care anymore. what i left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. if my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. it's so embarrassing, not just that i was almost taped but that my brother found me like that.",8
"i(f32) just found out that my husband(m36) has a full blown secret family because his ""other wive(f29) "" just knocked on my door.. sorry if this sounds so vague and incomplete. i am confused and my eyes are all swollen up

i thought that i had a pretty happy marriage with ""jonas"". we have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. we have twins (f8).

jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. during this time he will visit us and we will visit him. it is i convinient but he earns really good. so good so that i needn't work if i didn't want to.

during all those years i have never suspected him if cheating. he was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

so this comes all of the blue for me. jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
a woman knocked on my door. she introduces herself as ""cherry"". when i asked her what it was about she broke down crying. i took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about jonas. apparently she and jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

we were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. he has 2 different sets of social media accounts. and as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

at first i was livid and screamed at her. till i calmed down as she was just a victim.

apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if i visit) trough some bank statements. she searched his keys and went snooping. there is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

we both cried our eyes out together. cursed out jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

she is not legally married to jonas as he sold her the ""i don't believe in marriage spiel"". the only legal spouse he has is me. i know i have to divorce him but maybe i just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. also should i keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

edit : i guess reddit only takes stories serious if it has happened over and over again.

thanks for the few helpful advices i have gotten and a serious fuck you to the people making fun of me or calling me a troll. i honestly thought that someone would listen to me here but i guess it's if i wanted that i needed to have better grammar and a less crazy story.

thanks for the people that did tho. cherry has left and i will pick up my kids from my sister's right now. i will be leaving the house for a few days to get my ducks in a row and begin legal proceedings",8
"should i end my relationship with my gf for ruining my birthday?. this may sound petty, but i am genuinely pissed and don't know how to handle this situation.  i don't usually do much for my birthday, just normally go out to eat.  yesterday being my birthday, i asked my girlfriend if we could dine out at one of the local mexican restaurants on my town after i got off work.  she said probably not, as she was going to be pretty busy that day, which is understandable as she is currently going to school and is nearing midterms.  a couple of hours after getting home from work, i got a call from her asking to pick her up from the very restaurant i asked if we could go to, as she went out with her friends and got a little tipsy.  i of course went ahead to pick her up, as i didn't want her to drive home drunk.  i haven't said a word to her since, and she doesn't seem to understand what's wrong.  i feel hurt and unloved, and don't know how to approach this.",8
"update to caught my (27m) girlfriend (24f) masturbating and she started crying. original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bt4yar/caught_my_girlfriend_24f_masturbating_and_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

damn i got a ton of great advice on my post, thanks guys. reading your comments made me realize that i'm probably a dumbass and should have thought about it more. she didn't have any trauma but her family was pretty religious and conservative growing up which i relate to, my parents were the same way and they never talked about sex or anything. but it was different in my house, they knew or assumed i would jerk off, they said little things sometimes and acted like it was completely normal. i got her before she fell asleep and asked her about it. she told me that they never mentioned masturbation or sex (we had our own ... interesting problems with that too) as if it didn't even exist but she knew it was bad and she couldn't ask about it or anything. 

it was good, we had a long talk about it like a discussion, we were just talking. no judgment, it was nice, i missed her. basically she had only started doing it when she was 19 and she liked it but always felt guilty afterwards because she felt disgusting. she tried to stop and it was hard and she saw it as a big personal struggle but she eventually ""quit"" around probably a year later and hadn't done it for a long time. so when we met, she was masturbation free and wasn't lying all this time when she said she didn't do it. 

and then when she walked in on me, she started thinking about it and just started doing it again sometimes because it was fun and she still felt guilty so when i saw her, she felt embarrassed. she admitted that her teasing me and mentioning for weeks was her projecting and trying to make herself feel better in some way. i told her it was completely fine and normal and her private business to do what she wants, no fap or pro fap. obviously i didn't change her deep rooted views so quickly. i tried telling her that i knew she felt gross but my view of her didn't change at all and i still love her the same and she liked that and gave me a hug. so that's that. she didn't cry again but she did talk to me with her head under the comforter. i know a couple comments told me not to do this but my brain screwed up and i said that it was so hot and i wanna watch her. she felt embarrassed and told me not to hold my breath but maybe one day. we're good now. had breakfast together and she was fine and back to normal. 

thanks for all the help. i knew i wanted to bring it up but all the pointers and lines really helped. we talked for a while and opened up an interesting discussion, it was good. 

some people mentioned that she may have been thinking about someone else, had someone hidden under the covers or our sex isn't good. that's definitely not it lol. and just wanted to say that the comments calling her a hypocritical bitch are really fucking weird. i did not make that post thinking ""wow my bitch girlfriend has double standards, i should have continued to tease her, it's what she deserved, she made jokes on me for weeks, how fucking dare she, i'm gonna get revenge"". i love her, she's my girlfriend, not my enemy. i can take a couple harmless jokes about choking the chicken, it's not that serious. some of you guys have a concerning lack of empathy. and the comments about her being immature and needing to grow the fuck up and act like an adult. again, real lack of empathy. no one's perfect, everyone has their own problems.",8
"i m28 just broke up with my girlfriend over something she f27 posted on facebook. justified? did i overreact?. so we've been together about 7 months. we've had plenty of issues, but always managed to work through them and come out the other side a bit stronger. but something i found tonight just churned my stomach and it affected me so much i ended our relationship.

some backstory for context: about 2 weeks ago we had a minor argument. it started in the morning, we paused the conversation for the day while we went to work, then talked about it that night. we both got kinda heated but eventually agreed that we were arguing about something ridiculous, and reached a compromise, and everything seemed fine.

fast forward to tonight. we're laying in bed and i realize i never accepted her facebook friend request. i literally never use facebook, so this wasn't a point of contention or anything. but we weren't doing anything else so i decided to accept the request and check out her facebook (she was right next to me the whole time).

what i found really upset me. multiple shared posts that were obviously in reference to our relationship. they were just pictures of text that she had shared, not actually written herself.

the first one i found was this: ""hey, here's a cool concept: treat the people that are important to you... like they are important to you..."" i think ""hmm, is this about me?"" i feel like i make her feel important all the time. i drive 30 minutes to her house every single day. she had a birthday and i did all the things that you would expect: multiple presents, dinner, i offered a movie and drinks but she felt sick and we didn't go. i often buy her things just because. i offer her lunch nearly every day to show i'm thinking about her...

ok, maybe i'm overreacting on that one i think. that post could be about anything or anyone, so i keep scrolling. i see another one: ""if you push me away, i promise you, you won't find me where you left me""... hmm, this one obviously sounds like she's talking about our relationship. and i was a bit upset at seeing it. especially considering i never felt like i was pushing her away. i spend literally every free moment i have with her. she got upset that i wanted some alone time. she says she doesn't desire it, doesn't understand why i need it, so i pretty much did away with my private time to spend more time with her. we are constantly doing things together, and make plans to do things and go places. i never felt like i was pushing her away. if anything, i felt like i spent most of my free time trying to think of things we could do together.

i keep scrolling, and i found the one that hurt me the most: ""don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. what you won't do, someone else will.""

that one absolutely killed me. i never thought i was taking her for granted. and the thought of her not feeling appreciated kinda floored me. on top of that, the implication is that she wants to find someone else who apparently appreciates her more than i do...

i confronted her about these posts. she said they don't mean anything. that she didn't even think about it, and that it took less than a second to hit the share button, so it's not a big deal.

i took a bit to collect my thoughts, and then i went back through our text messages to each other. turns out that every single one of these posts was made when we were in the midst of an argument/spat. that last one, the one that hurt me so much, was shared by her during the day after we had the minor argument and before we had talked it out that night.

it just felt so terrible. like, we have a very minor disagreement about something and you're thinking about finding someone else? that's what it seems like to me. am i out of my mind for thinking that? she made me feel like i was. she said i was overreacting. that she felt that way in the moment, but not now. but i can't stop myself from thinking ""if you feel this way after a minor argument, how must you feel after a serious one?"".

then there is the whole issue of airing out our dirty laundry to anyone that happens to be friends with her on facebook. anyone with a brain knows what those posts are about. by sharing them, you are essentially announcing to the world ""i'm having relationship problems!!!"". i can't help but think about the things her family and mutual friends must think about our relationship considering how often she is sharing things like that (they were all posted within this past month). to an outsider, i must seem like a fucking asshole. not treating her right. not respecting her. not making her feel important.

i just felt disgusted. i felt like i was going to vomit. i just kept seeing the words ""what you won't do, someone else will"". i know she didn't write them. but she thought them. she agreed with them. she broadcast them to the world.

i told her i knew myself well enough to know i wouldn't forget it. that anytime we had any minor argument, i would be thinking ""guess she's gonna go find someone who respects her more than i do"". i don't think i could deal with it. knowing that anytime we fight, she is having these feelings. instead of wanting to work it out, she is thinking about finding a new partner...

i broke up with her within an hour of seeing the posts. it was ugly. i feel bad. i feel tired. i've had no sleep and i have to work in like 3 hours. i don't even know why i'm posting this. the relationship is over. maybe i overreacted, maybe i was justified. i just know it felt right.

edit: lots of people saying i jumped to conclusions. i do not feel i did. the conversation went like this:

me: *scrolling through her feed for the first time* ugh, why do you post stuff like this? there is a lot of them. (this was more just general dislike at posting such childish things)

her: why? do you not like that i do that?

me: i mean... it kinda feels like you're just announcing our relationship issues to everyone.

her: but those posts could mean anything. they could be about anyone.

me: i just have a feeling that if i went through our texts and found the days and times we were arguing, they would line up with these posts.

her: yeah, maybe some of them...

we left it at that for about 10 minutes, then i decided to actually check those times and dates. they all lined up, i went through the first four shared quote thingies and they all matched with times we were arguing about something. i stopped at four because the pattern was clear.

i then confronted her, and she confirmed she posted them during arguments. i may have jumped to a conclusion, but imo it wasn't a very far leap. and she confirmed that i was right.",8
"fiance has dropbox folder of all nudes and of sexually explicit acts from all of his past exes and hookups—including coworkers who doesn't know he has them and women he's said he's never been with.. me: 30f
fiance: 38m

we've been together for 5+ years and engaged for just the past few months. throughout the course of our relationship, a few women would constantly reach out to him. when i asked about them, he told me that they were just friends and that nothing had happened between them. 

this past week, i was playing a game we play together on his ipad when a questionable text came in. i went into the text messages and found out that he had been lying about talking to and grabbing lunches with one of his current friends from work. being really angry and insecure about it i then went through his phone. we have access to each other's phones to play each other's dumb games when one of us isn't felling well but i have always respected his privacy up until this point.

what i discovered was a dropbox folder with a bunch of folders with women's initials. in each folder was pictures of nudes his ex's and hookups had sent him, pictures of him or her performing sexual acts on each other, and pictures of me that were taken while i was so black out drunk i couldn't remember them being taken. 

several of the women in the photos were women he swore up and down to me were just childhood friends/coworkers and that i had nothing to worry about even though he had daily conversations with one and the other would text him heart and i love you's. 

after some discussion he admitted that some of the pictures he had taken off of his coworkers computer without their consent. he is an it professional with access to all of his coworkers computers. 

i checked through time stamps and i don't believe any of this was sent during the duration of our relationship together. i am still very upset that he lied about his relationship level with several people and the pictures he had of me and that he violated his coworker's privacy as well.  he insists he has never gone back to this folder while we were together. i feel like i'd be very disturbed if i were one of these women and knew that he still had these photos. 

regarding the original girl, he just didn't want to tell me because he thought i'd be mad. i am much madder that he lied than that he has a female friend that he gets lunch with.  after we hashed this out, i asked him if there was anything else he was lying about or hiding from me or if there's anything else i should know and i wouldn't get mad. he lied. two days later i found this personal ""porn"" stash. 

i am so shocked and have no idea what to make of this situation. am i making a bigger deal out of this than it really is? is this grounds for ending the engagement? the relationship as a whole? part of me wants to tell these other women what he did but at the same time i just forced him to delete the whole folder permanently so it couldn't be restored. 

he claims that he had a sex addictions the time that he was still working through as we started dating which i'm sure i can believe but i don't have any experience with this but i'm just so overwhelmed and caught off guard that i don't know how to make a rational decision right now.

edit: first i want to thank everyone reaching out. this relationship has been very hard for me since the beginning but i was always made to feel like my feelings were crazy and that he was doing nothing wrong. i can't help but doubt myself even though i know in my heart that this just isn't right. i'm shocked, upset, disturbed, disgusted, and so many things right now. i feel like i can't even turn to my own friends and family because i'm embarrassed, as has been the case since pretty much day 1. i probably should have left a long time ago but for some reason i always felt like i was to blame. what's going on is beyond not ok and i am now figuring out what my next steps will be. thank you again for all of the support.

edit #2: regarding the ""secret porn stash,"" it wasn't porn from the internet. i was referring to his collection of photos from women from previous relationships. i was always ok with him watching porn and we both did it together. i was disturbed that he kept the photos of exes though. it was also from more people than he had admitted to being with which was another lie unearthed.",8
"update i (19f) snooped on my brother (23m) and found something horrifying. link to previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cf6oib/i_snooped_on_my_brother_and_found_something/)

we just returned home from our vacation, and the last two days were hell on my imagination. i know i said in the last post that i wasn't going to do anything about it, but i found that i couldn't just sit there and pretend everything was alright. 

so i spoke to my brother.

we were alone, though our mother was in the house. it filled with lots of crying. he basically confessed to having those fantasies, but said that he would never hurt me in real life. i only read one of the stories, and apparently many of his other works also included me. i told him that he already did and he promised to stop publishing new ones and to get rid of/change the old ones. 

he asked that i not tell anyone about it (would ruin his life, he said) and in exchange agreed that he was going to get therapy when we both return to our colleges in the fall. sounded fair, so i agreed, and we ended the convo with a hug at his request. 

in a sense, it felt like a really weird break up. not sure how to better describe it. we most definitely will not be able to have what we used to have in the past, and i hope any awkwardness at future family events can be overcome by time/distance and a butt load of therapy. i'm glad it was sorted out, although that convo was definitely one of the most awkward ones i ever had. 

hopefully this is the only update i need, and thanks for listening :)",8
"daughter's friend (f18) is making me (m45) uncomfortable. i have known this girl for years. she always was a sweet girl and one of the things i always liked about her and my daughter was that they were never the type to be 14 going on 40. her family life is stable as far as i know and up until around 6 months ago she treated me like an adult - that is, a vaguely human shaped object that dispensed lifts and shit music.

&#x200b;

but around the time of my wife leaving my daughter and i, she and my daughter started making jokes between each other about getting me a new girlfriend. when i'd overhear, i'd ignore it and the two of them would go all red and embarrassed.

&#x200b;

then it seems to have escalated to her getting uncomfortably flirty with me. i acted dumb initially, but had to actually say something to her about it, because it was getting way too... frank? it stopped for a while, but after turning 18, she started up again and just made fun of me when i try to tell her to stop.

&#x200b;

so, to avoid anything else, i cut myself out of giving rides if she was in the party or being anywhere where she might be. but the past two weekends, she has called me in the middle of the night drunk as hell saying that she is going to walk home if i don't pick her up. so i pick her up, she gets really handsy to the point where i was having trouble driving, and every time i stop, she tries to put my hands on her.

&#x200b;

the first time i got her home, she got herself under control, and while her mother raised an eyebrow, she mostly believed my denials of getting her into this state. the second time, she didn't and it was bad. i was telling the truth, and even i thought i was a sleaze. i told her mother that i was indeed stupid for not calling her instead and should the girl try anything like that again, i'll call her instead of going anywhere.

&#x200b;

i really don't know what is going on here. i am a balding, overweight middle-aged man who feels like i am the butt of a joke somewhere having this 18-year-old acting so obsessively over me. i have spoken to my daughter about it who initially thought it was funny, but after a conversation with her friend is now kinda worried as well.

&#x200b;

i am sure that something else is going to happen, and i just need some advice on getting her to realize she should be with boys her own age.

&#x200b;

**\*\*edit: for the silly dickheads saying the equivalent of ""fuck her, hurr""\*\***

i have known this girl for 10 years. she was less than three feet tall when i first met her. she has come to sleepovers, birthday parties and family holidays. she has reached an arbitrary age that has confused her and is still learning the power of her femininity. she is acting in a way that could be dangerous around the wrong person.

i want her to find true happiness in her life and i want her and my daughter to stay friends so they can lean on each other during the difficulties of adulthood. the last thing i want is to mess up a young woman's mind and emotions for the sake of an orgasm. i am fairly sure it would mess me up as well.

**so for fucks sake, lay off the porn and have some god-damned sense.**

&#x200b;

**2nd edit: a few questions answered**

1. my relationship with my wife broke down because she was ashamed of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and refused to treat it. she became dangerous to live with and was arrested after a violent incident. she blamed me for her arrest and moved away. there has been no contact from her since she left. i have no ill-will towards her, but at the same time want nothing to do with her anymore.
2. my friend's daughter lives with her mother and sister. she has very little contact with her father. for example, he did not show up for her graduation or her prom but did send a card for her birthday. the mother is an immigrant from greece and can be very dramatic over things that aren't a big thing here.
3. i gave her a ride because i have fostered an environment of safety over discipline with my daughter and her friends/boyfriends. when i was that age, i did not call my parents when i was high or drunk because the discipline was often worse than whatever danger i was in. i am known in her friends circle as someone safe to call when they need to get home without giving any grief. my daughter's friend is not the only one i have given rides to.
4. my daughter initially thought it was funny and that her friend was just messing with me. when she spoke to her, my daughter didn't tell me much but agreed that i have to stay away from her.
5. it really breaks my heart to go no-contact with her as she is the oldest and closest friend of my daughter. but at this stage i have to.
6. i don't really drink anymore and on the rare occasions i do, i am usually camping with the dog at least half a day's hike away from the car, so would never drive drunk.

"i build my (26m) relationship on a lie and i dont know how to tell my gf (24f) or what to do.  i met my gf on tinder and she had a picture with a dog so, of course, i commented on it as i broke the ice. we talked a bit and she turned out to love dogs and i just said that yeah, dogs are great, because she seemed sweet and cute and i wanted a date.

things progressed but we never met in her place because she had 2 roommates who acted like bunnies (if you know what i mean) so we usually would hang out at my place. i only really saw her dog when i was picking her up and i would never come in so i had no interaction with it.

thing is she moved out to her own place last week. she now wants to hang out at her place. i would be very happy but her dog will be there too and...

i am really, really afraid of dogs. i know i should've been honest from the get go but back then it seemed like such a small thing to lie about. i mean, how many tinder dates go beyond a hookup? and then the more time passed the more embarassed i felt. especially since she would say that her dog breed gets so much bad rep by ignorant people and i just... how can i tell her i'm one of those people? except i'm afraid of all dogs, not only hers so really it is worse?

how do i fix this? i don't want our relationship to end because i can't man up and just act like a normal person when i'm in a room with a friendly dog... i fucked up and i dont even know what to do here",8
"update: i (27m) have unknowingly been using my gf's (27f) ex's molded dildo to get her off. previous post:

so, we had the talk. my relationship is over. after some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late saturday, i brought it up. she again tried to deflect and change the subject, but i demanded we stay on topic. i told her outright how i felt, how i thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. she tried to play it off like i was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. then she spun it into a penis size issue. i kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her ex-bf and not the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. i told her i wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and i was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

the conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say i have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. i knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so i outright told her the relationship was over.

thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. they were helpful and confirmed my feelings. now i guess i will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. i'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

"my(37m) wife(39f) just told me that she initially faked love when we were dating me only for the money and admitted to cheating on me. but she claims that she fell in love with me after we got married. i need some advice here.. my wife and i have been married for 8 years and we dated for a long time before that. i own my family business ( fashion and jewellery ). we have 2 daughters.

first off, i'll be honest with you guys. i'm not an attractive person. i look average at best. i don't have a chiselled body, but i'm fit. my wife is really beautiful and i always wondered what she saw in me. i was bald at 19, so i hope you guys get the picture.

when i was in my twenties, i was very awkward and introverted. i didn't date many girls, because no one was interested in me. i met my wife in college. we had similar interests and i fell in love with her. i asked her out and she said yes. i was on cloud nine. and we never looked back. 

yesterday was our anniversary. we had a small celebratiion. when we were about to sleep, my wife started crying. i was really worried because i did not understand why. she hugged me and told me that she wanted to confess something. she ended up telling me that she faked her love for me when we were dating. she also told me that she cheated on me when we were dating. but she fell in love with me a couple of years after we got married. she told me that she really matured at that time and realised that i was the mist important person in her life. she also claims that she never cheated on me once we got married. she told me because she really felt guilty. she told me that she would do everything to make it up. 

i was really devastated. i always kind of wondered what she saw in me. and i think i have my answer now. i'm broken. i also know that i only know this because she confessed. i don't know what to do and i need help moving past this. can you guys help me with some advice?

edit: thank you guys. i have decided that i'll do a paternity test and make my decision based on the outcome.

edit2: also, i've asked her to move out till the paternity tests are out.

edit3: though she fell in love with me now, i think i've fallen out of love now. i think i'm done with this relationship. thank you guys. i gotta work, so i won't be replying anymore. once again, thank you for listening to me.",8

so i invited her over to my place last night and i awkwardly blurted out that i was falling in love with her and i see our relationship going somewhere. she laughed and and asked if i was asking her to go steady lol. she told me she felt the same way. then we got a pizza and some beer and binge watched a show. and i woke up this morning with her snuggled against me.  it was perfect.

"my (28f) boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) are going on a week-long vacation. they uninvited me.. my boyfriend wanted to go on a vacation this summer to his mom's friends' house in hawaii with me and his two best friends (25m and 29f). we had been planning on this all spring, and at some point, 25m dropped out of the trip, leaving just the three of us.

for context, my boyfriend and i have been going out since november, and it's been serious. we had (and still have) been talking about moving in together and he has said, and i agree, that this is a long-term situation and that we are in it for good.

in early june, once 25m unexpectedly dropped out of the trip, 29f called my boyfriend and told him that now that it was just the three of us, she didn't feel comfortable with me going on the trip, since she didn't know me that well and she didn't want to be a third wheel. she said that if i were to go, she wouldn't go on the trip. without telling me that this was happening, they changed the plans and made it a trip just the two of them and they changed the location to a beach in costa rica.

i was trying to figure out when to ask for time off this summer and hadn't heard news about the plans, so i asked my boyfriend which week in august i should be setting aside for the hawaii trip. he let me know that, actually, he had talked to his friend and that she didn't want to go if i were going, so he was going to go alone with her to costa rica. he said that we could go another week later maybe to mexico city or something.

i was upset, and tried to talk with him about how the situation made me feel, especially since this wasn't a case of a separate trip being set up ahead of time -- this was a case of me being invited and then uninvited from a week-long tropical vacation with a girl friend of his who i had never met before. we eventually decided to do a trip together to copenhagen, which we have both wanted to visit, as some sort of compensation. i also asked to meet her, so that i could feel more comfortable with the trip.

we spent the 4th of july going to see her and her boyfriend in the city where they live, and although it was nice to put a face to a name, it was ultimately a very cold trip and she was not at all welcoming to me. my boyfriend remarked on how unfriendly she was -- to both of us, he thought -- and said that he was surprised that she didn't act warmly to me. i went out of my way to try get to know her and her boyfriend (i'm very outgoing and friendly and usually this would be easy), but it didn't really click, even after several days. they were somewhat cold to each other as well -- they bickered a little bit about their future and his own 3 week trip without her that was scheduled for the same time as their trip (this had been scheduled before ours had).

this had been my effort to feel better about the trip, so i told my boyfriend that i still didn't feel comfortable with things, and that i was feeling insulted by the way that it was handled. i had tried to make things smooth between all of us, and i asked him to please come up with something that could help me feel better about the trip.

on a visit to his family, they asked about the trip and they were all shocked that he would have arranged it this way, and let me know that they would have been furious if they were in my position, which triggered a fight in which i asked him to please help come up with a strategy to make me feel better and more secure about them going together without me. he said that he would never do this kind of thing again, which feels like not much to offer, since this is kind of a once in a lifetime trip to begin with. he kind of offered to not go on the trip, but he had already paid for the tickets and made arrangements and i didn't want to stop their trip and be resented by both him and his best friend.

he asked me to give him ideas of how to make me feel better and wanted me to just tell him what to do and stalled and stalled until it was finally the day of the trip. he bought me a bag of peanut butter cups and i drove the two of them to the airport.

i feel so disregarded and disrespected in this situation. i want to break up with him, but i don't want to burn up something that has otherwise been really good.

tl;dr - i (28f) was uninvited from a vacation with my boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) and i can't get over it. i want advice on how to talk with him about this.

"just found out that my 25m fiancee 25f has been bullying my best friend of 20+ years 26f.. hi all.

i've been together with hollie for three years and i proposed to her last summer, with a date set for springtime next year. she's an investment banker and the most gorgeous girl i've ever seen. we met on a night out. we moved in together after a year in an apartment that her parents are paying for. i thought hollie was ''the one'' from our first date, but now i'm not so sure. 

i'm best friends with a girl called sarah. we've known each other since we were little kids (grew up on the same street, parents knew each other, etc). i had a crush on sarah when we were kids and had feelings for her throughout our teenage years, and she claimed to feel the same, but over the years we both dated different people or had other things going on in our lives. 

when i introduced hollie and sarah, it was clear that they were two very different people, but whenever i'm around they've always been civil to each other. however, sarah has told me that hollie is always giving her dirty looks and disagreeing with everything she says just because. i never noticed the former but the latter has happened quite a few times. 

however, sarah confessed to me that whenever the two of them are alone together, hollie is actively cruel to her. making comments about her appearance, her background, her family, etc. i did not believe this and actually distanced myself from sarah to protect my relationship with hollie (who has been telling me to get rid of sarah when i told her what sarah had accused her of. 

i've not been that close to sarah lately because of this, however, some of my friends got together at my best friend's house last night. sarah was there and i brought hollie along. for some reason sarah left early and hollie was really upset about something. she started crying when we got home but didn't tell me what was wrong. 

early in the morning when hollie was asleep i got a whatsapp voice message from sarah which was 20 minutes long. it was a conversation between sarah and hollie which must have been taken yesterday. it started off ok, but hollie started to speak more unpleasantly for no reason at all. she accused sarah of ''hanging around like a bad smell'' and asked why anyone would choose sarah over her. hollie called sarah ugly and called her family ''scum'' and mocked her job (sarah is an elderly care assistant). she also told her that she'd make sure i'd want nothing to do with sarah. at this point sarah told her that she was recording all of this on her phone and would show it to me. hollie can be heard sobbing and begging her not to save the recording. sarah then said goodbye to her and hollie can be heard shouting ''you f#cking b****!''

after listening to this i was not sure what to do so i pretneded everything was normal. i made hollie breakfast like i always do. she's doing some shopping with her mom so she left in the morning and will be back late. 

i'm not sure what to do. i thought hollie was everything i'd ever wanted. she was perfect. but now i'm fairly sure that everything sarah has accused her of is true. the things she said to sarah on the recording were disgusting and nothing like the nice girl i fell in love with. i haven't spoke to sarah yet, because i'm struggling to find the words to apologise for not believing her. 

i'm not sure if i can continue my relationship with hollie. sarah was my whole world once, and even now i still care deeply for her. to know that my future wife wants - and is actively trying to - get rid of her is frightening. but at the same time i was so sure that hollie was who i was meant to be with and i'm not sure i have it in me to break her heart. 

should i break up with hollie or try to salvage something with her, and how to i go about building bridges with sarah?

"update i 34/m found condom wrappers in our trash can. my wife 34/f and i don't use them and i'm wondering how to approach this.. link to previous thread here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba2nt4/i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash_can_my/).

opinion on whether i should talk to my wife or not was pretty even and quite divisive at times.  ultimately i decided to talk to her for a few reasons.  she wasn't exhibiting any other suspicious behavior that i could tell.  i know her pretty well and i think i can read her reactions to things well too.  and she's my wife, she's been honest and faithful, as far as i can tell, for the 15 years we've been together.  i owe her the benefit of the doubt.  and finally if she was cheating, she was getting away with it, so maybe bringing this up would shake something loose and i'd figure out what was going on.

i brought it up pretty casually.  just ""hey, i found condom wrappers in the trash can outside, any idea where they came from?""  we discussed it pretty calmly.  she didn't have any idea where they came from and suggested some of the same theories that you guys did and that i had thought of myself.  there was no indication she was lying or hiding anything.  she understood why i was concerned and didn't freak out and accuse me of not trusting her.  

so that's pretty much the end of it i guess.  i don't see any further evidence that she's cheating and i'll chalk it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes.  i'll probably be on higher alert for odd behavior for awhile, but that's really all i can do.  sorry it's not the fun drama-filled update you were all hoping for.",8
"i m32 matched with my wife f29 on tinder.... big time throwaway account.

i'll start by saying that my wife and i don't have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

we met on tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. we've been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, i would say.

a month ago she left on a business trip for a week and i found myself downloading tinder on a particularly lonely night. i don't even know why. i didn't have any intentions. but i did it.

i swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. it was a funny reminder of that time of my life. i deleted it and moved on.

on monday my wife left for another business trip. last night i once again downloaded tinder and started swiping. again, i had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

then i saw her picture come up.

i say shocked for a moment. i wondered if i should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. i thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... but i read her profile... it's her. it's her now and it's her live. there's even a picture of her where i am cut out.

i decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

i swiped and we matched.

she gets back from her business trip tomorrow. i'm going to confront her then. i don't even know how this is happening. she's over 100 miles. is a friend of her using her account??

"(update) my husband's m32 ""sabbatical"" has become pathetic and i f30 want it to end right now.. first, thanks to all who responded to my prior post. a lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.



on the day i made my last post, my husband and i had a talk that night when i got home from work. i basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. he repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.



then i moved onto finances. i asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was ""enough"". i pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn't answer. i asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. when i asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.



i told him that the current arrangement wasn't working, and that he'd have to start paying 50% of the bills on march 1st. at this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. he wouldn't even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as i talked. i doubt he even heard a word i said, but i clearly stated all the other issues i had -- the instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc. 



after this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. for almost a week now he's slept in the basement. he basically doesn't leave the basement when i'm home unless it's to get food. honestly, it's pathetic.



i am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. i also have a coffee date planned for sunday with my best friend -- i am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. because honestly, this isn't the life i want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. i am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.



thanks again for reading and giving your input. ",8
"my (21m) girlfriend (22f) got into a wheelchair. don't know if we're compatible anymore.. i know the title is horrible and everyone is going to call me an asshole but this is the truth. she got into a bad accident 3 months ago and is now in a wheelchair, presumably for the rest of her life. she's handling it like a champ. we've cried together a lot, but she's the most positive person i know. always keeps her head up even after this. and i love her immensely, we are highschool sweethearts been together for 5 years. but everything that has happened has made me second guess our relationship. recently i had a talk with someone and she mentioned how tough all this must be for me. honestly i didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all i cared for was my girlfriend. but we kept talking and i ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where i realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. one thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if i was my gf's caregiver. she has help that comes a few times a week, but i help her out whenever i can, though she doesn't always want me to. and if we stay together that's never going to change. i know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair. there's so much in the world we wanted to discover and do together but we can't do it together anymore and it so so breaks my heart. i am really bad at putting my thoughts into words sorry, i just don't really know what to write. i love her to the moon and back. but then i think, what kind of boyfriend am i if breaking up with her even crosses my mind. we were planning to get engaged next year. she's always so happy to see me and knows i've had issues dealing with the accident. she's so selfless it's not even funny. sex hasn't really been working and she herself suggested i get a fwb so i don't get frustrated. but i don't know if that will fix anything and quite frankly, i don't want anybody else but her.

sorry for this mess and i'm not an english speaker. any way this is sort of like a vent but i don't know what to do. i sincerely don't. i know i should talk to her but i don't even know what to say to her, or how.",8
"not sure how to deal with my 37f anti-vaxx husband 35m since i want to get our kids vaccinated. at first i assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  we were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

it's been 6 years. six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

first, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

at 1 year i pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and i decided to take her to the er.  

thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

he said all the things i've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. he explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

i tried to explain that i agree, but i feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes i was respecting up until now.

he ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

on the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

i look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

i won't do this anymore. although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

can i just take them myself?  we always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

what can i say so he won't go? how can i keep this form him, or should i tell him once it's done?

reddit i need encouragement and suggestions what to do. 

please help

edit: for the people who are down voting::

if i was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. help me help my children this is no different. for those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky. i thought he would eventually let them get vaccines but now it's just excuse after excuse.",8

"i am 25 and getting married. dealing with issue around picking my ""maid of honor"" for my wedding. friends women in their 20s think my brother 35/m is a bad choice..   

i am planning my wedding to my awesome fiance and am so excited. we've been planning the event and will be married later in the year. he has his best man (his brother) and groomsmen mostly picked out. i thought i did, too. we each have 6 people and i have 5 female bridesmaids and a ""man of honor"" which i want to be my brother. my bridesmaids think this isn't a great idea and a few are hurt i'm not choosing them instead. here's why i want to choose my brother. 

my biological mother lost custody of me when i was 4 and i was put in an emergency foster situation with a family. i lived with them for 6 months but was then put back into my mother's case. from 4 1/2ish to 6 i lived with my mother and it was bad. she was too sick, too addicted and too weak to handle a child and by 6 i was being adopted out. by some miracle, the family who took me in at 4 got ahold in the system and i went to live with them and was later adopted. the family had boys – the youngest was 16 when i got there. i was terrified of him when i got there, which they told me about recently (i have no recollection of that). i do remember him spending the summer with me, teaching me to swim, teaching me how to play games, teaching me how different appliances worked. he skipped a summer job to help our mom with my adjustment. i had eating problems, i had dental problems, i had a snoot full of health problems – including parasites. he came to doctor appointments, he also helped get me ready for school (i hadn't started kindergarten yet and would actually never go). he and my mom would do learning activities with me and by september i was okay to enter first grade. i used to lay on my stomach and play geography games with him and he'd reward me with riesens. we were very close, he didn't go away to college as is tradition and instead stayed home to go to a good university locally. he'd pick me up from schools some days and from 6 to 12 i had an older brother to rely on. he eventually moved out and went to medical school (he's such a great person for that field). 

very literally my brother helped save my life. i was suicidal as a young kid, and through a lot of changes and help, was able to climb out. he was a calm stable influence in my life. i credit him, my mother and father with saving my life – i would never have gone to college, i probably wouldn't have graduated high school or even lived as i was so sick. i had 4 endoscopies, 4 colonoscopies and 3 surgeries before i was 8. my family doesn't look like me (i'm most likely mexican and something else, most probably african-american) and doesn't come from where i do, but they never treated me any differently than their other kids. since the others were older and out of the home i was never as close to them as i was my parents and brother. 

my thinking is, a maid of honor is someone really important and i cannot think of anyone else who comes close. i haven't even asked him yet but i think he'd do it. i told my parents and they said they wouldn't say anything to him but thought it was a great idea. my husband is also good with it and think it's a sweet thing to do, but my female friends were horrified i suggested it and think it's ""creepy"". if i look back on that time, it's the happiest a person could be. is it weird and creepy? does it contravene some weird relationship boundary between brothers and sisters? is it highly inappropriate?",8
"my 20f boyfriend 27m did something concerning during sex and i'm not sure if he just ""didn't know"", or if it was intentional.... together for one year and we live together. otherwise happy and loving/respectful relationship. this post might be tmi but i don't feel comfortable seeking advice about this irl so i'm asking here how other people would feel about it.

so, we have a good sex life and i have felt happy and satisfied with it. i think he's generous in bed and cares about my own pleasure, i would not describe him as selfish and only caring about himself...until this incident. however, he's been asking me to try anal for a long time. i kept saying no and explaining my reasoning for it, which was that i was scared it would hurt and because it takes way more prep/care than piv sex. 

**here's the tmi part, i apologize**he had never tried it before. he's been fingering me back there during sex and i was okay with that, but a few days ago i was laying on my stomach during sex and he stuck it in my ass without warning or asking. i was a little drunk but knew it felt off and then it just really hurt. i told him it hurt and he said to try and relax. 

i did try to relax but it hurt really bad and i asked him like 3x to pull out before he finally did. at which point he apologized. but afterwards he did it again, and i asked him to stop again and he said to ""wait because he was about to finish"" so i allowed it to happen. i just waited til he came while in some pain and it honestly sucked.

 i'm not gonna say i was raped because i blame myself for the whole thing, but it was painful, not enjoyable, and he thinks it was great. there was no lube or anything so obviously it did not feel good for me. he wasn't rough about it but still wtf? how can you not understand that you can't just stick your dick raw into somebody's ass? it's not like a vagina which gets wet on it's own.**it makes me feel like he knew but didnt care.**

i just feel uncomfortable with the whole situation and i am not sure what to do about it. how should i have this conversation with him? what should i do about it? how would you react?",8
"my sister caused a scene at mother's day brunch because we didn't honor her as a ""cat mom"". hi guys. i am a man, 32m and i have two sisters - carly (38f) and melinda (26f). we went out to a family style restaurant for brunch and just returned home.

melinda and i are happily married, each with three children. my older sister carly never married. she had a fiance that she cheated on and he left her. that was 10 years ago and she hasn't been in a relationships longer a few months ever since. she has 4 indoor cats and also feeds a few stray cats that hand around her neighborhood.

my mom was very ecstatic because in the last year, my younger sister and i both gave her an additional grandchild. so she gave a speech.

in her speech, she thanked us all for coming and said some flowery lovey stuff and then thanked melinda and my wife for both being excellent mothers to her beautiful grandchildren.

upon hearing my mom praise my wife and my younger sister for being mothers, my sister carly butt in rudely with a loud and irked ""achem!""

she then went on a diatribe about how she is a mom just like they are, and why don't we ever wish her a happy mother's day?

i explained calmly that she isn't a mom at which point, she threw a fork at me and raised her voice in the restaurant ""i am a f*cking mom too you d*mn a**holes! just because i don't have human babies doesn't mean i'm not a f*cling mother too!""

my younger sister tried to calm her down but instead, carly just poured her third glass of white wine into a nearby potted plant, spit at the plant (wtf i know right) and then stormed out.

we thought that we be the end of it, but now she has published a manifesto on her social media calling us small minded and disrespectful and went on to explain why she feels that she is a mother. despite never getting pregnant and giving birth.

we have family and friends calling us on the phone since, asking what happened. i don't know what to tell them other than maybe my sister is showing signs of a nervous breakdown?

i tried texting carly to say ""hi"", but my text came back green (which she has an iphone so it's usually blue). does this mean she blocked me?

anyways i would appreciate any help y'all could give here :/",8

"i (f 28) walked in on my step son (8) touching my son (4). i'm so stunned, it hasn't even sunk in.

it was early this morning. my husband was already gone for work, but i went to wake my step son up for school. he and my son slept in the same bed last night, sometimes when my son has nightmares he goes into his brother's room.

i walk in and they are awake, lying down and my stepson is just like playing with him. i can't bring myself to describe in detail. my son was giggling but as soon as he saw me, my step son burst into tears.

he got up and ran into my arms. he kept saying ""i'm sorry, i'm sorry."" i told him it's okay. i didn't know what else to say, i was speechless. he kept pleading with me ""please don't tell daddy"". 

he was so distraught so i didn't have him go to school. all day he's been in his room alone crying. my son is fine, he's been watching cartoons and playing with his toys all morning.

i don't want to tell my husband on the phone, i want to wait till he comes home. but i don't know what to say to him. i'm so worried, i don't think he'll take it well. how do i tell him? what can i do? i know it sounds crazy, but i'm not angry at my step son i'm just sad and confused. i want both my son and him to be okay.",8
"update my (28f) boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) are going on a week-long vacation. they uninvited me.. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/copzwa/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend_29f_are/)

update, as promised.

i was really upset the day i dropped him off and he was texting me but i wasn't responding. i wasn't sure what i wanted to do, but i didn't want to do anything at all in the state i was in. i waited until the next day, and then i sent him a thought out text letting him know that i didn't feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that i would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. he called but didn't leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn't understand.

the rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but i couldn't bring myself to pick up or text back. on thursday, i think that he realized that i was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things — i told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

when he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. i was working all day, but also i still didn't want to respond. he asked me to explain because he didn't understand what was going on. the next day, i sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn't understand why i was throwing away everything that we built. he left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why i was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that i had made up about him to his face.

i wasn't going to respond to him and i wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. so i sat down to write him this letter. it's long, so skip over if you want. i tried to call him but i started crying and told him i'd just send him an email instead. this is what it said.

""the time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. i have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and i see that we should not be together. i am sorry that i have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn't have to change at my or anyone's behest.

from the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who i had never met that either she goes or i go on this trip, and you picked her. you didn't offer to have her meet me (theoretically i was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn't encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn't consult me at all. that's enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. however, i stayed.

this is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. here is what i understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. nothing happened. the other thing i understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. according to what i also understand, it took a long time for 29f's boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after i'm not sure how long. this is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that i was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). you did not tell me this was happening until i asked when the trip to hawaii would be.

you purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which i have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which i repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. there is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. this makes me feel sick to my stomach.

so, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, i tell you that i want to meet this person. on my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend — a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. the first conversation that we have is one in which 29f and her boyfriend argue about how she dm'ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. you tell me about conversations that 29f has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship — stuff about kids and dogs. i have a discussion in which i let you know that i see that and that it worries me. 

meanwhile, i am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. i, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. i want it to work out. but each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. it is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29m, we had only been together for nine months. how long did it take before 29f's boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

we go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our airbnb for copenhagen, we go over it when i tell you that i still feel uncomfortable and i do not feel good about the trip. talk about repeatedly saying something! although i ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. surprisingly, i have no ideas either. 

ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29f will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. you attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. this is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. this upsets me. you do not know what to do. i don't blame you — at this point, it was well out of hand. i don't know what to do either. there is no good solution that i can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. i tell you that either i have to get over it, or i have to break up with you, and that i don't want to break up with you. but my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down. 

she arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. after all of this lead-up, i know that you can tell how unhappy i am. i fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy i am. you leave, and when i don't respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope i'm okay and you're going to bed. no call.

the rest of the week was rough. my text to you was met with, essentially, ""i'm sorry you feel this way."" you tell me that i'm being unfair.

there is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. this is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. this is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29f, i guess.

in the end, all of this is to say that i have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

there have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what i can only assume are personal differences.

i cannot handle your relationship with 29f. and i suppose i could ask you to pick between her and me, but that's not what i want to do. i want you to have your best friend, and i want to leave. i did love you, but i am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that i'm crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

it seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. i am not happy in this, and i do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

there is no need for this to be mutual. i do not need your permission to break up with you.""

he wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that i would not be able to handle their relationship.

he said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

i wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

he agreed and apologized. for me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn't work for me and i don't feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. i stand by my decision at this point.

tldr: we broke up.",8
"i 32m make significantly more money than my new girlfriend 26f and it's causing problems. hi everyone. long time lurker, first time poster. this may just be a problem i'm identifying in my head, and i know you all are good at cutting through bullshit, so hopefully you can help.

i'm an anesthesiologist in washington, d.c. and make over 300k a year. consequently, i live a comfortable life and, while i have a significant amount of medical school debt, am pretty financially stable for the foreseeable future. i'm glad to spend a little more than most would on special dinner, gifts, and things, because i'm pretty much guaranteed this salary for the rest of my career.

my gal works at a nonprofit and makes 55k a year. she's a bit of a penny pincher, happy to spend money on trips and dining out, but budgets religiously and tracks every penny she spends. 

we've been dating for about four months now, and it's going really well. i love spending time with her.

the issue is, i think she's uncomfortable with how much money i make. whenever i take her on a date, i insist on paying for everything. this makes perfect sense to me, because money i spend to take her out is a drop in the ocean, but for her it would probably add up. but she sometimes doesn't let me or doesn't want me to pay. she'll insist on splitting the bill, or if i pay, she'll try and pay the next time we hang out. i've told her time and time again that i'm more than happy to pay for things, spending time with her makes me happy, and so i'd be glad to drop a couple hundred bucks a month on dinners, drinks, movies, etc. but she always insists that ""she can pay her own way"" and ""she doesn't need to be taken care of."" 

one time she had to miss a flight to visit a friend. it was nonrefundable and she was out $300. when she was complaining to me about it, i immediately offered to give her the $300 back, just so she wouldn't feel bad about losing the money, but she rejected me and said she just needed to vent. 

it's not really a problem in the grand scheme of things, i just think it's silly that she spends money on me when i make more in a year what she'll make in five. and like i said, i'm happy to treat her.

any thoughts on how to navigate this? i especially would like to hear from people in relationships with huge income differences. 

tl;dr i make a lot more money that gf, but she won't let me pay for things.",8
"update2: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

tldr: my gf was raped. wanted to abort. talked to mother. decided not to abort. i left her. 

update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

tldr: gf calls me, reveals mum made her not get an abortion because god cares. she wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. some of reddit think i'm a baby killer.


i was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but i thought i should provide an update on some recent events from a mother from the pits of satan's rectum.

on saturday, i answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. they asked me if i was who i was, and i replied i was. they then said they were looking for my gf. i called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

the officers then split, one taking the gf to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

the officer who took me started asking me questions about how long gf had been here. if she had any contact with anyone else. if she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. i answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on gf. i asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

after a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. the moment they left, my gf told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if i had been hurting her. she was also asked if she was being held against her will. she said no to everything, of course. she said that the police received a call from her mother saying she might be in danger, and that i could be abusive her.

i was fucking livid. i immediately said i was going to press charges against her - for what? i dunno. harrassment probably?

my gf begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

wtf? she sent police to my house to get me arrested. how is that sane thinking? i could lose my job if i was arrested and charged. what the hell is she thinking?

i told gf that if the mother does anything like this again, i will definitely press charges. so the gf decides on sunday to talk to the mum to not do anything like this again.

they had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then i start hearing sobs. immediately, i walked into the room, saw my gf was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

i plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as i heard ""hello?"" from the phone. then i put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a mother"" and hung up.

then i held the gf for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

apparently, the mother was telling gf how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the mother again, or her brother, or her deceased father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat gf, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because gf would be going to damnation.

i told gf that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. i love her smile.

what do you think, if anything, should i do about the mother? no doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


response to some people from previous threads and pms after thread was locked:

1 - abortion was never an option. gf was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her mother. and if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - you can believe my gf cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, i suppose.  just fyi, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. cheating...right........

edit: 3 - my gf and i are still going to therapy about all of this.",8
"is it weird that my gf (22f) ""tucks me in"" to bed every night? (21f). we've lived together for over a year now, we just had our two year anniversary, and she's the love of my life, i think she's absolutely brilliant in all sense of the word. 

our schedules are quite opposite, i wake up for work at 6:30am, she sleeps in until 1pm for her night shift. i always go to sleep first, i need more sleep than the average person anyway (about 10 hours a night) and i always have to be up early in the morning. she slips in to bed in the first hours of the morning - sometimes i'm already asleep before she gets back from work, but most of the time i'm just getting ready for bed as she gets home.

i'm not really sure how this came to be in our schedule, but every night that i get in to bed before she does, she comes to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in. i love it, i think it's adorable and i'm kind of a clingy girlfriend so i enjoy it a lot! i'm just wondering if anyone else does this?

recently we had a friend stay over (our place is too small to have many guests stay over so having someone stay the night is rare) and i went to bed early and left them to their netflix, and my girlfriend said she'd come tuck me in soon. i got embarrassed about it, like it's weird or something? i just don't want people to find it strange or gross, i don't know.

is it weird?",8
"my (16m ) gf (17f) is 8 months pregnant with my daughter. is my life actually over?. ok so i'm trying to make the best of a not so good situation. my gf who i've known for basically forever (been official since i was 14) is having my baby. everyone especially my parents keep telling me i fucked up big and my life is over. they say i'm a loser and i'll never get anywhere in life. they say i'll never be happy again. how true is that?

i keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

i'm pretty much freaking out at this point. i have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. obviously i don't want to be a dad but im gonna be. so it is what it is. 

my parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. since i told them she was pregnant they said since i'm making adult decisions i now have adult responsibilities. they make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. i have to buy my own food and anything i need. i have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting i'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. i have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

i desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money i had none. i was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. gfs parents bought me a new pair since i got an infected toenail from being squished. i don't want to owe them too, jc.

anyway. i'm leaving home once school is done in june. gf's parents said i won't have to pay them rent as long as i help with the baby and contribute with that.

my parents say they'll sue me for the money i owe them. can they? when i get mad they just say i'm an adult and i get adult consequences now.

so ya. this got a bit derailed. am i doomed?",8
"my best friend stopped me from killing myself, but has no idea. i have suffered from depression for a while now, and have had thoughts of ending it. but a few days ago, i decided i was going to do it.

i was on my break at work (i'm a cleaner) and i just decided that i was going to go to my cart, take the toilet cleaner from inside, go to the nearest cupboard and drink the whole bottle.

i got out my pen and paper and started to write my note. but, then i got a text from my best friend.

she was just texting to ask how my day was going. she knows i suffer from depression and wanted to make sure i was ok. it's like she knew what i was going to do, even though she had no idea.

and just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. it's like it just melted away. i realised that i can't kill myself, because i know that she would blame herself. she's that kind of person.

she saved my life, and had absolutely no idea that she did. i really want to thank her for it, but i'm kind of afraid to tell her because i don't want to upset her. i want to tell her how much her friendship means to me. how much i love her for it.

i'm so torn on whether or not i should tell her.",8
"i (25 f) just found out my husband's (38 m) latest affair is a 19 year old girl.. so maybe i don't need to worry about divorcing him after all, maybe she is wife #3 for him. 

he told me about her last night. he was home late and slightly drunk. but he knew what he was saying. i know he said it to hurt me. and it did even though i know hes been cheating before. 

now i just need to plan my exit. i think my chances of finding another boyfriend or husband are slim to none  (i have no hair or breasts anymore from my cancer) but at least i will have my kids. 

encouragement would be appreciated.",8
"should i (23f) tell my boyfriend (26m) about the egg?. pretty short and sweet. together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. he admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. this guy's pretty good! up until then i hadn't seen any. but i just spotted the giant one. i really didn't mean to, i haven't been trying to look for them. 

should i tell him so he can re-hide it? or do i take it tomorrow?

edit: i forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because i was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

edit update: he came to the room and i said ""what if i told you i found the giant egg?"". he laughed and told me ""well, i got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" i jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help i will."" 

i am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! will update then :)

mini update: doing my morning routine. so left for church with his family while i get ready to go and clean a gentleman's house and answer some of the reddit comments! one of the eggs was in my coffee pot. i guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! i'm so touched, honestly. it kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! will be back later once we're both home and i can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

update: firstly, a couple people i think asked so here are the eggs in question(http://imgur.com/a/lw1xoy3). the reese's thing is more of a basket, but i won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. on the shelf i could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's reese's for me in the ""egg"" xd. if you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; i took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) and ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. as for the last one, both of us swear i found it, but i must have dropped it somewhere? under the couch or something. idk. in the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

for everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. but, i mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way i've got it planned much better."". which isn't much news to me, as i've said we've discussed marriage at length (i even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). all i've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to do it.  i mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so i'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. searching for the eggs was very fun!! i needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg i needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand i was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

and no, i don't think i missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. i think i really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! i'll put slips of paper in each egg i hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things i love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) so, that's all folks. no proposal, but a very happy easter on both ends! thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. and to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; i've been there too. if you go through my posting history you'll actually find that so and i went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. it took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

tldr; boyfriend hid eggs. i found eggs. reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their so, easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",8
"my aunt is taking me to court after my mother's suicide and has accused me of ""killing my mother"". a few months ago my mother killed herself. i (22m) am her only son. my parents are divorced, and i had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that i was living in asia teaching english. i promised my mother that i would visit her when i returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before i came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. my mother told me i should visit my father first because of this.

i should also add, that at this time and the past few years, i was very, very depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. i really wanted to be at my home where i felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. when i got home, my grandfather passed away on the day i arrived, and i was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so i stayed with my father for a few weeks.

later, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. i debated visiting her at that time, but i wasn't sure i would be feeling well enough to travel again. my grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but i told her i would have to think about if i can come then. eventually i decided that i would visit them at the same time as my mother.

the night i arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. that night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. i was driving home from the airport at that time. i remember that night so vividly as i could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  my aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. i noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. they seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.

after about a week i returned to my father's home and stayed there. i was an emotional mess for the following month. i had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. eventually i began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that ""this is my fault"" and ""you killed your mother."" i was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. they accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. they even insulted my father. relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but i have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. i know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area.

today i received an email from my aunt that told me that i would have to go to court. it simply stated that i should call this lawyer. i am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. it's so difficult for me to think clearly, and i can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. any advice would be appreciated. i feel like i missed a lot of details, so feel free to ask me questions if need be.

&#x200b;

edit: i should clarify, that i don't know the actual legal accusation. she accused me of those horrible things while on the phone.

edit 2:  one comment mentioned it, but i just want to say that i don't believe they are after money. they genuinely believe i am a horrible person, and a horrible son, so they wish to hurt me.

edit 3: thank you for all the responses! i have read all of them, and they gave me a lot of confidence to keep moving forward. i did take the advice to post on r/legaladvice. so i'll update everyone (hopefully soon) to how this situation unfolds. thanks again!",8
"updatei 59m cut two of my kids 24f28m out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. how should i fix this situation?. **edit: guys, i understand how petulant my daughter is behaving, but please refrain from using profanities. she's still my daughter and i'd rather not read that stuff. you can criticise her behaviour without cussing :)**

original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/)

so i took the advice of the previous thread, which was overwhelmingly to consider setting up a trust for my two problem children.

before i even invited the two of them over to talk the issue over, my son called me to apologise for how he was acting. he seemed genuinely ashamed of the things he said and admitted that it was wrong of him to waste his mother's savings like that.

anyway, i invited the two of them over to tell them my plans. as i say, my son seemed very apologetic, while my daughter was clearly still upset with me.

i told them that i would reinstate their inheritance, but since they've demonstrated extremely poor money management that i will only do so through a trust. that i'd talk with a proper lawyer/financial expert on setting them up, and they'd be designed to provide for them and any future children they have over many years after i'm gone. that them blowing through it in a few years is simply not an option.

son took the news very well and said he wouldn't trust himself with that money anyway. i'm not sure what caused such a sudden change of heart in my son, but as i say it **seemed** genuine. he also offered to go to therapy for his sex/drug addiction if i helped pay, to which i agreed (i'll make sure this therapist actually exists, don't worry). 

my daughter did not take it well, christ. far worse than i expected. here i am willing to give them a second chance, and she just blows up about how it's not fair that it's only them that don't get the money outright. i explained that their siblings had demonstrated they were responsible with money and hence why i would leave it to them outright. nope, not good enough for her. she doubled down that spending all of her mother's 300k+ gbp on travel was justified. had the gall to again call me several extremely upsetting names and accuse me of being emotionally abusive.

so i told my daughter that as i'm retiring soon, perhaps i should experience the joys of travel also. perhaps i should spend ""her"" inheritance that i've worked for my entire life on travel myself. she stormed out and hasn't contacted me since.

really proud of how my son's taken the news. extremely disappointed in my daughter.

genuinely considering spending ""her"" part of the inheritance on travel myself at this point.",8
"my wife (29f) is encouraging me (31m) to have an affair?. wife and i have been married for 5 years. i think we have a good relationship and a great sex life. i think she thought the same. however, following a 5-day yoga retreat with a few of her work friends while i was at a conference late last year her opinion seems to have soured.

apparently ""fernando and sarah"" have everything we have, and more, because... they're swingers! when he has sex with another woman he uses it as a learning experience to take home to his doting wife (who also bones around) and they have even more mind-blowing drug-fuelled experiences with each other while the kids are staying with grandma... or atleast that's what i'm getting from it.

so i told her flatly that i don't want to have sex with anyone else and am happy with her; and she quickly states the feeling is mutual. case closed i thought, but then she comes back with more reasons the next week ""it gives independece and freedom to the relationship.""

i'm thinking maybe this is a bit of a mid-life crisis thing and made it clear i'm just not really into banging other people because it feels too much like cheating, but she's insistent! she keeps going on and on about her work friend fernando talking about how mindblowing the experience has been for him and how we really need to try it.

so at this point i'm thinking: are you wanting to cheat on me? she's entirely focussed on me going out and having sex with someone else, but i'm sitting here thinking ""what's in it for her?"" it's concerning.

straw that broke the camel's back is today she came home with a picture of ""fernando's sarah"" and a hint that she's down to hook up with me at their place... i'm like... lost for words right now. how do i make it clear i don't want to ahve sex with someone else and i believe in monogamous relationships.

we have 2 kids.",8
"am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?. context. happened a few days ago. me and my boyfriend were staying in a hotel with his friend and his wife (we've been together 3 years). we were all drinking and after awhile his friend and wife left. me and my boyfriend had drunk sex and then went to bed.

after awhile his friend came back alone. my boyfriend got up which woke me up. i was half asleep, and heard the friend say something about my body. my boyfriend asked if he wanted to see. i was on my side away from them and heard them walking over. i panicked and didn't know what to do. was i suppose to jump up and let them know i was listening? freak out? (i have sever anxiety so this caused an attack). i froze and he lifted up the covers i was under. edit: i was naked 

i confronted him the next day but he says i wanted him to see me because i didn't stop him and he should be upset at me but is understanding and i should be too so we can let it go.

am i an asshole? can i not be upset because i didn't stop it?

update: thanks everyone so much for support/ advice. i've been with this guy forever and we were talking about starting to do foster care and marriage. i thought i was crazy and this wasn't as big a deal as i was making it since i wasn't touched or anything. i'd like to make an update after i talk with him again. when you make one do you just add it in here or make a new post? im new to this.

to everyone saying it's ultimately my fault for not doing anything, mental illness is paralyzing. i was sexual abused as a kid and this was the same way my body made me (or wouldn't let me) react. i wasn't sure at first but i know i didn't do anything wrong. 

i'm sorry if it seemed like an obvious answer. it's hard to accept these things when it's someone you had a future with.

more info: i am hesitant to tell the friends wife because they have a baby together. i know she should know the kind of man he is but it makes me think of how i went through divorce but then again would he be a good father to the baby girl anyway?

"update 1 year later- i 28f gave my boyfriend 28m an engagement ultimatum and i might be regretting it. original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: my boyfriend and i have been together for 4.5 years, moved to a new city together, and live together, but i had not been able to get him to have a serious discussion about where the relationship is going/whether he sees us getting married (i've known that i want to marry him for about 2 years, so i've been trying to bring up the topic for about that long). i was getting frustrated, (i would like to have kids, and my time to do so is limited) so i told him in september that we needed to be engaged by 3/31/18 (when our lease expired) or i was going to move out.

&#x200b;

update #1 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/861lrl/update\_i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: written 10 days prior to the ultimatum deadline, my boyfriend said he wasn't planning to propose. his asked me to stay with him and assured me that he would propose in december 2018 if i visited his family in their home in september and he spoke with them about his plan to propose to me. his reasoning was that i had to visit his family in their home before he felt comfortable taking the next step (i had spent time with his parents in the past, so this didn't make sense to me). i was frustrated but planning to stick to my guns.

&#x200b;

now, on to the current update:

***march 2018***: i couldn't go through with the ultimatum. i was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. but when push came to shove, i couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. i decided that i loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that i had created. i also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in december. i felt i was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because i wouldn't wait another few months. as a compromise, he said we could get a cat (i had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. on 3/31, the day i was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

&#x200b;

***april-september 2018***: my boyfriend and i spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. we both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. i got a therapist and started working on myself. i picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. i think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. i'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. by the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. he also complaints about our cat constantly.

&#x200b;

***september 2018- visiting his family***: as i promised him, i went to visit his parents in their home in september. as i mentioned in the previous post, he is chinese-american (and i'm white), so i studied up on my basic chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. it was a great trip, and i genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. i left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). i asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in december would be ""too fast."" that seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. he also told me i needed to learn chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect english but prefer chinese when they are with family), so i started doing rosetta stone.

&#x200b;

***october-december 2018***: around november, i started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. he was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. for instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by december because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). another time, he freaked out that i have student loans (most people in my profession do, and i have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. luckily i already have this spreadsheet, which i showed him, and he calmed down.

in the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because i was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. i worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. i also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- i stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as i had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). we spent christmas together for the first time this year, and i really thought he would propose then. but he didn't, and i didn't bring it up or pout about it. he visited his family for new years and i was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

&#x200b;

***january 2019:*** i accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. i was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and i tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. i was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. it's now to the point that i equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that i shouldn't have. i realize i've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. but a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. first, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if i stay onboard long term. however, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (i am actually okay with it for the most part). he also has given a hard no to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). i started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

then, this weekend i went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. also, i want to have kids, that's the main reason i am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). so yesterday, i was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and i had this ""aha!"" moment where i realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. there's no shame in having my own wants. and at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (no marriage, we can't stay in the city where i have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but i've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with his desires. so i'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

&#x200b;

i'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. also i am willing to hear all the ""i told you so'"" from everyone who said i needed to leave this guy in march when i said i would. i totally deserve it. thanks for reading!

&#x200b;

***update***: wow, thank you reddit for the super thoughtful replies! i read each one (so far)! 

i spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. i started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. he brought up the fact that it's moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. that we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that i want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes i make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. he worries about  the fact that i get a lot of amazon packages and he doesn't know what i am buying (showed him my amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). also this is all on my credit card (which i comfortably pay off each month) so i don't think i need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. he also doesn't like that i'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). also, since it came up a lot in the comments, i wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we're an interracial couple. 

however, after all this, he said he's not ready for marriage. i was pretty pissed and told him i wished he told me this a year ago so i could have moved on. he basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. so i told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. he's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but i'm remaining gently firm here.",8
"girlfriend (20f) and her friend (20f) 'tested' to see if i (20m) i would cheat.. errr i really don't know how to feel. though i'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. my gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so i did. she wasn't there yet, but her friend was. we chatted for a while and she started being playful, but i brushed it off. playful turned into flirting and i felt super awkward. before i got up she kissed me and i left right after that and called my gf. i explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. i couldn't believe it tbh, i thought she was joking at first. first she was mad that i 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much i could do. and i don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? i've never heard of someone setting up their so and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

the other night after sex, as my husband and i were getting up and dressed, i asked if he could grab me a glass of ice water. he was on his way out of the room, and said sure. he wasn't mad about it, and sex was fine. we weren't fighting and had been having a pretty good week. 

as i walk into the kitchen he hands me the glass of water. 

i don't know what came over me, but i got this sixth sense, i don't know how else to describe it. maybe it was his shiteating grin, but i flat out asked him, did you put your dick in this?

he looked shocked and taken aback by my question and for a split second i thought maybe i was being an idiot. 

he then says, how did you know?!?!

i was furious but it was such a strange situation so i just dumped it out and brushed it off. i didn't know what else to do. 

the next day i asked him about it, and i asked why he did it. he said, i don't know.  

i told him that it kind of made me upset, like i can't trust him to get me a glass of water. it hurt my feelings. he immediately got defensive. 

we got into a fight about trust and he didn't understand what the big deal was. i said, so what? do you put my toothbrush in the toilet when we fight??

he said no of course not, but he had that same shiteating grin. 

i don't know if he'd ever do that, and maybe it was just the way i phrased it or that the fight was about him putting his dick in my glass of water. but, like wtf?

i don't know what to think. 

am i overreacting?

edit:

for those asking, we've been married almost 10 years now. he's 34, i'm 32. 

honestly i didn't expect for this to blow up. i wrote a quick post and went to bed.

thank you to everyone responding/giving advice and input, i'm trying to respond to as much as i can. 

here's my takeaway: 

some people, mostly men, are saying it was just a practical joke or a prank.

but here's the thing, he didn't mean for me to find out. i asked him straight up and he told that he wasn't going to say anything. no harm done! that he thought it was funny and that he didn't know why he did it. he just did. 

so to me, it wasn't done in a joking manner. 

after thinking about it, it's more of a consent issue. to those asking, sure we just had sex and yes i suck his dick sometimes...but this is different. he violated boundaries and i feel upset about that.

update:

whether we can all agree to disagree about it being a joke or not, it was disgusting, disrespectful and crossed a line.

i'm going to talk to him later about boundaries and what not.",8
"my husband (42 m) got his girlfriend (24 f) pregnant. i (38 f) have been sick for 8 years with cancer. you could say i lost my looks. so i understand why it happened.. this is a new username because my daughter knows my other account. 

anyway, i'm not sure how to tell our kids (18, 16, 14, 13, 10) that they are going to have a half sibling. 

before you are harsh about my husband's infidelity i should explain our situation. in the 8 years i've been sick we've had separate bedrooms and very occasional sex. i didn't know for sure he had a mistress but i assumed. my own parents had a similar marriage. 

i just do not know what to do in this situation. he has no plans to leave me to marry her but he asked if i would help tell the kids. 

advice would be greatly appreciated.",8

"today i (18m) found out my best friend (18f) knows i'm in love with her. update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bc5zgd/update\_today\_i\_18m\_found\_out\_my\_best\_friend\_18f/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc5zgd/update_today_i_18m_found_out_my_best_friend_18f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

i have no idea how to format sorry

so today me and a couple of my friends including my best friend were having a casual chat. some time passed and we decided to play some ""game"" where we tell one of the person's secrets that they think we don't know. so it starts with some small things but gradually we all start telling more and more deeper secrets. and just like that, out of nowhere, she says how she knows i've never had a gf because i'm in love with her and don't want other girls (which is very true). i tried laughing it off, and saying how she's crazy, but she insisted that she knows and that i can't lie to her. at that point i think my face turned white and i legit had no idea what to even do or say.

i was sure my behaviour towards her was not in any way indicative of the fact that im in love with her, but somehow sheknows. i also never told anyone about it before telling you right now, so i can't say someone ratted me out. she said that it was the way i looked at her. i never planned on telling her because she's in a relationship for over 2 years now and i know there's not even a chance. but now that i know she knows, what do i do? edit: update tmrw after i have a talk with her.",8
"should i (24m) leave my gf (24f) over her weight?. hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and i love her to bits. she is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200b;

she has gained alot of weight and is now obese. i have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and i know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200b;

it doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, i have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. lets go for a run, same thing. have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. i  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, i found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. she also lies about what she eats.

&#x200b;

theres an excuse for everything. when i think of my future, i think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. when i think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because i dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200b;

you can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. when she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now i dont even recognise her. if you have any advice or comments i will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200b;

edit: i went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. im glad people understand where im coming from. i thought most people will be angry that i dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which i just have to say you are dillusional!.

i am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, i wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. i feel like the word therapist scares some people. also whenever i see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. alot of people mentioned sports too, i could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. i wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind i will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. if i dont see any improvment then i know there is no hope and will leave her. thanks again you lovely people, i will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200b;

another edit: i cannot reply to all your comments but i have read most of them! some of your stories have been great to read. a quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. she took it really well. to all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, i dont know because she would never tell me her weight. i really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but i shall know in a few months. i will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too.",8
"my roommate's(21f) parents keep letting themselves into my (21 f) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.. tldr: my roommate's mom keeps coming into my apartment 

backround: my parent's are family friends with my roommate's parents. i was never really friends with my roommate in high school, but got to know her from living with her in a dorm. recently, my parents got me an apartment and pay  rent every month. so pretty much, roommate's parent's don't pay 

over the past few months when we come home from class,  we have walked in on
1. her mom doing our laundry almost every week. 
2. her mom cooking food and cleaning for us 
3. her mom cleaning my fucking closet and calling me a slut for having tube tops and mini skirts, etc
5. her mom and dad chillin at the apartment friday nights to make sure we don't party. 

i just can't deal anymore. i told my roommate to tell them to stop, but she said i'm overreacting. am i overreacting? should i tell my parents?

i have lost my mind. literally. udhdudbdu helpppp.

edit 2: imma tell my parents about it. i just didn't want to ruin their friendship as they were close friends for a lonnggggg time.

mini update: i took out edit 1 to shorten the post. i told my older brother about what happened, emailed my building manager, and was able to get a response from him saying i can put a lock on my bedroom door. me and my brother went to home depot and got a basic lock. her mom is currently cooking in the kitchen and watching my brother fix the lock. she doesn't look too happy. i'll update you all again when i tell my parents.

edit: sorry for all the edits but i think i need to clarify something. the reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. he said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

"update - my (21m) girlfriend (22f) got into a wheelchair. don't know if we're compatible anymore. first off, wow. apparently my thread blew up after i went to sleep. i didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. i was  so embarrassed and mortified. she had already read the whole thing and my comments. i honestly didn't know what to say i could only say i was so sorry and that i didn't want her to find out like this. she was calm.. told me it was okay, said it touched her.. can't really describe how i felt. we just held each other for a very long time. might be weird but i knew i needed to be with her when she found out. i started thinking about a life without her, and i simply couldnt. i can't give up on this girl. we've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. i have apologized over and over.. she's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. a person this special i won't find again, but i hate myself for having thought about breaking up. she's still the same person. i should have communicated my feelings to her. i'm a very lucky guy. i really do love her to the moon and back. 

regarding therapy, i have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. y'all were right. can't hurt to give it a try, maybe i was unlucky with my former therapists. but i already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. and the girl who i talked to i've cut off completely. my gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. didn't realize she was into me. we're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. i was lost but i know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. i'm with her till the end. we're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. we're doing very well now. she knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. hope everyone here has a great day. thanks.

"i (30f) have just been diagnosed with an illness and am struggling to forgive my husband (39m) for not believing me.. we have been together for 5 years, throughout those 5 years (and about 3 years before i met him) i have had numerous medical issues that i have had to deal with. nothing life threatening but certainly life affecting.

sporadically occurring symptoms have included chronic muscle and joint pain to the point i struggled to get out of bed, skin infections, serious fatigue, hair loss and frequent cold/flu like viruses. 

at first he was really understanding, would comfort me and sympathise with how doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong but for the last year and a half he has started suggesting it's in my head or i'm exaggerating the symptoms.  this hurt so badly because doctors for that last several years have basically said the same thing. i was prescribed pain killers, told i was 'just' depressed and given ad's, or just straight up dismissed. so i stopped bothering. 

then about two months ago i had to go get a script filled and she was so lovely that i started talking about some of this stuff. she ordered a bunch of tests and through intensive questioning and reviewing of my medical history i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. 

thankfully it's something that with appropriate medical care and treatment it can be managed and i'm now starting to feel better. my husband has profusely apologised and has been really supportive but i still feel hurt and kind of betrayed that he didn't believe that i knew there was something wrong. he saw the pain i was in but believed i was putting it on.

we've spoken about it but it still hurts, i don't know how to move on.",8

so, i tried it. i thought that maybe i was being too close minded and so i went for it. it went fine, but it still really isnt my thing. but here's the bad part.

she didnt like it at all. even though we were slow, used condom and lube, she said it was uncomfortable. this would be fine, and something that we could move on from, but she is blaming me. she says that i sabotaged it because i didnt want to do it. but i didnt. i did it exactly how she asked me to, in terms of speed, how hard i went, plus the amount of lube used. she was really the director here. but somehow it's my fault she didnt like it.

im pretty livid about this. i went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. and i feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault. it feels like she built this up in her head too much, and since it didnt live up to it she assumes i ruined it on purpose. we had a fight over this and we broke up. thanks for the advice to those who participated in the last post.",8
"i (22 f) got left at the alter a week ago yesterday. now my ex fiance (26 m) wants to to apologize in person.. he says he is gay and in love with his best friend. i had no clue whatsoever. 

he waited until our wedding day to leave me a note in my hotel room that contained this information. 

i am sad, angry, and confused. 

i wish he had told me long before the day of the ceremony and spared me the extreme pity and humiliation i went through that day. 

now he wants to meet in person to apologize and say goodbye.

"my (21f) boyfriend (22m) said he wouldn't want to date me if i had slept with as many people as him.. i'm not to sure how this was brought up but last night we were laying in bed when he said that if i had had slept with as many people as him (roughly 30) then he wouldn't have wanted to date me. he also said that it's a turn off that i slept with him on the first date and he's surprised that he like me because of this. 

he said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

i find this logic very sexist and full of double standard. i'm super pissed and not sure how to handle it.

edit: for those of you judging the amount of partner he has had in the past, your view is just as bad as his.

update/edit?: this really got a lot more attention then i was expecting and he has now also seen this post.  i really appreciate everyone's advice but i dont think am ready to make a rash decision just yet (much to the annoyance of most people on this thread). i've taken on bored some of the advice being said and think that i need to sit down and have proper conversations with him before i decide if i should continue this or not. i think i should hear him out when i have calmed down a bit and am less angry to give him a chance to explain his point of view.",8
"how do i (34m) break up with my long time depressed dependent girlfriend (34f) that has no life skills?. genders are actually reversed, he knows i've been browsing this sub lately and i'd prefer it if he didn't find this.

i'm ready to break up with my boyfriend of 16 years, but am not sure how. he has suffered from depression all his life, and suicide isn't new to his family. he never graduated high school, doesn't have a license, and has no job experience other than a minimum wage job his mom got for him in his early 20s that lasted a couple years... that was over 10 years ago. it's clear to me he is not interested in those things, even for us. none of his family or close friends are particularly well off or in a position to support him. 

i feel like a bad person, but i don't see a future together that i want. i just wish i'd come to this realization sooner.

we have no kids, only 3 cats. we're not married, and everything is in my name (house, car, bills, etc). only thing i can think of is he's on the bank account, but i doubt he'd have the ambition or means to do anything with it. i'd probably give him half our money (about 5k), and maybe something for the house... we've paid off about 40k of it. or technically, i have.

he's finally started seeing someone for his depression the last few months, and i worry ending things will mean he'll stop that too. i still care very much for him, but i can't keep supporting him and our relationship has been very strained this past year. 

how do i break up? i don't want to completely abandon him and take everything, i want him to have the opportunity for getting the help he needs.

update : i told him i wanted to break up. said this wasn't the life i wanted, and that i gave his sister a heads up and she's available if he wants to talk. i'd like to sort out logistics later, and we can use our couples session this thurs to work on any sticking points.

then left the house. he wants to know why now, why can't i give him a chance to work on it, why can't we work through this, etc. i had to leave, or i'm going to start saying things i regret or break down. not sure when to go back, but hey its pokemon go community day so i won't be bored (what can i say, i'm an optimist and this is me looking for the bright side)

i'm feeling a bit heartbroken right now, but thank you for all the support and encouragement, it's been really helpful to me.

update #2 : sorry for calling you fuckwads for upvoting, it was meant to be a joke. i lovingly call my friends that because the word is funny, and meant it similarly here.

i didn't expect this post to be so popular, or hit the front page. i had planned to delete it, but seeing all the advice and hearing so many people with similar stories, i'm going to leave it up. its not that i'm ashamed or trying to hide anything i wrote, its just i know this post would hurt him. i knew the risk posting online and title is different enough he may not even click if he sees it (we're 33, and he's not interested in relationship drama posts). i'll try to post other updates too. i appreciate all the encouragement,  it means a lot to me and helps keep me strong in my decision. sorry if i don't have time to reply to everyone.

and if my boyfriend or family/friends find this, i'm sorry. i don't want to hurt anyone with this post, but this is me reaching out for emotional support from internet strangers because there's nobody close i can talk to and get emotional support from that isn't also close to him, or wouldn't be biased towards our relationship. i'd rather you didn't read this.

update #3 : he's gone to stay with someone, asked me not to touch his stuff. no logistics have been discussed except it sounds like i won't see him for a bit. i've cried a lot, but am feeling lighter for it. have been messaging a couple people from family and shared friends a bit. they all heard from him first, except his sister who i gave a heads up to (with no details). it's hard at the moment, feeling they're all on his side and hearing their thoughts about it. but i wouldn't have it any other way. i want these people to be there for him when i'm not, he doesn't make friends easily.

i'm not sure i should keep airing personal drama on the internet to strangers, but it is helping me right now. gives me people to talk to, and encouragement. not sure how healthy it is in the long run, so someone tell me if it isn't good for me.

i'm tired and think i can sleep now, been a restless past few nights as i sorted this all out. will try to respond to questions later.

update #4 : i really appreciate all the support, it's more than i can read at once, but means there's always new things to read when i need it. and i've needed a lot of it.

he's back and staying in a separate room for now. this is his home too, i'm not going to force him out the first night when i've already ruined his life. i planned to keep my distance, but i'm not the kind of person that can ignore my best friend of 16 years when he really needs someone, so yes i sat with him through a rough patch tonight and we talked a bit afterwards. he knows he fucked up. i'm firm in my decision that this separation is happening though, and told him i want it done by the end of the month. if he's serious about wanting to change, he needs to do it elsewhere for himself, not here or for me.

also i'm seeing a lot of questions about if i'd take him back if he truly changed to be the man i needed. i don't know. i'm not ready for any new relationship anytime soon, but if he thinks he can sort his life out, i'd give him a second chance date to see what changed when i'm ready to go looking again. i know the chance is slim and theres no guarantees, but he could show me the new him and we'd talk. he's been my best friend for 16 years, and i still care a lot about him and think he is an amazing guy. we grew up together and been through a lot. i don't regret most of it, it's just that people change, and i changed. i'm the one that was ok with this living arangement for so long, and i'm the one that changed to realize i was not ok with it anymore too.

and to be clear, this isn't about him not having a job, or suffering from depression, or any one thing. maybe for some it is, but that's not who i am. i want a partner in life, and it's not a partnership when one person starts to feel they have all the burden of deciding where life is going and working towards those goals, and the other is argumentative and resentful when asked to help both with deciding life goals and working towards them. and is not supportive when their partner goes through a change and is reaching out to find the new normal. this has been our last year primarily,  the previous 15 were mostly good as we stumbled through life together. i want someone at my side in life who will make and work towards our shared goals, not somone i have to fight and drag along.

thank you for all the stories and support, they have really helped me both in coping and in staying firm in my decision. i'll probably stop updating this post, it's getting pretty long. maybe i'll start a new one once things are more finalized.

update #5 : it's been over a day, and harder than i thought. i thought my tears would be done by now. the optimist in me keeps looking for the path back, the one where he becomes the person i need. i miss and love him so much. but i've made my decision and now it's time for both of us to move on, in our own ways. the support here keeps me going, i can't tell you all how much i appreciate it. it's going to be a rough few weeks, but i can do this.  i keep rereading comments, and reminding myself to look to the future, not the past.

like it or not, internet strangers are my coping mechanism. i feel like this post is my diary now, is that allowed?

the lack of support for me has been hard. only his mom has asked how i've been, and wanted my side. i think she understands. we were private people, only had his mom, his 2 sisters, and his childhood friend + his wife. i knew it would be like this, wanted it this way even. i'm not close with my family, but have reached out to my sister to talk. but i still find it easier to talk to internet strangers than people i know. maybe i'll ask my therapist if he knows why that is.

he's i think out of the house for good now. not sure, but i told him either he goes, or i find a temp apartment this week. he left while i was sleeping and hasn't been back. i haven't tried to find out where, but knowing the guy he is, he left for me. he's a good guy, i wish i had said a better goodbye. given him that goodbye hug he wanted last night when he broke down and faced reality. i know it's better this way, i can't be the one there for him now. it hurts, but i know it's for the best

update #5 : it's the end of the third day, and i didn't have any big emotional breakdown today. i consider that progress. some smaller tearful events, but no breakdowns. each time it happens, i try to identify the cause. usually it's loneliness, or thinking of how much hurt i've caused someone. it's hard not to miss him, but i feel a lightness about being free. and i'm still firm in my knowledge that it's the right thing to do. bank accounts are separated, accounts rearranged, legal stuff like insurance taken care of, and my stove is cleaner than it's ever been. i'm still doing baby steps, one thing at a time. i have a therapy appointment tomorrow to talk to someone, and we have a couples appointment thursday to start talking about splitting up assets.

i've barely seen or talked to him since i broke it off. i don't want to push about splitting up assets, or what to do with his stuff just yet. i said he'd have a month to finish everything, and figured we could talk about it thursday. i really need him to take his cat though, she's heartbreaking to look at. misses him so much, not eating much. she's 20lbs, and loves food. he stopped for a change of clothes yesterday, and she sat in the kitchen watching the door for a while, waiting for him to return rather than eating her food that i just gave her. i try to show her extra love, but i can tell she misses him. and he probably misses her.

i've taken to writing a lot, either to other redditors that reached out to offer support, or just re-reading and replying to comments here. and writing in a private diary document. it's very therapeutic to write it out and be able to go back to re-read reasons for everything. for example, if i start thinking maybe i could have tried another ultimatum, i can just go back and re-read what happened the first time i gave one. or if i get to feeling i could have tried harder, i can go back and read all the things i did try over the past year. writing it out and talking to others really does help.

"caught my girlfriend (24f) masturbating and she started crying. my girlfriend and i have a good sense of humor, we like to play around and everything. so she caught me jerking off like a month ago, she thought it was hilarious and kept teasing me about it and asking me what i was thinking about and all that stuff. it's fine, it was embarrassing for 5 minutes but she wasn't mad or weirded out so that helped. i asked her if she masturbated and she said she never did and that she didn't need to and she didn't like it.

last week, i came home a bit early unexpectedly and she was in our bed giving herself an interesting massage. i heard her before i saw her so i came in and surprised her and i was teasing her a bit since she said she never did it and she just started crying and told me to leave. obviously i felt like shit and apologized but she still made me go. i came back home a couple hours later and she was still upset. to this day, she is still upset. i didn't mention it again, but she's acting different. she just seems sulky and withdrawn and not interested in sex. i don't know how to bring it up without making her cry again. i had no idea she was gonna react like that, she was making fun of me for weeks, i thought she could take a joke 

and i feel dumb for not knowing that she masturbated earlier on, we've been together for 4 years and i just found out. i guess she's really good at hiding secrets

edit: holy shit",8
"wife asking me to get circumcised - advice?. hi guys!

my wife and i have been married 2 years, 4 together total.

i grew up in europe and circumcision is extremely rare there. apparently it is much more common in the us.

all her past bf were circumcised and she says she prefers it that way.

she stopped giving my oral sex once we got married and she says it's because she doesn't like doing it for me because of how i am not snipped.

she also calls it anteater penis and makes increasingly disgusted faces when we have sex.

i am willing to do this in order to make her happy but i just want to know you're all thoughts about this.

tl;dr: wife doesn't like my ""anteater"" dick as she calls it so she wants me to get circumcised.

**thank you /u/kiringiraffe - your testimony sealed the deal for me. i will not be doing it!**",8
"i'm a bitch to my husband when he wakes me up. my husband and i have been married for 5 years. we have three boys, ages 4, 2, and 6 months. it's no secret that i am cranky when i am tired, and especially when i'm awakened from sleeping. we joke about it a lot, but this morning he was really upset with me...

last night, i went to bed at 10. he stayed up, which was fine. he even took the baby downstairs with him so i could get some better quality rest. all good. 

just after midnight, he came to bed with the baby. (baby sleeps in our room.) i don't remember any of this, but he says he put the baby down and went to brush his teeth. baby started crying. i got out of bed, flung open the bathroom door, said ""get this baby out of here, you woke me up!"" and went back to sleep. 

this morning i woke up at 630 when our second son woke up. i noticed my husband was not in bed, and our baby was not in the room, either. feeling very well rested, i told my husband i felt great, and asked if he slept downstairs. he said yes. i asked why, and he told me i yelled at him and he didn't want to deal with it. 

i remembered none of this. once he told me the details, i have a vague recollection of what happened. 

i feel really guilty about this.  simply telling myself to be more conscientious doesn't seem to be working. how do i change this behavior?

edit: thank you all so much for all the posts and advice. when hubby got home, i gave him a big hug and told him i was really sorry.  i told him i really wanted to work on it, and read the list of ideas that you guys helped me generate; thank you so much. we had dinner, i put the older two to bed; he took the baby. after the boys were down, i planned to continue the convo (and see where the one-on-one time leads us), but he is sound asleep with the baby!  i'm going to let him get that much-needed rest. will do some research online and see what kind of help there is available for me. thanks again.",8
"i m26 recently found out my ""step-father"" m48 who just married my mother 2 years ago is currently having a sexual relationship with my wife of 4 years f28 behind my back and has been since late summer or maybe even before that. what am i supposed to do? should i tell my mother?. i'm sorry if this is a little much. i've been sitting in my car for a few hours, sorry for errors im on mobile. 

my wife and i have been married for 4 years. we argue sometimes over little things but i love her with all my heart. there's never been anything wrong until now. i thought we were happy, i always treated her right and got listened to her. i took her out whenever she wanted and studied with her. she doesn't work because she's getting her degree right now, so i gladly pay for everything and work overtime constantly because i wanted her to be great. she goes to classes nearly full-time and spends the rest of her time home or her school library. 

i'm not close to my mother at all but i see her from time to time. recently we've been trying to reconnect but she's just really not a good person. she was horrible to me growing up but i tried to forgive her for her personality and actions. she has alot of bad habits and had 2 failed marriages with really shitty dudes. she recently got remarried to another man 2 years ago, let's call him x. my mother invites me and my wife and it's the first time they all meet. probably 4th time i've met him since they married fairly quickly. he seemed.. okay. just really didn't like his vibe too much. but i gave him the benefit of the doubt because at the end of the day it's her life, not mine and we aren't close.

last year, x asks for help remodeling my mother's house for the day. my wife suggests we stay for the week and make it a bonding thing, i agreed. i thought we could all do things together but we ended up breaking into little teams. x and my wife really hit it off and i'm not very good with construction/renovation related things i ended up going out with my mother a few times to eat in an attempt to bond with her. it was weird but we tried. my wife stayed behind and helped x remodel. her family is really involved in the construction/engineering world so she knew much more than i about how to help fix the house up.  they seemed to really be close that week aka sharing jokes and laughing alot when i wasn't around and super animated conversations but i didn't think much of it because i assumed she was just being nice to my new ""step father."" i trusted my wife. 

she started going back over to my mother's house to help x out afterwards. they live almost an hour away so it's out if the way. i noticed when she'd be coming home way later than normal and decide to take the train instead of me pick her up. she kept saying library at first before she admitted to going there to help renovate since i wasn't ""much help"" in terms of helping my mom fix up the place. it was like once or twice a week. this started happening early this year. when the house was finished late spring, they kept hanging out which i didn't mind. i guess that makes me stupid. when her classes ended in summer we stopped spending as much time together but she made nothing seem wrong. she seemed happy, our sex life was the same, we were trying for a baby, everything was good even communication. i tried to go with her to my mom's place but she was usually with her friends when she wasn't home and i didn't really like x's humor/mannerisms. i didn't mind, i worked alot and liked to be alone sometimes. 

a few weeks ago she got home late again and went to shower. i always joked that she'd use up all the cities water with how long she showered. she was in there a bit, probably 1am when her phone pings and vibrates. it does this like 4-5 times in a few minutes. i didn't wanna invade her privacy but that's very abnormal. i tapped her screen to see what it was and i recognized the number. it was x's. he sent multiple mms messages with his face and nude pics of himself. there were replies from her with nude photos that were recent. just alot of words i haven't processed yet. i took an extended screenshot of it, took a few minutes, and mailed it to myself and put the message on unread so she wouldn't know i saw. i really wish i didn't. i really would have honestly just not have known and kept everything perfect. there are months of texts, blocks of text and photos and heart emojis, i took a few days off work the following morning and flew down to see an old friend lives in the midwest. he's hooking me up with a month to month studio no questions asked since we dont talk much anymore. she doesn't know i'm leaving in jan which is when our lease is up. i told her it was a trip for work and she just smiled and told me to have fun and she'd miss me. i came back and she didn't seem any different. our anniversary is the day before christmas eve.  i haven't told my mother, not sure how or if i want to. i haven't told anyone except you, reddit. i want to get out of here and be alone and think. 
 

it's been a while but i still haven't had the heart to go through all of the texts and photos. i feel like reading it all would make it all worse for me. i already feel broken and empty. i left my friends behind for her and started a life with her. i thought she was happy. we have been trying to get pregnant slightly before and around the time i found out and were supposed to go check in with the docs after the holidays. i need some time to think and i need to know how to fix this with my wife? how do i tell my mother? i love my wife with everything she's all i have i gave her everything these last 4+ years. i cant just  divorce, im not going to follow in my mothers footsteps. 

i know it all seems outrageous given he's married to my mother but i don't have anyone else to talk to. i was supposed to be home 5 hours ago but i don't think i can lay next to her anymore. i've been forcing myself to try and get over it and hope it just goes away and it makes me feel more and more disgusted with myself. i'm probably gonna sleep in my car tonight. she's already called me 3 times and i'm just exhausted emotionally. it hurts ignoring her calls. i'll try to check back for any answers later tomorrow if i have the time. im sorry if this post was a waste of your time but i hope you have advice. 

tldr my wife is having a sexual relationship with my mother's new husband and i want to know how to stop it and fix my marriage somehow",8
"(update) i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/

it all came to a head last night.  she just came out and asked me if i did not love her anymore and all that i could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.  

this started a larger conversation that i won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that i would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that i would have felt like i could have worked on it.  i would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me.  but to know that i was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something i thought i could get over any time soon or if i ever could for that matter.

i was even honest and said that if it was just a ons she had or some random guy who was just huge i might be able to get past that.  but knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when i met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than i could handle.

she kept trying to tell me how much better i was at everything else and that i should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect.  i told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes i needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that i can never be.

i tried my best to be gentle, i tried to take all of the blame of stating that i knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who i am.  

btw i'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

this is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one.  i am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation.  everybody's christmas is ruined.  we had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.  

this alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am i going to say is the reason why we are not together?  she didn't cheat and if i say that i felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth.  it's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

in the end i feel like a massive failure.  i feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and i feel like a failure because i wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

she has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially i said no because at the end of the day what does it change?  we can talk about every single thing and i can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who i wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what i do i will never be as good as her ex.  i just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.  

but because she legitimately seems heartbroken i agreed to go.  but that does  not mean i will keep going.  

today i moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until i can get a place for myself.  she has been with her sister all day.  

i feel like shit.  

thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response.  i honestly have tried to read everything even if i didn't reply to very many.

the bitch of all of this is that i still love her.  there is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

edit:  well once again i posted this and then went away for awhile.  i went with my friend to see mortal engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so i started reading awhile ago.  it is going to take me forever to read and once again i don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages.  but thank all of you for reading and responding.

edit 2:  i guess i do want to share one thing i spoke with her about.  when we were having our very long conversation i presented her with a scenario for her to compare.  i know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me.  so i put the scenario to her like this.  i said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend tim and you heard this.  ""jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way tiffany did""  ""but its not jill's fault tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person i've ever known and jill just isn't as smart"".  then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been.  ""i love you for all of your other qualities"".  ""nobody makes a sandwich like you do and i think long term you wont gauge me for my money""
at first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex.   she ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it.  i then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw i would never say to anyone out loud about anyone i loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.   
edit 3:  if anyone even reads this i want to add one last thing.  people have been telling me what a whiny bitch i am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because i can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me.  not going to lie and say i'm thrilled with it but i'm not dumb enough to think i have a giant magic wand or anything.  i had grown up believing what i now know to be a lie that women don't care about size.  some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did.  but even with that ultimately i might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact.  but hearing that no matter what i did, how much i loved her or any other thing that i was never going to be as good is what has bothered me since.  yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if i hadn't heard that i would never be the lover i think i might have been okay.  well not okay but at least not relationship killing.  yes i overvalue sex.  i get that.  yes it is very important to me and well frankly i want to be wanted as much as i want to want someone, if that makes any sense.  yes i know whoever i date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever.  but i would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later.

"update: i (27m) just learned my wife (27f) lied about her past, including being sexually assaulted by my best friend.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b5dgn5/i\_27m\_just\_learned\_my\_wife\_27f\_lied\_about\_her/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5dgn5/i_27m_just_learned_my_wife_27f_lied_about_her/)

&#x200b;

wow, just wanted to say thanks everyone for the advice.  as expected i received a ton of different opinions, and i thank you all.  however some of them really helped put me in a better state of mind.  specifically those of you that opened my eyes to the fact that it may have still been abuse despite the texts, and even shared some of your own personal stories that relate to my wife's story.  it helped me approach her in a less accusatory manner.  

&#x200b;

i had a long and productive discussion with my wife last night about the things that i had found and that bothered me.   
 i told her i just wanted the truth, and that i wasn't angry.  she explained that while she was abroad she was partying and drinking pretty heavily, and at the time that f took advantage of her, she didn't fully understand what had happened.  she was in denial after it happened since she never expected a friend to do that.  she was surprised she even sent some of those texts to him, and she said she was likely drunk and trying to convince herself that it was okay.  when f finally left the country a couple days later and she had time to really think about it, she realized that what had happened was wrong.  she had told f to stop but didn't have the strength to physically stop it, she had no choice in the situation.  she also pointed out that once f left, she had stopped talking to him because of this, which was true in the texts.  they went from talking nearly every day to nothing instantly.  there were also some other things she pointed out that line up with the texts to suggest that after it happened, she took some measures to avoid having sex with him again(for example, sharing a bed with someone else when the option to sleep with f was available).

&#x200b;

i know some of you wanted me to talk to f.  but i have no desire to, and i definitely would have a harder time believing anything from him.  there was plenty of texts from f to w lying about me in order to give himself an opportunity with her.  he lied to her saying i was getting back with my ex(who lived 1000 miles from me, and had a boyfriend at the time), and told w countless times she never had a chance with me.  w had told me these things in the past and the texts all back that up.  

&#x200b;

my wife's story is consistent with any other time she has ever told me, and after our discussion i'm sticking by her side.  we discussed our other relationship issues too.  like i said, we had been struggling recently.  but the past month has actually been better than the previous 6 or so.  not perfect, but definitely an improvement.  she told me that the main reason for some of her actions and words was simply being pregnant, uncomfortable, and not having anyone besides me to vent her frustrations out to.  she was sorry for how she treated me and is going to work on herself to be better.  she wasn't mad that i looked through her messages, she even said i'm welcome to look.  but she promised she has nothing to hide.  whether you agree or disagree with me, i married this woman for a reason.  and while we may be in a bit of a difficult time, i believe we are on the right path.

"my girlfriend won't sleep with me because she's afraid to get pregnant... to clarify, i don't mean sex, when i say ""sleep with me"", i literally mean she won't lay in the same bed as me because she's afraid to get pregnant. we are both 18 in college and, tonight, she was spending the night in my dorm after watching ""a quiet place"". we both laid down and she was adamant that her or i sleep on the floor. so, i slept on the floor, and she still put her pants on because ""oh your semen can end up in there"". this is the same girl that was worried after we made out (in full clothing) that she was pregnant. this is so frustrating and i've had to have the birds and the bees talk with her and she's still pulling this shit. i tried laying in the bed and she started complaining and now, somehow, we are both on the floor, mad. what do i do?",8
"muslim guy 22m whom i 22f multiply rejected over the years writes to my friends to find out about my virginity. we have been attending the same university over the last 6 years and share a lot of common friends.

during the first year of uni, he has asked me out and i declined. during the years, i have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. i guess, in total, i had to decline him about 10 times or so.

however, during last summer i had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how i am). we have talked a little, and that's all. soon after i had stumbled upon him near my house. i confronted him again, he denied following me. after that i told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

it all has been silent until last month. two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if i have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. she didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. he did not reply.

today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

i lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. he denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. i have ranted and once again blocked him.

however, i do not believe this is the end. i am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. i mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

he never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

what am i to do?

update 10/07: i would like to thank everyone for your replies. a lot of helpful advice was given, i really appreciate it. the situation doesn't seem so unmanageable as before.

also, to those wondering why am i 22 after 6 years of university - well, that's how educational system in russia works, my friends.

thank you and stay safe, everyone!",8
"every year my wife has spent upwards of $1500 on new xmas decorations she just throws away after new years. she promised me last year was the last but i just found a huge bag of decorations in the garage. i'm disgusted. what do i do here? (both 34, two kids). wife and i have been married 10 years, we have two kids 5 and 3. wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. i've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during xmas. 

i don't mind her being generous to friends and family. it brings her joy and i appreciate that. but what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of christmas decorations. everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

to best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. she will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. then she'll see one at walmart which features lighting mcqueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. so we'll have 10 new stockings for xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on january 2nd. the rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. replace stockings with any other xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about april on her xmas purchases. i told her enough was enough and frankly i'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. we went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. she agreed.

however i was getting ready for work (i work extra saturday shifts in novmeber and december to afford the holidays, another post i guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new xmas decorations hidden in the garage. i would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. i'm so disgusted i can hardly see straight. 

i'm up at 4:30 on a saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. i feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

what do i do here? sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here. 


edit: my meter is a little off but this asshole is trying to troll me right?

>–from phereiamtosavetheday sent 12 minutes ago
let's see... her problem is that she overspends, exhausts herself, runs out of spoons, and tosses the decor rather than go through the huge and delicate storage game. hey! you live there too. you get to enjoy her cooking, her decorating, her throwing parties for your friends and your family, she does the family gift shopping, sends out the cards, plans the parties, cleans up after the parties... and you? you bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. but you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. hey, i've got an idea, mr. man. get on your tiny snowflake feet and put the fucking decorations away. then there they are, next year. her? she's fucking tired after bringing you, the children and everyone else a nice holiday. or ask for a bouncy seat this christmas, so that you can watch her struggle while laying back and sucking on a bottle.",8
"update: my 34m wife 28f wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend. original post(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bev4g9/my_34m_wife_28f_wants_to_name_our_baby_after_her/)

hi all!

wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than i expected. first of all, i want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. it means a lot.

now, onto the update.

for easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a bbq at her sister's. not wanting her family to see any tension, i saw this as a chance for her to have to speak to me. as we're getting ready for church, i tell her that we need to talk about everything now. she agreed and sat down with me.

i did tell her that there is absolutely no way we're naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). she agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

also, i know a lot of you suggested that i get a paternity test. i know that i'm 100% the father. i didn't want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. i thought it out, but, i still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. she adamantly said no. she had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. she tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn't in love with him anymore. she described him as not being a good person at all.

she apologized for making me feel that way.

i told her that i understand she's going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn't help at all. but, i had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

she started to get choked up and was shaking. i told her that she could tell me. 

she confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn't his first choice.

she also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. she wasn't expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn't want it too. she talked about how she thought we'd travel and that she'd continue racing her motorcycle. now, she's not even sure if she'd be able to ride again. she actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex's death reminded her how much of a risk it is. she doesn't want to risk her life when she has a family. she feels gutted. 

regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn't change a thing about her life now and that she's happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. we're the best things that has ever happened to her.

anxiety also runs in my wife's family. my wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. it's so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

after discussing things, she decided that she'll be going into therapy.  she has her first appointment this week.

tldr: wife feels guilty about ex's death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he'd fall off his bike and die. she keeps thinking about how he died. wife also said that she's happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there's a lot going on and it's a lot. she's sad that she probably can't ride motorcycles anymore. wife will go into therapy this week.",8
"i (19f) dumped and blocked my boyfriend (19m) for his comments about my neighbourhood.. i don't want anyone having the slightest clue about where i'm from, so i'll be kinda vague.

i live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. it wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. it's home. now that i'm at a huge university in my city, i've met people from all types of backgrounds. of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. he's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. but i was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. we really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

in my neighbourhood there is a small *""establishment""* that offers free *""services""/""products""* to kids who get good report cards/gpa. that applies from elementary school and until the end of college. college kids who provide id also get a crazy discount. finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. the good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.

it's like, in my hood hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. i think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. it's super lowkey.

i took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. he never seemed scared or judgemental. when we walked in, i was getting out my school id. i explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. he laughed. i asked him what was so funny.

he said ""they shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". i asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

he says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. that getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. i told him that is where i live. it's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

this started a huge argument.

i asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. i have 3. they were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. it's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. my mom goes to a new funeral every week. some of the kids i grew up with are in jail right now. my mom still hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. he said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. that there's ""nothing impressive about not being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". and that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass *'establishment'* '"". that this is why people get dependant on welfare.

at this point i told him i was done. i didn't want to debate, i didn't want to talk him. not then, not ever again. we just went out separate ways. i broke up with him as soon as i got home.

he thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. that we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. i told him, yes the fuck we are. he's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  i think i may have overreacted with the block, but i want him to leave me alone. i don't want to work it out.

all my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood..

i'm not saying i have to be with someone who's from my hood. but i have to be with someone who at least gets it. especially when ""it"" has shaped who i am today. idk what kind of person i am, but i think i might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it. that ""establishment"" means a lot to me.

edit: i'm sorry i wasn't clear. should i let him reach out to me? i don't want to get back together, but should i unblock him and talk it out. i'm worried that i'll fold and we might get back together. i've seen my friends do it all the time, they always go back. i'm worried conversation will make that happen to me. **i didn't suddenly stop loving him** and he still means a lot to me. but our core values don't align. what he said and did disgusted me. in the very place that means so much to me, he shit all over it.

edit: guys i did not make it out the hood at 19, i still live there lmao. i'm still a fulltime student at a big university in my city, working my ass off so one day i can get my whole family out.

"my boyfriend choked me. we went to a concert last night. and had some drinks. his mood turned toward the end of the evening and seemed grumpy. i kept asking why he was mad at me and he wouldn't tell me. he kept calling me a bitch and pulled my hair while i was walking in front of him to the car. on the way home he wouldn't say one word to me. when we got inside his apartment i said ""please talk to me. why are you made at me? i'm sorry. please don't be angry."" he just snapped and pushed me to the couch and started choking me. i was so shocked. he stared right in my eyes while he did it. i couldn't think of what to do so i slapped him. i just wanted him to let me breathe. then he slapped me back and started choking me again. i didn't pass out but my vision was going black. he got off me and left the room. i grabbed my stuff and ran, going to my house. the next day he didn't apologize he said ""i didn't want to hurt you but you were acting up last night. i love you, but you brought that side out of me."" ....... i don't know what i should do?! i'm so confused. he has never done this before. maybe he was just really drunk.

first of all, i would like to thank everyone for the support, it was really appreciated and it's what let me have the courage to go to the police so i am very grateful. 

i have received some pretty messed up private messages, and i wanted to let you guys know because i don't know how to feel about them, for instance this one: date rapist here: hey i just wanted to let you know you really should keep your fucking mouth closed. i knew a person who didn't and things didn't end well for them. ;) 

(i can provide screenshots if necessary) 

as for how it unfolded: i gave my boyfriend my phone to text s if he wanted, he texted him from his phone as well as from mine. he made it seem like nothing had happened at first on his phone while texting him from mine that i was very upset about what had happened, that i needed an explanation and that i was telling my bf everything. his answer was ""how could you not know i have always liked you? i thought you liked me too."" ""i am sorry i went too far but you gave me all these signs"" ""anyway,\*bf\* doesn't need to know, let's keep it between us, he wouldn't believe you anyway"" and the worst one ""this could still happen if you want, we'll make it our secret."" needless to say my boyfriend was pissed. he then sent a message saying ""what about the drink you got me at the end, i saw you put something in it."" he then called many times but we didn't answer and he ended up saying ""you're crazy, you're imagining things, what the hell is wrong with you?"" then several other messages calling me names that we didn't answer. 

my boyfriend called him and told him that i had told him everything, that he should beat him up and that he would if he ever showed his face again. he also talked to our other friends but not in details, just saying how he acted weird towards me. i don't know what is going to come of that. 

honestly, i just don't want to see him again now. the police has my report and i hope he never tries that again but i can't do much more. 

thank you again for the support.",8
"forced to quit diet. so my gf(31) and me (38) started a keto diet 7 weeks ago. we're both obese. it did work for me, lost 30 pounds since april 1st, feeling good and with energy, no more anxiety and started walking now i'm running on a daily basis.
but it is not working for her. she has lost only a few pounds, looks the same and is hungry all the time. problem is she is so frustrated that wants to quit, but also told me it was unfair and is trying to force me to quit too. i tried to tell her it was unfair too and selfish, but she just got more angry. this is working for me, i've been obese for 20 years and i feel now like never before. i don't want to break up but she is been irrational. what should i do? thanks in advance.

edit- i never expected this level of reaction and the amount of advise you're all giving me. thank you! i'll talk to her, you people have given me great ideas for what to do next. i do understand there are more issues behind her attitude, i will be more supportive of her but will continue exercising. thank you, thank you all.",8
"i 17/m glanced over my shoulder at my girlfriend 17/f going though all her messages, and i saw hearts and ""i love you"" to her best guy friend.. is it normal, or am i just overanalyzing things. she text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. here's the kicker though. he calls her cutie. he's told me in person that he's interested in her. he calls her cutie over text. now, obviously i can't just outright tell her anything, because then she'll know i caught a glance. she said i love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so i guess it's normal. i'm just trying to get some other opinions.

edit one: wow, thanks everyone, seriously. i talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. she was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. i told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. she agreed with me, i think. i told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""i love you"" thing. she has some extracurriculars, so i won't hear from her until around 4:45. thanks everyone, so much. i'll let you all know what went down.

edit two: nothing yet from her, but i'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. if i don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

edit three: so, being 17, i have a momma to talk to. so, that's exactly what i did. i went driving with her, i've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and i both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. however, come monday, i will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. obviously, i won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. thank you all for the continual support, i love you all.

edit four: alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. he called me, and apologized. he didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. he said ""it may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. the girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. thank you all, even the ""you're 17 shut up fag"" comments. i love you all unconditionally. night y'all.",8
"my wife (f30) told me that she cheated on me (m28) and i honestly don't know what to do. we have been married for over 5 and a half years. i love her so much. we finally got our own place on december 2018 and things were looking up for us. these 5 years were so magical and i always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that i would marry her again.

this past tuesday, my lead told us that we can vto  (volunteer time off. i work night shift) so my co worker gave me a ride home. (my wife and i share a car). when he dropped me off, i noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. i thought that she parked somewhere else.

as soon as i went inside, i went to our bedroom so that i can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that i am home. the plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

she wasn't in the room. she wasn't home. so i called her and asked her where she was. when she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

my heart broke because i had a feeling of what was going on. she made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. i gave her the benefit of the doubt.

so i was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. she sat on the bed and i asked her if she was okay. she wouldn't answer and began to cry. then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. she said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

i am sad. i honestly thought this would never happen to me. i don't know what to do. we had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. we agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, i am strongly considering in divorcing her. i can't even look at her anymore. the thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. she wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

what should i do? am i overreacting?  i honestly thought of killing myself. i am so sad. she was my everything.

tldr;   wife confessed to cheating. i am so sad. thinking of killing myself.  what do i do?

&#x200b;

thank you

&#x200b;

edit to say: just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) i am so surprised for the support! <3

thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. i still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me,  i forgive her. time will heal this pain and honestly, i love her too much to end this.  we have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. i honestly can't imagine being with another person.  she is truly sorry that she cheated on me. most wont agree with this, but i will give her another chance and see where this goes.

and no, i wont kill myself. i promise.  i really appreciate your concerns and replies. it makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. take care everyone and i'll update as time goes on.. <3

&#x200b;

\*\*\*update 09/13:\*\*\*

i have been reading the comments. i understand that to most it is stupid that i am still with her. i understand. trust me. we have been talking a lot. she is truly sorry and i forgive her. i put her mistake behind me and i am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  we plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. the reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (we will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

&#x200b;

we are working this out. we are still living together. we are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. honestly, it has been going well. things are looking up because soon, i will be transferring to day shift so that i can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that i have been longing for. i still want her in my life and i don't see divorce. we will work this out.

again, thank you all for helping me in my time of need. i am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. it helps. ill update as time goes on. <3",8
"am i being a prick?. basically my so (26f) is unemployed and has begun spending £80 a week renting a horse. her total income is about £130 a week in benefits including child maintenance and we obviously have bills to pay for and rent. i didn't think it was really an option to spend that much money so she could see a horse from time to time but she feels it's completely justified. she's quick to criticise my choice to go out for some drinks maybe once every month or two and i do work full time. for the sake of peace i've told her i'm happy with her decision as long as she can continue contributing towards rent (£35 a week for her) but she's really pissed off that i insisted she explain how she's going to be able to afford it. what do you think, was i an asshole to question her choice?",8
"update family left me (18m) when they thought i wasn't my dad's son but now they want to get back in touch. starts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9ytrw0/family\_left\_me\_18m\_when\_they\_thought\_i\_wasnt\_my/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ytrw0/family_left_me_18m_when_they_thought_i_wasnt_my/)

tldr: dad thought i wasnt his kid and left me. now, it turns out i am his kid and he wants to be in my life again. but it's been four years and he was really shitty to me all this time, so i dont really want to be his pal. family says i'll regret not giving him a chance, and i came to the internet for perspective.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice, but i decided to go with my gradpa's (which was kind of the same most of you gave me) and i'll be standing my ground.

i've been really annoyed lately cause a lot of people around me keep saying i'm a crazy teen and i'll regret it. but grandpa made a point that i need to stop trying to decide how i'll feel in the future. cause truth is you can never know. you have to make decisions now, based on feelings and info you have now. not based on feelings and info you might have later.

right now, i´m disgusted by dad and brother. i want nothing to do with them. i don't trust them. and i even think there is a chance they might be doing this (reaching out) just for optics and money.

if my feelings change, i will deal with that when they do. cross the bridge when i get to it and all.

i wasn't really gonna post an update on this, cause i don't see the point. my story is kindda over.

but something happened yesterday and i wanted to share.

so i decided to stand by my ""fuck no, i don't wanna talk to them"". i'll be moving to another city soon and decided to change my number. grandpa is the only one who will be having the new one, i asked him not to share and i know he wont. he is a retired cop, so he's really badass and has zero patience for bullshit, my new number is safe. he called my mom and told her that, from now on, if anyone wanted to reach me, they'd have to go through him.

so mom showed up at his place (i've been living with him for a while) and tries to talk to me, but grandpa says she has to talk to him first, so he can decide whether she is allowed to talk to me or not. looool so mom goes insane, and starts telling him that it's none of his business and that this is between me and my dad, so grandpa goes something like ""if anybody shows up at my lawn to disturb the boy, i'll get the cops, a restraining order and a shotgun"". it goes on for a while until mom says i'm not the only family grandpa has, and that by doing this, grandpa is pushing everyone away and splitting the family, he has other grandchildren, why is he picking just the one, and so on... so grandpa fucking laughs and tell her that through no fault of his, this family blew up long ago, and everyone just grabbed a piece of what was left and ran for it. he looks at me and says i'm his piece, so he's not letting go and fuck it.

i was feeling like laughing up to this point cause mom was going crazy and all, but when he fucking said that, i broke. mom left after a while and i just hugged my old man like life depended on it, and he just said something like ""enough now, no need for that, i'm your family, family doesn't leave. you remember that when you have one of your own"", and i fucking will.

&#x200b;

tldr: won't be pals with dad and brother. i'm good. grandpa is the shit.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit - o, before i forget. some people were asking about what my siblings were like. well, my older brother stole/took shit that were mine or supposed to be mine, he lied to me and about me (and not the innocent kid lie, but fucked up shit that ruined relationships i had with friends, family, even a girlfriend i cared about). he was a huge bully for years, even hit me once. mom said ""he's going through a lot to"" and dad couldn't care less and just protected him. grandpa told him if he ever hit me again, he would break brother's teeth in. i guess he believed him, cause he never touched me after the one time.

younger brother is cool, i'd rather not talk about him here

&#x200b;

another edit - i read the comment section to grandpa, i had to explain what og is and he now wants to watch breaking bad and better call saul lol, but we thank you for all the love. reading the replies on my first post he just said ""the internet is very smart"", reading the replies on this update he got a little emotional and left saying he had stuff to do. but he got a beer, came back and asked if ""there were more people saying stuff"". the comment comparing him to clint eastwood made his day! thanks for the love guys",8
"my husband has sex with me while i sleep wth?. ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while i'm asleep. i know it sounds crazy! im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. on a few occasions i've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows i'm waking up, he stops. i am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. i hate sleeping in clothes, i'm a naked sleeper but i don't think that is an open invitation right?

 last weekend, i woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until i acted like i was still asleep, i wanted to see how far this was going to go.  i pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime i ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until i fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and i said.... was that good for you? he tried to act like he was asleep!!! i told him i was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. his answer...i was horny, it wont happen again. 

fast forward a week...i haven't been talking to him all week. i go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. i confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, i'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if i did that to him and when i asked why he stopped when i woke up he says because he knew i'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. i am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. i'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe i could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

at this point in feel like i can't trust  him anymore and i don't know what to do. has anyone else ever dealt with this? do you think i should believe him? he is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though i've told him i've caught him before.

"was i(25m) wrong for telling my wife (24f) ""if i'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."". first, some back story. sorry, little bit of a long one. my wife(24f) and i(25m) have been married for almost two years, but have been together for over seven years. shortly after we moved in together, about two years into our relationship, i learned my wife has an issue with getting these whiskers that grow on her chin. she told me it was because of a hormonal imbalance, but she was very good at plucking or waxing them so i wouldn't notice. she was very self conscious about them, so she tried to make sure they weren't present as often as possible. i completely understood that it was out of her control that it occurs, and i hardly even noticed because she kept on top of it so well.

day one of when we started dating, she made it very clear to me that she hates beards on the men that she's with. she thinks they're very unattractive. well, not on every guy. she likes beards on certain actors. but definitely not on me. so i have stayed clean shaven for her. if i even forget to shave, even for a couple days, she won't even kiss me because she hates the beard that much. she'll usually comment on it multiple times a day until i do shave. progressively getting worse until i do the deed. but it's whatever, having to shave often doesn't bother me. i'm in the habit now of shaving every day or at least every other. if i could, i'd probably try to grow it out and see how i look with a legit beard, but my wife would definitely not allow it.

back to the my wife's whiskers: since we've gotten married, my wife has gotten.. comfortable. these whiskers of hers; she now goes weeks, even a month + without plucking them. after a whole month, these 5-10 whiskers are as long as the hair on my head (i have average length hair). now, i love my wife to death, no matter what she looks like, i want that to be clear. but these whiskers: i'm not a fan of them. they're not soft, barely visible hairs, they're long, shiny, and resemble thick fishing line.

she gets on me about my appearance, especially my facial hair. after a month of her not taking care of her issue, i finally said in the most loving way i could ""hey, babe, your whiskers are getting kinda long. your coworkers might notice, maybe you should pluck them or something?"" she got quite offended. but, she took care of the problem. a few weeks go by, and once again, she let her whiskers get long. i make another suggestion that she should take care of them, this time, she completely shrugs me off. says she's ""too tired and will do it later."" keep in mind, she bought a handheld battery operated hair puller thing for this very purpose. it gets rid of the problem in under 20 seconds. i make a suggestion again a few days later, adding in very kindly that i love her, and don't much care how she looks, but i'm not a fan of them. which again, she was offended, but took care of it. now i'm stuck in this cycle of she let's it grow, i suggest to get rid of them, she ignores me, then i have to mention it more and more times before she does something about it. always getting pissed off that i dare say something. it's at the point where if i don't say anything, she won't do it.

a few days ago. she was ripping me a new one because i wanted to have sex, but i haven't shaved my beard for a few days, and she didn't want to do anything since i was ""too scruffy."" it's been about three weeks since she's plucked her whiskers so they're at least an inch long. i snap and say ""this is bullshit, i shave almost every day for you. to look my best for you. but you won't get rid of those things on your chin once every couple weeks for me, even though i've kindly told you i don't like them."" and i finish with ""if i'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" needless to say, she was incredibly pissed and we did not have sex that night. we're okay now. i've shaved since then. she has not.

was i wrong to have said this? was i wrong to look at this as a double standard? should i have approached this differently?

&#x200b;

* update 1: some of you recommended laser hair removal or a similar permanent hair removal process. we have talked about laser hair removal in the past for her. she seemed interested, at first, but then made an excuse along the lines that she'd ""have to go back for multiple sessions and doesn't have the time for that."" i haven't tried to bring it up since.
* update 2: some are asking if it's the look of the beard or the fact it's rough and scratchy she doesn't like. in this case, both. she says she doesn't like how i look with a beard. i've never had a beard while i've been with her, so how she came to that conclusion, i do not know. hell, i don't even know what i look like with a legit beard. earlier in the relationship, if i had stubble, and kiss her, she'd comment that it ""scratches and it's uncomfortable."" which frankly, i understand. but then it evolved to her avoiding the kiss all together.
* update 3: pcos. yes, she has it. she's known she's had it for a long time. i believe she was diagnosed with it before, or shortly after we first met. the hair growth probably is a side effect, and she has always handled it well. up until recently.
* update 4: everyone recommending i should post this in /r/amitheasshole. no can do. that sub has a 3000 character limit. my post far exceeds that. feel free to tell me if i'm the asshole here if you like.
* update 5: thank you to those of you that have commented, or reached out to me, on different medications or procedures she could try that would help. i will definitely mention these to her. when the time is right of course. i appreciate you folks.
* update 6: an **overwhelming** majority have suggested saying to her ""*i'll shave when you do.*"" that works for me. i'll definitely have an update to how that conversation goes.
* update 7: ""*you shared this story with your guy friends!? you're a monster!*"" but sharing my story with thousands of strangers online is okay? lol. i actually went into **far more** detail with you fine folks. i only shared this argument with two of my very close friends. and i only mentioned the bits about her getting on me about shaving my own beard. not the personal bits about her. not that i need to defend myself, but there you go.
* update 8: ""i'll shave. when you do"" update post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avhkks/update_was_i25m_wrong_for_telling_my_wife24f_if/)",8
"update my(27f) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31m). everyone thinks i should break up with him but i don't want to. what do i do?. original post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cohppg/my27f_son6_doesnt_like_my_boyfriend_31m_everyone/)

turns out it really was something his grandparents said as many of you suggested. they said some things that made my son think that my boyfriend and i will make our own family and he'll be the fifth wheel and i will no longer love him. i reassured him and made sure he understood i will always love him and that he will only have more people love him, not less. boyfriend and i agreed we needed to spend more time together with him and we've been doing that and he's warmed up to bf surprisingly quickly. so that's working out really well and my boyfriend has been really wonderful throughout this, i feel kind of ashamed for even considering breaking up with him. i've been told ""i told you so"" by my brother..

i have been putting off talking to his grandparents. but i will definitely talk to them before i let my son spend time with them again. i want to make it clear to them that it's not acceptable to say or insinuate things like that to my son but also want to reassure them that they will get to see him (so long as they don't put weird ideas in his head). i think i will see them by myself and lay it all out and then maybe have a little break before letting my son visit them...?

edit: thank you all for your kind words and advice. honestly overwhelmed by the amount of responses. wasn't expecting it. i know many of you think that i should cut his grandparents off but i honestly don't think they must've said something like that directly to him. maybe he misunderstood. i will find out for sure when i speak to them. i am taking this very seriously and it's definitely a possibility depending on how everything goes.",8
"my(39m) daughter (17f) wants me to sleep in her room because she broke up but i suspect something mire to it.. edit: the title should be more to it not mire.

i know this is actually a really weird situation. i'm sorry i do my best to raise her but i know that i can never fill the void her mother left when she passed away.

yesterday out of the blue, my daughter asked me to sleep in her room. when i asked her if everything was alright she started crying and told me that she broke up with her boyfriend and she didn't want to talk about it. she told me she doesn't fesl safe anymore. 

i just didn't push the issue and slept in her room. she didn't want to talk today either. i think something's really wrong, because we are super close and she tells me everything but reluctant to talk about this. what do i do?

update:  hey guys i sincerely thank everyone here for showing their support and giving me some much needed advice. i just wanted to update this. so, my sister came over and took her out so they can have some alone time together. it turns out that she broke up with her boyfriend because he's been cheating on her. now he's just being and idiot and bombing her with messages and calls. she just blocked him. but he's basically threatening her with ""consequences"" for breaking up with him.

"update: boyfriend's (21m) best friend (20f) hates me (25f) and wants us to break up.. first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3eda8/_/

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

"just found out my girlfriend 26f of 6 years was cheating on me while i'm 30m spending the holidays with her and her family.. my girlfriend and i have been in a serious relationship for six years, and we started doing long distance relationship about 1.5 years ago due to both of us being in graduate schools. things have been fine until five months ago when i found out she was using a subscription dating app. i was disappointed and broke up with her, but we eventually got back together because she convinced me that she didn't go on any dates with anyone on the app. i believed her because i know that she is a very traditional girl and she lives with her family. after we got back together, i felt that our relationship wasn't what it used to be, and i often felt neglected by her. she would spend a lot of time texting even when we are facetiming at night. she told me she texting her girl friends and i believed her. i went to celebrate the holidays with her family this winter break, and she was on her phone a bunch as usual. but i noticed that she wouldn't let me look at her phone and acting suspicious a lot of the time. she also told me she's going on a ski trip with a guy friend in march, but dodged questions when i asked for details of the guy. finally, i've had it and looked through her fb messages, and i found conversations of her flirting with another guy for the past months. i confronted her about my findings and she admitted to having a crush on the other guy for months but nothing happened... just flirting on the internet. plus the guy did not quite reciprocate the feelings. but upon further questioning, she told me that she actually met up with that guy two weeks ago when she came to my city to visit me (the guy lives in the state i am going to graduate school in). she told me that they only kissed that night. i asked her to show me her texts and fb messages, but she refused for several hours before letting me look through them. i found out that she's been texting and flirting with him the whole time we've been spending the holidays together, and she changed his name to a female name so i wouldn't be suspicious. she also didn't tell him that we were a couple again and still refers to me as her ex. she was apologetic when i confronted her and i made her cancel the ski trip and cease communication with him. she reassured me that nothing will happen since he lives in my state far away from her and that he's not interested in a relationship anyway.

i feel so hurt right now and can't fall asleep. she's my first girlfriend and i love her so much. her family treats me like another son. but the logical side of me knows that i cannot trust her anymore. i have to stay with her until saturday and i don't know what to do. 

tl;dr long term, currently long distance girlfriend flirted with another guy via texts and fb for months even during the holidays when i'm visiting her. she met with him once when she came to my city to visit me and they kissed.

update:
thanks for all of the supportive comments and thank you for those that shared their similar experiences. maybe i'm an idiot for missing all of the red flags, but hope is a helluva drug. we talked again this morning and decided breaking up was the best thing to do. it was an amicable breakup and we talked about what went right and what went wrong in our relationship (other than the part where she cheated on me). she pretty much said she didn't feel appreciated by me, and she lost her feelings for me after our initial breakup. we both agreed that she was wrong and that she should've broken up with me properly before trying to start a new relationship. she feels ashamed of what she did. i will still stay until saturday because flight tickets are crazy expensive right now and not economically feasible for me to fly home. but we will definitely be breaking up after this incident. being separated by thousands of miles and a jam packed curriculum from school will hopefully make this break up a bit easier. thank you everybody for your input.

"a tinder experiment with my 28m girlfriend 27f of 3 years has gone horribly wrong.. hi all. 

&#x200b;

i've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and thereabouts, and all was going pretty well. i met her irl, but before that i was having no success with the tinder game. she, herself, never used it ever.

&#x200b;

2 weeks ago, she was telling me about some of her friends' horror stories on tinder, and i laughed with her and added ""tinder's way worse for guys, though"". she didn't believe me when i told her most guys get 0 matches, and i wouldn't either. so we decided to play (what seemed at the time) a fun game : set up tinder profiles of each other and see what happened. and the obvious happened: after one week, i had pretty much no matches except bots. on the other hand, she was bombarded with matches and messages, quite a few of them from pretty attractive guys (or at least, what i judge to be attractive guys, a lot of them probably more than me). she admitted i was right and that it was an ""eye opener"". we agreed to shut down our profiles.

  
the problem is, ever since, she's grown slightly more distant and cold, and it's now beginning to be noticeable. basically less happy to see me, much less in the mood for sex, not as physical or cuddly as before, and more importantly way more monosyllabic in our conversations. etc. i sat her down yesterday to talk about it, and she was evasive. when i asked if the tinder experiment had anything to do with it, she looked away and just vaguely said ""i don't know, maybe"". 

&#x200b;

i feel like i've played myself here. is this doomed or is there any way i can save it? 

&#x200b;

tl ; dr: played a tinder experiment with my girlfriend and now it looks like she's way more distant and cold towards me.

"my 36m wife 34f has been having an affair with her own brother and i realised our son might not even be mine.. i dont know how or where to begin. this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

​

my wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). new people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister.

​

my brother in law lives very close to us. he is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. my own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. this is something i never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. it wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that i got suspicious. apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

​

now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth i dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. that is just...disgusting to me. tonight i did something which i never done or felt the need to do before, and i checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. but after having scrolled through a ton of messages i find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. i am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

​

having sit here now thinking about what to do i cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. so many times have i heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

​

i am really at a loss at this point, i have no doubts about what she has done, but i cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

​

i feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

​

i want to divorce her, but i dont know how to go on about finding out whether i am the father or not, i really dont know what to do if i found out my son wasnt mine.

​

edit: after reading several comments i decided it is best to not confront her now. my wife has been asking me multiple times what is wrong and i just told her i am not feeling well. i can barely look her in the eyes at this point. the only reason i am keeping it together is for my son. i wanted to go and sleep at a hotel but it would just raise too many questions on her part, so i will sit infront of the tv and sleep on the couch.

​

edit 2: had no idea this post would spiral out and get this many responses, thanks i guess. i wont be reading more pm's, i have gotten way too many of them.

currently staying with my sister, i decided it was not a good time to confront my wife yesterday, so i just told her i will be moving in to stay with my sister for a few days as she needed help with some stuff. my sister lives about 30 minutes away from us. i have told everything to my sister and she thought it was best to meet with a lawyer. we scheduled a meeting today, he will be helping me with the divorce and has also offered to help me get a paternity test (read some comment about a guy who did a paternity and got the wrong result) which is why i will get it via a court.

i will be getting a divorce for sure, this is not something i will ever accept or can forgive. it's beyond f\*\*\*ed up. to the feminists out there who messaged me and told me to step up and forgive her, f\*\*\* you too.

i will confront her but i cant tell when, probably tomorrow. my sister wants to come with me, but i wont let her, i will head over there by myself and let her know what i found out, will see where it goes from there...

"i think my (22f) boyfriend (25m) mostly likes me because of my race.. i've been seeing this guy for about 5 months. everything has been going really well so far.

i'm half japanese/korean and half white. for reference, i've been told by multiple people, including him, that i look like kiko mizuhara. (although i don't agree, i love the compliment btw)

so i've known since the beginning that he loves japanese culture. no biggie, whatever. i've dated weeaboos before, and it never turned into a problem. 
somehow my mom got brought up and how i'm more japanese than korean. he got weirdly excited. it kind of weirded me out, but i let it go.

then he said that i ""shouldn't call myself white"" because i'm hapa. that pissed me off, but i didn't make a big deal out of it. then he said something along the lines of ""you're so lucky you got the best features from both races"" and i was so grossed out.
it escalated, and it basically ended with me saying that i felt fetishized and then he sounded like he was into eugenics. he got angry because he said i called him a nazi. (i did not. i said what he said sounded like eugenics) he then proceeded to cry and say ""it's not my fault i have yellow fever"" and ""japanese girls are tighter and are more submissive""

i'm honestly afraid to tell our friends about it, but i'm pretty sure i'm done with him. i've had white guys do kinda racist stuff before, but never to this extent. all of our friends are white, and i'm afraid they'll think i'm overreacting or something. idk. i guess i'm just looking for some type of reassurance that what he said isn't okay. 
thanks

edit:
thank you everyone who responded. it really means a lot to me. to clarify, we had been drinking a little bit, but not that much at all. i have decided to completely end things. i'll never be able to think of him the same way, and it would always be in the back of my head. the friends i have spoken to totally agree with me. i feel so respected by them, and it means the world to me. so yeah, thank you all again. you all made this so much easier for me. i'm just so, so thankful to have all of these kind strangers support my decision!

edit 2: again, i just want to thank you all! i've blocked him number because he wouldn't stop calling me. my friends are being so supportive- just like you guys. honestly, i'm not super sad about it anymore. i feel like a dodged a huuuuuge bullet. and to those of you saying you hope this is fake.. i really wish it were too.

edit 3: wow! i really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. again, thank you all. i'm trying to read all the responses because they all mean a lot to me. i just had a night out with a friend, and life feels good. thank you, strangers from the internet. <3

edit 4: i just realized someone gave me gold n silver! tbh, i don't really know what those mean, but thank you!!!! i'm in awe of how kind you all are, and you have seriously made this situation so much more manageable. i can't thank you all enough. i wish i could hug each and every one of you who gave me kind words and/or validation.

edit 5: hey you guys. just wanna give out another thank you. i wish i could read through everything, but i don't think i'll be able to! just wanted to clear some things up:

- to the people who are saying it's my fault for dating a white guy, that's bullshit. not all white people are inherently like this. 

- when i said weeaboo, i mostly meant people who like to watch anime and stuff like that

- i've had a few people message and say stuff like ""there's no way you look exactly like kiko..."" i didn't say i did. i said some people have told me that which is a huge compliment to me. i don't necessary think i look like her, but i do get where those people are coming from. 

- some people have asked to see a photo of me. venmo me and maybe i will lol

- to the people who are still insisting that this is fake, it's really not. reading through all of these comments, i'm pretty disgusted by how prevalent this issue really is

- i'm talking about our mutual friends. i met a couple of them through him. not all of my friends are white, and i knew that none of my personal friends would judge me

- and to the people who said he did nothing wrong, i disagree. i didn't take very much time to make my decision to end things, but i would never be able to see him the same way. the damage was done.

thank you all again.

edit 6:
okay, one more thing. i don't only date white dudes. race has nothing to do with who i'm attracted to.. seriously. i never said i only date white guys. he just happens to be white and our mutual friends are all white. the area that i currently live in is overwhelmingly predominantly white. i do not have ""white fever"", and i should not have expected this.

please stop messaging me asking how tight i am. i will block you.",8
"update i (29m) showed up to my gf's (25f) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am.. update to original post here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw3cuz/i_29m_showed_up_to_my_gfs_25f_house_and_found_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

this all happening a couple days before what would have been our anniversary. i obviously should have seen the signs from the first post but the first part of this update is letting you guys know that i initially did not end the relationship. (what a regret).

how i handled it was we met the next morning to talk and i let her explain her side of things. she explained that other people were at the house that night earlier and she was going to be hanging around with kids from class sometimes now that school has started. keep in mind, she is 25 and going back to school now, and most these kids are around 19-22. nothing super serious as far as class load is concerned, she is studying theater at a community college. i explain to her why all signs point to that being a major red flag, she somewhat hears me out and apologizes for not better communicating her plans that night, but defends herself that hanging out with friends from class is not wrong. so in the future she would be communicate better about her plans and do a better job not making me feel concerned.

i was obviously angry and upset about the previous situation but i did truly love this girl and was willing to give things a chance to progress forward and her show me the positives changes.

we had continued our relationship and everything was going good for the most part. then recently communication did not seem to be going the best and there were some signs that she wasn't giving as much effort into the things we spoke about before as she had promised to do. there were signs of her actively trying to pick fights, and perpetuating them longer than needed even when i had made attempts to reconcile and move forward from any arguments. i did feel heavily at this time that she was not respecting me in these conversations, and any attempts i made to lovingly let her know this...met with hostility. which she then would attempt to turn right back on me, like it was my fault the fight even happened. this was getting old but i was still making every effort to bring us back to a good space on a more every day basis because i was wildly in love with this girl and the connection i thought we shared. the deceiving thing as well is that she was also very good at making me feel at other times she felt the same way about me, 'you're the love of my life, i love you more than anything, future plans together, talking about how lucky she was to be with me' etc. these were all exploited to be absolute lies.

fast forward to a few nights ago. we had plans to hang out that night and when i asked her earlier in the day what she wanted to do, she told me she had actually agreed to go get sushi with a friend she hadn't seen in awhile. i let her know this upset me since she was bailing on our plans, but in attempts to be understanding i then suggested we just meet up after instead and go out that night to do something fun. she did not give me a definite answer but kept bouncing around the subject saying she would keep me updated on when she was finished. i let her know, 'hey you don't cancel plans with your bf, then when hes cool about it and tries to suggest something else... leave him up in the air saying maybe we can hang' it makes me feel like not a priority and isn't how you treat someone you love. she ends up going off on me again and we leave on the terms of ok we will just talk later. i call later and let her know that after dinner it would mean a lot if we could spend some quality time together, i had been wanting that since all the time we were hanging out was during the day with other stuff going on sometimes.

she calls me after dinner around 930pm and lets me know she is home. i ask her to comer hang out so we can figure out what to do, and she deflects with ""oh my other friend (girl who i know) wanted to go to a midnight showing of a movie tonight and i haven't seen her in so long"".... i know i may seem completely stupid to you guys at this point but i assure you i was already seeing through her bullshit and knew something wasn't right. i keep calm and just let her know i think that was messed up, bums me out, and that i wish she would at least try to include me with her friends when doing stuff like that. she then takes to the level of trying to make me feel bad that i cant just be understanding she maybe wants to hang out with her friends without me sometimes. she tells me she will call me after the movie and asks if she can come over and spend the night with me after its finished...

meanwhile, i knew i had friends going out that night as well and i could go grab some drinks with them, finish up around same time and then meet back at my house to spend the night together. i did not tell her i was going out because it did not seem relevant at the time, and i had some weird suspicions that something else was going on.

1:45 am rolls around and im leaving the bar with some friends to grab a burrito before heading home. i walk down the street and lo and behold there she is on the corner of the street standing with a guy. one of the same guys from that night at the house in my original post. shocker, i know. i confront her and ask her whats going on, she attempts to even further lie, explain how her gf was suppose to come to (like that makes it any better lol) it isnt what it looks like, blah blah blah same old bullshit lies and no accountability even when caught in a dead lie on a date with another guy. i turn to the guy and ask him whats going on, he explains he invited to the movies, not much else, looks kind of scared because i'm sure i was irate. i have no problem with him at all because its 100% my then gf's fault. i walk to the side with her and ask her to just be real with me for once, tell me whats going, and come to terms with who she is and what shes done here. she shuts down when she realizes she cant talk her way out of things, and tries to ask if we can talk tomorrow and not make a scene here. i tell her if you want to explain yourself then you can leave right now and i will at least hear you out. she says no im not leaving my friend here alone you are overreacting and its not as bad as it looks. even though i'm pretty hurt at this point i cant help but to bust out in laughter at the disbelief of the whole thing now. i tell her this is it and this relationship is fully done now then. should have been done awhile ago, but that seals the deal and i truly see you for who you are now, a lying manipulative actual sociopath. i left with my friends, blocked her on everything and am now moving forward for good.

i do want to say though, i made a huge mistake in this whole scenario by not leaving when my gut told me to. so many signs pointed to her being so fake, such a liar, and not trust worthy at all... but i let the good times and her manipulative words keep me around thinking that i just needed to make more effort myself to make things work. and it wasn't until i had fully given all of myself into trying, that i was hit with the most disrespectful thing i have ever had done to me. listen to your gut people, and follow you intuition. if you are making clear efforts in a relationship with someone and they are giving you nothing back, creating friction, and show no remorse in any of their mistakes... run for the hills.

even though i was very hurt by the deceit and catching someone cheat on me, i ultimately know this is 100% for the best and a huge blessing in disguise because this person never truly loved me the way i cared for them. who knows how much longer i would have stuck around and let myself be treated like this, but i am grateful it happened now and there is no chance in hell i would ever give her a second of my time again. sorry for the novel, it feels good to vent. much love.

&#x200b;

tldr; attempted to work on things with my gf, gave serious effort and understanding to her. felt i was being treated very poorly in regards to that and got suspicious of her actions. caught her on a date with another guy. broke up with her on the spot, blocked her on everything, moving on.

edit: i really appreciate all the positive response  and feedback i've gotten here. as well as all the insightful messages i've received. i am doing my best to respond to everyone who has taken the time to give me their input, positive or negative. thank you

edit 2: for the people responding thinking i was making assumptions about the situation i walked up on that night, and defending that it could have been just a friend. let me explain that there was no way it was not what it looked like. i did not include the whole dialogue exchange between us, but the guy did make it clear he was under the impression they were on a date. which is when i walked away because it definitely contradicted her whole made up story.",8
"i (m 31) am growing tired of my wife's (f 31) hangups on sex...... ive been with my wife for about 15 years, if you include the time we dated. we have been married for 11 years in august. 

i love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. and it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or ""doggy style"". sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

i constantly tell her how beautiful she is, i tell her how much she means to me, and i try my best to do whatever i can to lay signals that im into her. i hug her, i stand close to her in public, i make it well known that im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

she reciprocates none of it. she never comes on to me unless i straight up ask her to (seriously, ill ask, ""can you do me tonight?"") she doesn't spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. i work long hours, and ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips ""no"" in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. she gets upset if i cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and i came on top of her pussy). she keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. it fucking sucks. the sexiness factor is zero. i love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn't there at all and im not sure i can do it anymore. its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

anywho, it came to head tonight. i asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. she said yes. so the time comes, she was on me and i wasn't totally into it, so i started to get soft. i made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as i had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so i didn't ask). so she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn't want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. i lost it. i said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. this is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and im fucking done with it. she has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

i cant live like this. there is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. this was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

tldr: i am married to my roommate who i occasionally have sugar free vanilla sex with.",8
"update: is a picnic basket too much on a first date?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blwo1p/is_a_picnic_basket_too_much_on_a_first_date/

update: the date went really really well! nature helped me out a little bit and it was extremely nice out. the drive was about an hour to the falls through a pretty remote part of oregon and was super scenic. we only saw two other cars. when we got to the falls we were the only people. chinook salmon were attempting to leap up the falls so it was definitely a cool thing to watch. the bottle of wine came out early and we consumed the entire thing sitting at the bottom of the falls. i kept our picnic simple and made her a sandwich. i think i did good by bringing whole vegetables, a cutting board and knife and half ass chef'd it up in the woods. we stayed until it almost got dark. 


i did another smart move by having our meeting spot be at this indian casino. she said she had never gambled in her life so i brought her in and we had a drink and i gave her 20$ to spend. she found this bee slot machine (my last name has honey in it, so the bee was appropriate) and ended up winning $150! at that point it was getting pretty late so i walked her to her car gave her a kiss and said goodnight. i am going to see her this weekend again. definitely stoked!",8

edit: hey everyone. thank you all so much for the wonderful comments. i've been packing for the past 2 hours to go to my mom's, thankfully he still hasn't come back. if he ran away, its wishful thinking on his end. i talked to my dad, who is an ex-cop, and he knows some people that would help with my situation. 

i honestly cant believe what he did to me, even till now. it was so impulsive of him, he was never like this. regardless, im too disgusted by the thought of him right now. i consider myself to be a resilient person and can brush this off (the experience, not the problem itself), its just that im still shocked by what happened, and the fact that it did. ill reply to some of you as soon as im settled at my mom's.

i just wanna mention that i got a message from someone on here telling me that i should've expected it?? disappointed when i read that.

original post:

my boyfriend and i have been dating for 7 months. we're currently living together (for the past 2 months, edited this part due to people misunderstanding), and we're an admittedly kinky couple, so ""abuse"" is part of our sex routine. we are always safe about what we do, and have a safe word and everything.

last night, he came home from the pub drunk at maybe 2am. i was busy the next day so i slept early and didn't wait for him to come back home. when he walked into our room, he slammed the door open, took off his clothes, and jumped on top of me. he said he wanted to  have sex, and i told him that im too tired to have sex, so he said fine and got up to go to the bathroom.

minutes later, i heard him come back into the room grunting (he's a relatively big guy). he climbed into our sheets fully naked, and started playing with my body. i was tired, but it felt nice so i didnt stop him. then he whispered in my ear ""wanna try anal?"" but i didnt hear him properly, so i just said ""sure, just make it quick."" he then tried to go in, with just his saliva. too dry for even the regular. when i felt it, i immediately told him to stop, and that he was going for the wrong hole. he didn't listen and continued anyway. he plunged himself deeper and it was extremely painful. i screamed our safe word (""b******n"") 5 times and he didn't respond. he just kept going while i was suffering. he covered my mouth to muffle my screaming, and the pain was so intense, i passed out.

when i woke up in the morning, he was gone, and when i got up, i saw blood on our sheets. i was really scared, so i canceled my plans and headed straight to the hospital in a maxipad. after going to the er and doing some tests, it turns out his forceful entrance caused a fissure in my anus. the doctor said i would have to use some medication and that, if the fissure hadn't healed in 4 or 5 weeks, i would have to get surgery.

i just got out of the hospital and am going back home soon. i haven't seen my boyfriend or spoken to him since yesterday. i dont know where he is (nor do i want to), and i honestly don't know how im going to deal with him. what do you think i should do? please help me deal with this.",8
"gf doesn't like me watching game of thrones. so i watch game of thrones. my gf was watching it for the first time last night. i woke up to her ranting about the series saying ""there's nothing but tits in the series"". she then started shitting on me and saying that's the only reason i watch it. i told her i do not get turned on by that, and then i said ""you're getting jealous of me watching a tv series"". she said ""no, i'm jealous of the tits"". also, she have made me watch magic mike with her before, so i thought she was pushing some double standard. she won't talk to me now. am i in the wrong here?

"update my (21m) friend (21f) is being forced to marry a 43 year-old man.. **previous post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my\_21m\_friend\_21f\_is\_being\_forced\_to\_marry\_a\_43/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my_21m_friend_21f_is_being_forced_to_marry_a_43/)

first of all i want to thank everyone for reading my previous post and giving me good advice. your comments gave me further insight in this situation. i apologize for not giving you guys frequent updates to this situation as i was busy with work.

so after my last post i talked with my friends and my college professors about this mess. fortunately almost all of them were ready to help. later during that day we all decided to talk to my friend (21f). we explained to her about the severity of the situation as she was not ready to run away from her house and if she does not act fast she might end up getting married to the old thug ( i know though she might have been frozen in fear, as this is a important decision in her life and she had not made any such decisions before. she is of the type that always follows the crowd and obeys what the others say. ). after lot of convincing from me other friends and professors she finally decided to act. but she was still hesitant to run away as she might bring a lot of suffering to her little sister(14f) who would still be with her parents. so we had to act keeping her little sister in mind. so we convinced her to take her sister with her. we also involved her sister in our plan.

now the main problem was where they would stay and who will help her get along. which was managed by our professor *( dr m. i will not give his full name here. but dr sir i know you browse this sub so if you are reading this, i thank you million times. ).* apparently our professor has a extended family thousands of kilometers from where we live, who are happy to let her and her sister stay rent free for sometime.

so on 25 july at 4am in morning we planned her and her sister escape. we made sure she took her important stuff and documents of her and her sister with her. after we had breakfast at one of my friends place. we all left for the train. we made sure she destroys her old sim card. skip to the day 27 july we arrived at the place and i helped her unpack. bought some clothes for her and her sister and overall they seem to get adjusted pretty quickly. we still need to take admission to school for her sister (fortunately there are free schools for girls in india). and she recently landed a good job. so financially she is settled, but i will still be helping her however she needs.

meanwhile recently we had filed police complaint about her parents and that man. we also informed women's welfare center about this. things seem normal and i will keep you guys updated as things progress.

"my m20 girlfriend f19 of 7 years died in a car accident in front of me. i am completely broken. i need some support. update: my brother decided to end his life... hi, i would like the mods of reddit to delete this post after 2 weeks or so. i just feel the need inform all of you since you showed much interest. 

if you don't remember/haven't read the original post, here it is: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bmn5k/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_of_7_years_died_in_a_car/

as you see from title, my brother decided to end his life two days ago. i am his older brother, i am 23 years old while he was 20. that day, when he posted on reddit, he came to my house (i live in another city), and he decided to stay. we had a long talk, and i was trying to make him feel better, even though that was a hard thing to do. he also showed to me his post on reddit and told me how helpful you guys were, symphathetic and what not.

unfortunately the loss of his girlfriend completely destroyed him. he lost over 10 kgs in just approximately 1 month, he was simply refusing to eat, only a few meals here and there, and even though after some point he decided to seek for professional help, as you also guys suggested him, that didn't help him at all. i was trying my best. until the day he decided to do that he was living in my house, he took a huge break from university so he could focus on healing himself. 

two days ago i was at work, and he was at home, as always. when i came back i saw something that i hope none of you ever experience in your lives.. he hanged himself. it hurts me saying that. it was rather unexpected. even though lately he was showing some warning signs to me, i never thought he would actually do that. about a week ago he decided to stop going to the psychologist that was taking care of him, and when i asked him for the reason, he said ""it's just not needed anymore"".

right next to his dead body there was a letter, and he actually said a bunch of things.he thanked my parents, me, and everyone who was supporting him till the last moment. even you guys. he said he was sorry and his last words were ""tell mum and dad i love them. i can't keep up with this anymore. i am sorry. i love you"".

i tried my best all those weeks to cheer him up, to go out with him and make him feel better, but he would always refuse. i don't blame him. losing someone you truly love and are in a relationship with for 7 years is not an easy thing. even more when you see that person getting killed right in front of you. i am in a complete shock, life was unfair to my brother, and he unfortunately couldn't make it. we were always so close to each other, and he was an amazing brother, an amazing person. it really sucks to say the least. i soemtimes feel it's my fault. 

i felt the need to inform all of you since he posted here a couple of weeks ago and got a huge feedback. i want to say a big thanks on behalf of my brother and from me aswell. you guys are amazing.

thanks once again.

p.s: a few comments here are saying how this is fake, a made up story. if you think that's the case then it's ok. i am not here to argue or try to persuade any of you, but to rather inform you because a couple here showed much interest and genuinely tried to help my bro. sucks to say but things like this do happen, and experiencing such is awful. 

as for the rest of you, thank you people for the nice words.",8
"i think my (31/m) girlfriend (26/f) cheated on me and stole my money.. we have been dating for around 2 years now.

friday night, one of my friends called me and told me he was watching my girlfriend kissing another guy at one of the bars in the area. it's a place her and i don't really frequent, but many of my friends go there on the weekends. since it was crowded, he didn't think she saw him. apparently a little while later, his girlfriend shows up there and sees my girlfriend hanging with this guy they don't recognize, then watching as they kiss again. she never came home saturday morning, ended up coming back around 1 in the afternoon.

there is no reason either of them would lie to me, i've been friends with the guy since 6th grade and with his girlfriend since they started dating 4 years ago. both super nice people.

i confronted my girlfriend about it last night and she freaked, calling them liars, calling me manipulative, and (after initially denying there was another guy) calling the other guy ""just a friend"". i went to work about an hour later and came home a few hours ago. all of her stuff is gone, which is fine with me because i don't believe her and i think she was cheating. worse though, she took my fire safe which contains an emergency credit card, about $700 in cash, my social security card, my passport and the title to my truck. her name isn't on my bank account thankfully but it looks like she's trying to clean me out, how would i proceed?",8
"my (19f) boyfriend (22m) was taking secret nudes and sending them to his friends group chat. i've been dating this guy for about a year now. it's not a long time, i know, but i felt like we really connected and stuff like it feels like we've been known each other our whole lives or something. i sound so stupid, i know. i just really trusted and loved him. a lot. i trusted him with my life. a year cmon 

i went on his phone when he was in the shower to search something up because mine was in the other room and he got some notifications of his friends group chat and they were saying stuff like she's so hot, you're so lucky etc so i was naturally curious and disgusted to find out that they were looking at a video of me that my boyfriend secretly took while i was giving him a blowjob. i am pretty conservative, my parents don't even know that i'm not a virgin, and i have sex with my boyfriend and all that but he knows i do not do pictures because i don't want them to get out and have my reputation ruined, my parents would literally kill me. i remember him on his phone, i asked him what he was doing and he said he was just checking something and then he put it away. i never fucking thought that he was taking a video 

i feel so disgusted i can't even describe the feeling in my stomach like i want to throw up and take a shower and rip my skin off. all these pictures and videos he'd taken of me during sex like quick blurry pictures when my back is turned or short videos like during doggy when i'm not looking at him. i just feel so fucking gross. and who sends that to their friends??? that's so weird!!! you're sending videos of you having sex to your ""bros"", that is so fucking weird. and the other guys would throw in pictures and shit too but those girls were happily posing for the camera and seemed like they knew what was happening 

i cannot even believe he would do this to me. i was still on his phone when he came back from the shower and he quickly grabbed it from my hand and said i was invading his fucking privacy. seriously??? your privacy feels invaded right now??? you clueless asshole. i just started yelling at him and honestly i'm not proud of it but i started hitting him and grabbed his towel. he was acting like i was overreacting and he started hitting me back. are you fucking serious, these guys all have videos and pictures of me and who knows who they showed them to or if they put them online or sold them for money. he started saying some bullshit how his friends think i'm so hot and they just compliment me and it's nothing bad. and you're not gonna believe this... he said they kept pressuring him to contribute to the group chat and he knew i was way too respectable to agree to it so he had to take the pictures and shit behind my back literally. he wasn't even saying sorry and said it was really flattering and they all think i'm so hot  

what kind of a betrayal. i wish this bitch cheated on me or fucked my best friend or dumped me over text or something not as bad as this. i have no idea how many people have seen me naked and having sex at this point and i just wanna step out of my body and throw this one out. i feel so fucking exposed like i saw those videos, i had no idea what was going on, in my head i was thinking about how much i love him and how happy i was and look at what this bitch was doing 

and he texted me afterwards saying we both lost control and we should just say sorry and move on and he'll stop doing it. and he said he was really hurt that i'd take his towel and leave him in a vulnerable state like that and he'd be waiting for my apology. he is so fucking clueless i don't even know what to say",8
"i19m recently found out that my older sister34f is actually my biological mother.. throwaway account because i don't want this linked to my main account.

&#x200b;

my older sister(let's call her rose) and i have a great relationship since i was a baby. we were raised with an amazing adoptive family and she has always taken care of me.

i grew up in a very warm and loving environment but from what i was told i was lucky.

i was told the story of how me and my sister had two drug addict parents who never took care of us. they never bothered feeding us and used to left us at a junky friends house for days to go out partying. when my mom was pregnant with me she smoked and got drunk(luckily i turned out pretty fine) pretty often and when i was born my sister was the only one who took care of me. when i was 2 months old they left us both in a mall and left. we got help from an old couple(who also turned into our adoptive family) and we contacted the police but my parents weren't at the house, which looked like a homeless cave. we never saw them again and after several months in foster care the couple that helped us(throughout the whole way btw) agreed to adopt us. today i'm 19 and rose is 34, i still live with my adoptive family and she lives about 20 minutes away so i come and visit her at least 3-4 times a week.

&#x200b;

so a couple of months ago my friend offered me to take a dna test to find some information about my heritage, since my sister wouldn't speak of them much. after the results came in i found out some pretty interesting things(like being 50% ashkenazi jew) i found out later that i had an aunt\33f\ in the system. i immediately reached out to her(let's call her jennet) and we agreed to meet in person. all that without telling rose a thing.

when we met up i could see we have some similar characteristics like same hair color and same eyes. we tried to figure things out so i asked her if she has a brother or sister and she told me that when she was 13 her 14 year old sister got pregnant while being drunk with her junky boyfriend and a month after giving birth she ran away with the baby after some pretty intensive fights with their parents. they never found her and stopped looking after 1.5 years.

i connected the dots, asked to see a picture of her, so we went to her parents house. mom wasn't home and father died 3 years ago. when i saw the picture, i knew. this was rose, 100%.

rose is my mom, we were never abandoned, we didn't have junky parents and she fabricated the entire thing to me and our adoptive family.

i immediately gave jennet a hug and told her that it's too much for me right now and asked her to keep it a secret for now.

i went to my best friends house, told him everything and for a week now i'm sleeping over at his place. i told my parents and my sister im at his house because he bought a new game that we both wanted for long and avoided talking to rose much.

i can't look her in the eyes right now, let alone tell her i know the truth.

what the hell am i supposed to do? how should i handle this? should i tell her i know?

&#x200b;

edit: my best friend just took me out for a movie and a drink(im not that drunk right now though). i thank you all so much for your warm replies, made me look at the situation a bit clearer. i have decided to break it to rose this week but i need some time to think about how to tell her i know.i don't know if i should try getting there slowly or just break the news to her somehow. i even considered bringing her sister with me but i genuinely think she will be pissed. i'll keep updating as soon as i'll decide how to tell her. right now going to bed to sleep it over.

&#x200b;

edit 2: after seeing some comments asking how the adoption process went, i decided i need to explain some things. first of all it's worth mentioning that the adoption process wasn't immediate and it took about a  year between the time that happy couple found us outside the mall and the time they adopted us. we were in foster care that time and rose use to keep touch with them and they would come visit us once or twice a week(or so im told, i don't know what to believe now)/ eventually rose broke down in tears for them and told them she hates foster care and that her little brother(me) would grow up here and she couldn't bare that thought. at that time they decided to try and adopt her and hired lawyers and stuff and after a few months it was legal and done. at least that what i was told. i don't think my adoptive parents knew but if they did then that story is probably a lie too.

"i (33 f) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 m) and i are indian. he thinks i've cheated, i did not.. t/l/d/r

i (33 f) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 m) and i are indian. he thinks i've cheated, meanwhile i'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

a little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

we've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. so when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

i'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. at first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

i can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! he stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and i'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think i'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

i haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? i'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like i'm drowning.

update: i'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. i had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

i've decided i'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. i'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me. 

many asking for updates, i'll try and come back when the test does. ",8
"my (21m) girlfriend (21f) went on an anti semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. i'm jewish.... update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/beskkf/update_my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

we've been together for 3 months and i had no idea that she held those beliefs. she's always been a calm, ""make love not war"" kinda person and very kind to everyone. this is completely out of character and i'm still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. she sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. when she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a ""dirty ass jew"". i was shocked to say the least and didn't even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. she said that all jews are ""extremely arrogant"" and that they disgust her. 

for the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. neither of us are religious (she's middle eastern) so that's just not something we ever brought up. 


she continued saying that you can't trust jews, that they're all ""rats"" and that she'd rather die than associate with someone ""so corrupt"". i asked her if that's how she really feels and she said yes of course.


i still haven't told her that i'm jewish, i'm not even sure how she will react when i do tell her. should i even bother? it sucks because she's an amazing girl and i'm ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. any advice?

"it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce.. happy update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy\_update\_it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/)  


title may seem harsh so i apologize. also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

bit of background info about my wife: she's an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. so to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

to make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. for the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch netflix in bed. i brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least i could do.

but now it's 7 months later and she's still crying and watching netflix in bed all day. i ask her every day if she needs anything but all i get in response is variations on either ""leave me alone"" or ""some peace and quiet"". virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. i do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. i've suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. therapy. she said that all therapists spew bs back at you.
2. adoption or using a surrogate. she shot down both saying that it just didn't feel right to her.
3. moving to her parents' city. she said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). she snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. again, she said that's too much stress.

earlier tonight i had a talk with my wife. i told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. she said that she's fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

don't get me wrong, i love my wife with all my heart. i'm doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. i know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly i cannot bear living like this for much longer. what do (or can) i do?",8
"32m my wife 33f will not shut up, and i'm not sure i can take it that much longer. is it possible for that to be a reason to leave?. i'm not sure if i should have posted this on instead.  but here goes: my wife will not shut up.  i'm not talking about your usual chatty cathy.  i mean she (almost) literally will not. shut. up.  she will talk continuously from the moment she knows i am within earshot.  not just in the same room.  i mean as soon as it's reasonable to assume that i can hear her.  she will not *stop* talking until i'm gone, and sometimes not even then.  on more than one occasion, i've gone into the bathroom, turned on the loud exhaust fan, taken a leisurely dump, and then returned to hear her cheerfully engaged in the same ""conversation"" she was enjoying before i went in.  she also refuses to *use* the exhaust fan while she's in the restroom because it would prevent her from being heard.  so i get to hear all the bathroom noises on top of whatever homeric epic about her friend's cousin's girlfriend's hairdresser she's blathering on about.  
  
i once drove from tampa, fl to chicago, il with her (before we were married- i'm such an idiot!) without saying more than ten sentences.  she did not stop talking the entire way.  the entire way.  
  
television on to a show i like?  pfft.  that's not a problem.  she'll happily turn the volume down so it doesn't get in the way.  having sex?  that's the perfect time to tell me about how olivia newton john still has the leather pants she wore in grease and she- brace yourself- still fits in them!  really!  needless to say, we don't go to the movies.  ever.  i've been shushed out of too many theaters.   
  
i get it.  she grew up in a huge italian catholic family in the bronx.  if you don't talk loud and constantly, you don't get to talk at all.  i, on the other hand, grew up in a scandinavian family with two children.  to this day, i'm not sure we ever *had* a conversation in our house.  i actually often wonder if that's what made me attractive to her.  i was taught to politely listen to people and then wait for them to finish before replying.  she never finishes (or takes a breath it sometimes seems), so to her i'm paying rapt attention to her no matter how much she talks.  
  
that's not true, though.  another difference between people of swedish heritage is that we don't use ""filler"" words for acknowledgement.  other than the minnesotan ""naaaaah,"" (useful on every occasion!) we're pretty much silent when we listen to others.  no ""uh huh"" or ""yeah"" or ""omg!"" needed.  a nod of the head every ten minutes or so is all you need to convey your attentiveness.  i think it has a lot to with living in the frigid north.  you keep your mouth open as much as my wife does, and your teeth are going to shatter from the cold.    
  
to her, that's like being in the room with a dead person.  she's always stopping to ask ""are you even listening?"" or say ""you never pay attention to me!"" or even quiz me with ""what did i just say?""  i've become an expert at storing the last two to four words she says and parroting them back at her.  she'll be like ""blah blah blah ... and then she told him she wasn't taking that kind of crap anymore,"" and i'll go ""that kind of crap?"" as if i had any idea what kind of crap it was or who it was that wouldn't take it anymore.  and she'll say ""yeah!"" and think i've been paying attention the whole time.  
  
i joke about it a lot, but it's actually getting to the point where it's a problem.  our son is seven years old, and he has developed a pronounced stutter because she interrupts him constantly.  growing up in her house, if anyone paused even for a millisecond, that was grounds for talking over them.  and you talked loud so they didn't finish.  my son apparently inherited some of my less ""staccato"" speech patterns, and she basically just uses that to interrupt and take over the conversation.  it got so bad that he started automatically stopping and restarting words, even when not being interrupted.  i didn't know that was considered a stutter until we went to one of those parent/teacher night things, and a teacher listened to wife and then turned to me and said ""well at least now i know why josh has a stutter.""  just like that.  
  
she's failed at least one job interview because of this.  i know because i lined it up with a business acquaintance myself.  he called me up and said sorry, but he just couldn't take being in the same room with her because she wouldn't stop talking.  
  
we rarely are invited for a second ""couples date.""  she monopolizes the conversation every time we go out with other people.  who wants more than one does of that?  
  
you're probably wondering: ""well, have you *told* her about this?""  yes.  many times.  sometimes jokingly.  sometimes with utter seriousness.  the reactions vary from anger (talks louder, higher, faster, and uses lots more swear words) to tears (she's the only person i know who can carry on a totally unrelated conversation while sobbing hysterically).  the one thing that doesn't happen is her talking any less.  
  
i try not to let it get to me.  she's a very affectionate woman.  loves me to death.  mother of my child.  pretty as the day we met- prettier, even.  we still get plenty of ""alone time,"" (granted, she won't shut up while we're doing it, but i'm pretty busy so i don't really notice as much).  but it *does* get to me.  it's selfish and shows a lack of self awareness.  there's a time and a place for enthusiastic conversation, and they're not ""always"" and ""everywhere.""  
  
i know the answer to the problem: i have to ""talk back.""  in effect, the only thing that possibly *could* shut her up is for me to do the same thing as she does.  i would have to interrupt at the slightest pause.  i would have to talk louder- yelling if necessary- when she tries to interrupt me.  i would have to learn to use italian hand gestures to emphasize my points and chop off her objections.  but i'm not italian.  i'm a waspy pale dude who grew up in a household that would have made a mortuary sound like a middle school cafeteria.  
  
twelve years of this has finally pushed me to the brink.  i'm not sure i can take it that much longer.  i'm just not sure if i could get a word in to tell the judge why i'm there in his divorce court.  my wife wouldn't let me.  
  
tl;dr: wife will not shut up.  is that reasonable grounds for leaving her?  
  
edit: obligatory reddit ""omg i had no idea this would blow up.""  which is true.  i thought maybe a couple of people would just call me an asshole and that would be it.  but rip, inbox.  it was nice to know ya.  so in the interest of not replying to *every* comment, i will try to address some of the common ones and answer some of the questions i saw popping up multiple times.  
  
also thanks for the (often hilarious) advice.  
  
q1 - is this bs? (implied)  
a1 - no, it's all mostly true.  i admit to some embellishment for dramatic/comedic effect, though.  the bit about the leather pants is representative, not an actual quote.  not from sexy times, anyway.  she probably mentioned it at some point, though.  
  
q2 - why didn't you run away screaming *before* you got married?  (sub-question: was op's wife hot?)  
a2 - yes, she is hot.  and funny.  and vivacious.  also, i really *was* a ""nordic silent bear"" (thanks, /u/sarah_dragonfire), my wife drew me out of my shell.  and if i'm brutally honest with myself: when you're young and getting laid on the regular, a lot of things don't seem all that terrible.  damn you, penis!  this is all your fault!  
  
q3 - did your kid really develop a stutter because of this?  
a3 - medically speaking, i cannot state this with 100% certainty.  the cause was never formally diagnosed.  however, i watched it happen first hand.  i'm not a qualified speech therapist, but i think it was a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the observations i made.  i'd welcome a dissenting opinion from an actual professional though, if only to salve my conscience.  which leads to:  
  
q4 - aren't *you* really the one responsible for your kid's stutter?  after all, you did nothing to stop it.  
a4 - guilty.  and i feel utterly like shit about it all the time.  for the record, i did bring it up lots of times even to the point of getting into arguments about it and speaking harshly to my wife when she interrupted my son.  but i think by the time i realized it was happening most of the damage was done.  and anything i could do was more expressing my anger about it than actually making an effective change.  all the rest of this weirdly long post is just ranting.  if there's an actual justification for leaving, this is it (and i'm deathly afraid that she'll get full custody and just make it worse or even irreparable).    
  
q5 - is it because she's (pick one: ocd, insecure, autistic, mentally ill, ...)?  
a5 - i don't think so, although i've always sensed an overwhelming need for attention.  i see it in her family dynamic, in that all of her many siblings were in constant competition for their parents' attention and affection.  
  
q6 - have you tried counseling?  
a6 - no.  probably should have, but i know her well enough that even mentioning it would shatter her.  it's bizarre that i can't bring myself to do a lot of things people have suggested (and believe me, i've probably thought of all of them) because they just seem too cruel to me.  and yet, i'm seriously considering divorce.  i realize the contradiction there.

"update: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving. i will be posting the update here instead since i am still receiving pms to update what happened. i am not allowed to post in relationships (mods told me i am not allowed to post an update thread there) so i got the advice from someone to post the update here instead. this is the post i posted about 2 hours ago on relationship. will try my best to update it as time goes.

here is my previous post for the people who did not read:

click here to see my previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wod49/i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during_her_30f/)

i will try to be as detailed as possible. i have had quite a few pm's regarding what happened and i got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. i want to let you all know that the support i have received has been incredible (both in pm and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

i am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the pm's, theres just too many to respond to but i would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

i would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, i tried to respond but i noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but i still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. much love to you all.

i basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. i cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that i found out before i got married, with no children or attachments. i still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, i guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, i honestly dont know and dont care.

when i was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after i left reddit, she had woken up. she noticed the drinks out and asked me what i had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. i followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, i didnt want to give her any hint of what i knew. she asked my why i had been drinking and why i didnt come to sleep last night and i told her i was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. i felt detached, like i was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

she asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". she got herself done and left for work.

i basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. i planned on leaving things like furniture, tv and other things i really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. i just took the stuff most important to me so that i dont have to return here again. i dont care if she gets the rest. all in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

i called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and i really dont care at this point.

i also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

around 1 pm i called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. i didnt leave any note or pictures at home, i just left. i am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 i start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

the only person i called back was my dad and mom. i have a huge trust for my parents, i basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. i told them its ended, and that i wont be getting married no more. i also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what i told them, i trust them alot so i am sure they wont say anything. i didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that i found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. i just told my dad not to intervene and that i need some alone time now.

i basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

i dont know if i should respond to them now or wait some more? her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). i am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

once again, thank you to everyone who replied. i will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, i know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. i hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

time here is 10 pm soon.

tl;dr found out my fiance cheated and i left without saying anything. not 100&#37; sure what to say or to at this point...

edit 1:  since i still gett messages asking what happened i will leave this edit here. yes i did send the with proof to her sister (the part where the sister is talking about it) to her sister. i have since not received any call or message from the sister. my phone is still blowing up with calls and messages from the ex-fiance. havent read them though, yet. thinking of answering or something but i dont know what to say or do. might make another post later today so i can update you with what happened.

edit 2: thanks once more for all support, sorry i havent updated, alot of things have happened and im too exhausted to write it all out today. i will head to sleep and try to update tomorrow morning with a new post. once again thanks for all support and all comments and feedback, i never believed i could have a community help me in such a big way. i might go for a vacation or something, dont know yet... i will just shortly explain that i really feel like neo in the matrix dodging bullets in slomo, however instead of dodging bullets i have dodged a slut wife, unwanted children with this wife, endless of fights and ton of depression. i honestly feel alot better knowing my life will get better. 
shortly said about her, she has broken down and is begging me to take her back, so is her sister and friends. they also come up with the most retarded excuse of what actually happened (i dont believe them for 2 seconds) and much more... will let you all know tomorrow, going to crash now im mentally exhausted.",8
"my gf is dirty as hell and i can't stand it. so my gf (22f) is one of my biggest blessings in life, but man is this girl dirty as hell. when we first initially met she had told me, but i was like naw can't be that bad... boy was i wrong. 

just a little back story... we have been together for about a year and live together. let's talk dirty:

the kitchen - she loves to cook, but does not clean as she goes. dishes will pile up. trash gets full. unless i clean the kitchen which is basically every day bc i can't stand the mess it will stay dirty. i have talked to her before about how i shouldn't have to clean every single day, but she just doesn't get it. 

laundry - she will pile that shit up and let it pile forever. she be questioning whether garments are clean or dirty. half the time i do her laundry and i have to ask her to fold it. if i don't, she will just add the clean clothes to another basket. 

room- when she gets home from work she just takes her clothes off throughout the room when she could have just put it in the dirty laundry to begin with. she will bring food into the room and leave dirty plates and cups for days. things start to cultivate! 

honestly, i have talked to her about cleanliness and how important it is, but she doesn't get it. i explained that we are now living together and we need to come to some sort of middle grounds. whenever i bring it up she gets annoyed. she will clean the day after i mention it and then never do it again until i bring it up again. ugh. advice, suggestions?


edit: wow this really blew up! i just wanted a little advice so that i could hear different perspectives. some of you provided great advice so i appreciate that! will definitely be talking to her to see what can work best for both of us.",8
"update am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?. edit: his friend messaged me and said i had no right to ""make"" my boyfriend tell on him and refuse to see him. i haven't replied but this does show me my boyfriend is trying 

when my boyfriend got home i told him we had to talk, he agreed. i was going to tell him how messed up this was and i am telling his friends wife but he talked before me.

turns out i don't need to tell her because he already did. she was upset and asked him to never contact her or her husband again, so i won't know where that side is going.

he apologized and said it was a drunken mistake but he knows that doesn't make it right or hurt me less. we had talked about 3-ways before with women and he didn't think i minded, but now understands i didn't agree. he said he never thought he'd do something like that and he attacked me so much when i confronted him because he knew he was in the wrong but didn't want me to think of him as that guy. he was completely remorseful and i even saw him cry for the second time in 3 years. he said he thinks maybe it was some drunken pride thing over not being able to do much with me. this is because he does have some erectile dysfunction problems and i have had to help him with his self esteem as he would often say ""i just want to be able to please you"" when we could only have sex once every few months 

even so, he went to his parents for now. we had moved to a new state together two years ago where they live but i don't really know anyone. i'm looking at plane tickets to my hometown. 

until this incident we have had a perfect relationship. we always hung out and had great times. only once did we ever have a huge fight, little disagreements but nothing crazy. he did everything he could no matter how annoying or hard to help my mental illness. he wanted to pay for me to go back to school. he believed in me and supported me when i started my writing. he helped me come to terms with my abuse and move on. all the nights he stayed up with me while i cried.

i wish this never happened 

i don't know if we'll get back together but he's giving me my space and being respectful. i definitely need to be away from him for awhile and think about this. he says he'll give me all the time i need and if i can forgive him he'll be waiting for me. 

thanks everyone for the help in getting me through this time 

to all the guys messaging me to say it's my fault and i should be happy he wanted to show me off; i hope your dick gets so dry it falls off

edit: just to add about the drinking. we had a problem with this before where he'd get drunk and act very angry/ rude towards me. going as far as insulting me. we talked about it and he no longer drinks regularly. we just drink with friends now so i definitely think that is a big part of it. this was a couple years ago. it also showed me that he is willing to change for the better to keep us going. but this is also a lot worse than just being a drunk butthead

i also saw the conversation and made sure it was between him and her so i know he was honest about what happened with the wife.

"my (24f) co-worker (50f) blamed me for my miscarriage but is now frustrated i won't talk to her. exactly what the title says. my coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because i was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( i took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why i'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but i'm coming and going 'as i please'.


me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that i had a miscarriage. her response? 'i told you you were pregnant! why the hell are you here? you need to be home! this is why you had the miscarriage! you don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. what is wrong with you? you are being so stupid! you don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. come on, really. who do you think you're telling this to? i'm a woman! i have gone through things like this! don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. honestly, take care of yourself. '


and then with that she announced she was going on break and i sobbed in the bathroom. i pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but i've moved desks. i'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. today she tried to send me a birthday gift and i refused. she is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. she also tried to coordinate breaks with me. i, of course, insisted that i break at a different time. 

this is making her frustrated and i am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why i no longer want to engage socially with her. i am completely amicable to her professionally otherwise. how do i explain to her i don't want to be friends with her anymore? is there a way i can do it without causing her to 'explode'?

tldr: worker got upset for getting yelled for being late to work, tried to come up to me and asked me why i didn't get in trouble, i explained that i miscarried my pregnancy and she blamed me for overworking myself and causing the miscarriage and that i shouldn't be surprised if i can't get pregnant again. now, after not acknowledging me for a couple of weeks she came to my desk with a bday gift acting like nothing ever happened and is upset i didn't accept the gift or want to have lunch together

update: first, thanks for the support. i didn't expect this to blow up like it did. yes, we are getting through it and doing okay. 


second, she ended up submitting a false report saying i interrupted her work day and withheld important information. it is false. i have witnesses, i was never alone with her, she had no details on what was held nor did she have any proof and when asked to clarify, she couldn't think of anything. i will update the rest tomorrow as now that she put a complaint on me (and it is very plainly false) it's gotten a lot crazier.",8
"dumped before valentine's day. so.... it's 11:09pm on february 13th. less than an hour until valentine's day. and my boyfriend of 7 years, who i had big plans with for tomorrow, just texted me out of nowhere and said our relationship is over. no explanation, nothing. then he blocked my number and all social media accounts. needless to say, i'm super confused and completely devastated. how am i supposed to survive valentine's day? it's always been our day. we've always done something big and extravagant because valentine's day is our anniversary. and i just feel crushed. some people have suggested i have a girls night, but i don't have really any friends that live near me. and i really don't want to have a night to myself, it just feels so cold and lonely. any advice?

edit: forgot to mention, not that it's super important to this specific situation, but him and i have a 2 year old son together. so it's not just me that this is going to effect, it's going to impact our son's life too.

edit 2: a lot of people are asking our ages and why we don't live together. i'm 20 years old, he's 22 years old. and we don't live together because we were given an eviction notice a few days before christmas telling us we had to vacate the premises by january 1st. it was such short notice, and right at christmas time, we had absolutely no money for a new apartment so we moved in with my parents. he lasted about 2 weeks in my parents house before deciding he couldn't live with them, he said it made him feel uncomfortable. so he moved back home with his family, almost 2 hours away from me and our son.

edit 3: my son was only in this post so people could understand that i'm not just being a whiny bitch because i got dumped. i'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. and please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. that was my decision, not yours. oh, and just so you assholes that were harassing me for getting evicted know, we didn't get evicted for not paying our rent. we got evicted because he invited friends over and they were smoking weed in the apartment whenever my son and i weren't around. we live in ny where weed isn't legal, so honestly he's lucky we only got evicted and he didn't end up in jail or worse, we lose our kid. so i'm not irresponsible for spending money on a trip months ago and getting evicted.",8
"my 29m girlfriend 24f tried to throw me under the bus when the police searched my house. first i'd like to start with some background. my girlfriend and i have been in a relationship for a bit over a year. she stays at my house about 75% of the time. we have had no major problems before this point.

on saturday night, we were watching tv in the living room, and suddenly there was loud pounding and shouting at the front door. my immediate reaction was to call the police, but after a look out the curtains, i found that it was the police.

at this point i was extremely confused. i don't sell, manufacture, or use drugs. i have no firearms in the house. i do nothing illegal online; i don't even pirate game of thrones. i had no idea why they might have reason to be knocking on my door on a saturday night.

i opened the door and they immediately asked for permission to search the premises. i asked why they would think that was necessary, and they wouldn't answer. in turn, i refused to give them permission. my girlfriend repeatedly said i should cooperate. i said no, and told them to show me a warrant if they want to enter the house. they then informed me that they had probable cause and were searching my place no matter what i thought about the situation, and that their asking was only a formality.

the first thing they did after entering my house was pull my girlfriend and i into separate rooms and begin questioning us. i kept demanding they show me a warrant, but apparently warrants aren't even a thing anymore because probable cause can be literally anything when your local pd is backwater and shitty enough. 

i refused to answer any questions. i told them i wanted a lawyer if i was under arrest. i repeated that i did not consent to any searches of my property and repeatedly asked what their probable cause was--that there was nothing readily apparent (thank you breaking bad), and that they had no right to strip me of my privacy. 

my girlfriend, on the other hand, talked a lot. i didn't hear much because she was in the next room but i overheard her say this:

>you should check the back yard shed! i've never been in there before and i can't say what's in it...

at the time i could only think ""what the fuck is she doing?"" well, the police checked the shed, and found nothing (again, i'm not a criminal), and an hour + hundreds of questions later left. at that point i asked why in the world she would try to help them find criminal activity in my house, and she could only answer that she panicked and didn't know what to do.

i don't need legal advice. my mother is a paralegal and knows a lot of good attorneys. she's furious about the police conduct, and she doesn't even know what my girlfriend said to them yet. i'm incredibly angry at my girlfriend for saying something so unbelievably moronic, but all she can respond to me with is ""i panicked and didn't know what to do."" what i need more than anything is another perspective on why a person would throw their s/o under the bus like that.

does this seem like something that can be worked through, or is this just a huge red flag?

"fiance wanted an open marriage, so i called off the wedding. people are asking questions. should i let them know why?. &#x200b;

for those that keep messaging me for an update, it was posted long ago, and it can be found **here**(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/99y261/update_fiance_wanted_an_open_marriage_so_i_called/).

&#x200b;

\-----

&#x200b;

two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

she asks me to go to therapy with her. she was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. that sounded a little weird to me, i thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. i have never met her therapist. so to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

the day comes, and i go there. but out of self preservation, i had my phone opened and recording any audio.

my fiance was already there. i had to wait 20 minutes before i was invited in. the therapist greets me and shakes my hand. we have small talk. she tells me i am not at all the way my fiance described me. i think she is trying to compliment me. then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

that absolutely weirded me out. but i am a calm and collected individual, and i don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

so the therapist starts talking. has a small speech i don't care to repeat. my fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

i smile, i am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind i am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. modern woman and girl power and all that.

nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

the other non-traditional type of marriage. i forgot it's 2018.

but she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

because she would be too heart broken knowing that i find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

so i let them finish talking. they were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because i wasn't saying anything. this was definitely something they have rehearsed.

i then asked the therapist if she is licensed. this, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. she said yes. so i told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

i wished them good luck, and left the office.

now, i want to report the therapist. i am not sure if i have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? i don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and i want her to pay for the misconduct. that ""session"" did not sit well with me.

to be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where i could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. that's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

it also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. now that i have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

so i was a fool anyway.

i listened to the recording, and i still can't believe what was said there.

anyway, i called off the wedding.

i am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because i am not seeking them. there are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. that might have given my ex the impression i will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. having listened to the recording a few times, i am confident the therapist recognized i am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions i am not comfortable answering.

how do i navigate this sea?

i am sure my ex is doing damage control, but i have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, i will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

but my parents and family also want answers, and i am not sure what bs to tell them. i don't want them to think i am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

she is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""we can work on this"", ""i didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

last cry of a dying siren. all her cries fall on deaf ears, and i am the owner of said ears.

we were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but i cancelled everything.

i basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. i had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once i figure out where to do it, and what to say.

this post is mostly a rant, but i would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. my ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and i don't want to be a he said / she said. i do have the recording, and am wondering if i should send it to the interested parties.

my ex doesn't know i have the recording.",8
"i (21f) had sex with a guy i met on tinder last night (25m). to me it was entirely consensual but about 10 minutes after he was crying and telling me i took advantage of him while he was emotionally vulnerable. what in the hell do i do?. i guess some background is in order, i met this guy on tinder about two weeks ago and we sort of chatted back and forth, we had a dinner date on wednesday and agreed to meet again on saturday. i did know that he had a recent break up but he told me over and over again he was ready to get back out there. 

so last night we had a great time. we ended up going back to my place and one thing led to another and we had sex. the sex was actually really good and he did most of the ""work"" so again i had no idea he wasn't into it. so after finishing i was just telling him hat i really liked him and would love to do it again but the mood just somehow just changed. 

at first he started saying he shouldn't have done that. i was like ohhhhhh-kay but whats done is done so lets just go back to being chill since we both enjoyed it. then he started crying and started basically verbally attacking me that what i had done was the equivalent of ""male-r@pe"" and that i knew he was vulnerable but i'd pressured him into sex anyways. i told him that i was really sorry but i saw it differently. he ended up getting dressed and ran out. he was crying so loud and so intently i could actually hear him in the parking lot outside my balcony sliding glass door. 

he drove away and i haven't heard anything from him at all. i am so lost as to what to do. 

1. should i call him and apologize? even though i feel i didn't do anything wrong?

2. should i call him to check on him but not apologize, and maybe just explain my side of the story?

3. should i just swayze him and say i've dodged a bullet?

4. should i actually contact the legal services department at my school in case he was serious about the ""male r@pe"" allegation?


thank you so much for the help!! i'm so lost!

tl;dr: was basically accused of taking advantage of a guy i met on tinder. i'm lost as to what to do next?
 

edit as of 840 az time: he just called me. he was very stiff and said he wanted to talk about last night. i said i wasn't comfortable with that and very confused. he kept trying to goad me into talking and i asked sort of joking ""what are you recording me or something?"" and then he hung up. something tells me i stepped in a huge pile of shit. my dad is paying for me to consult with a lawyer first thing tomorrow...wow that was a hard conversation to have. 

well if i become the first female #metoo you saw it here first. 

edit2: you pathetic little mgtows and mra incels can stop saying ""if the genders were reversed"" or see this as some sort of ""get em guys"" cause celeb. it's been said already. morons.


so awesome this post is bringing out the best of everyone in private…

"update i feel like my white boyfriend is mainly with me for the novelty of being with a ""pretty black girl"" and clout.. we didn't get the chance to see each other all week, but we managed to link on saturday. i wanted to speak about things in person.

i didn't want to go in all accusatory so i just started to say how i feel (it's a good idea who knew lmao). i talked to him about how hearing his friend stereotype black people, and my boyfriend laughing and agreeing with him made me feel.

how ""cool black kids"" were a prop for them at their partners. just a source of entertainment and that upset me. they let them in with the expectation that they'll dance and turn up in a way that'll make the party cooler. there is always a moment at these parties always have the black people dancing in a small small circle doing their thing and everyone else surrounds and sc them. it's like a show. i thought it was a coincidence until i knew it was kinda...orchestrated? black guy walks in and they throw them the aux. not to mention there were no black guys in the frat or in any of their inner social circles, but they love to have them around to dance for them. i told him that i didn't even want to get into letting ""hot black girls in"" hoping they'll twerk. but i talked about how it felt like that's how he saw me. he listened to me the entire time without jumping in and i've never had someone do that before so i appreciated it.

he spoke and said that because of where he grew up, he was used to tolerating fuckshit. that's just how people talked around him and way worse behind closed doors. but never spoke up or anything and he thought that was cool as long as he wasn't saying it. he sees things differently than i do sometimes, but being with me, he's trying to do better. also that, choosing who gets into a party and who to hook up with is purely superficial. but you can't be with someone for almost a year just because they have a pretty face. then we talked about why we were with each other and i won't get into it, but it was really sweet and emotional.

then we started talking about the ""drip or drown"" for guys and **""if she's not a nine, she stays outside""** for girls.

we both agreed it was an awful way to talk about people. he was frats parties are superficial, and so are clubs and they let people in the same way. but the more people want to get in, the higher the standards get. at the end of the day, they can let in whoever in they want. it's their home and they don't have to make it available for everybody if they want to.

his dad was in a frat (his cousins too) and his sister was a sister. it offers a life-long brotherhood, networking and advantages for the field he's pursuing. plus, they're just fun to be in.

so everything worked out and we're just taking things day by day.

also people got so mad because i called myself pretty. women are told to accept compliments all the time, but i do it...it makes me conceited? i'm hella pretty and i know it. stay mad.

but to everyone else, thank you so much for the support and advice.

**edit: guys i read the comments and i'm more confused...i really thought that we had a mature conversation and he promised to better, to call out his friends and tolerate it anymore. he listened to me and i thought all i could do is wait until i see if he follows up. he seemed genuine and i do give him the benefit of the doubt. but maybe i shouldn't...idk here.**

**i've never dated outside my race and i have mostly black friends, so i've never been in this position before. i came here to get different opinions and i did. i guess what i'll do now is watch closely. i really didn't see things this way and thanks for the input and guidance.**",8
"(update to) i 32m was going to propose to my girlfriend 30f until she told me she's pregnant. i was thinking i'd edit the original post, but i decided i'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. since the original post really blew up i don't think too many people would see an edit, so i'm making a new post instead.

i took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the obgyn visit. the iud was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not ectopic. however, a miscarriage is more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. it's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. i ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. we sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. eventually the sun began to set and i decided it was time. i started to say i had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. she told me she understood so i skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. she said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. after we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (i knew she used reddit but i didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. she said she would have preferred i proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, i am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. we're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. we're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage ~~license~~  certificate (thanks for pointing out the difference) in the next few months like someone suggested.

these past few days have been a roller coaster of emotion. thanks for helping me get over my worries.

edit: eptopic -> ectopic.

edit 2: marriage license -> certificate.",8

i showed up to the house while he was at work. (i have a key and my mom was there so this wasn't an issue.) when he got home a few hours later he nearly crashed into my car out of excitement. 

we said hello. i asked him if he liked my shirt. he kind of confusedly said yes. i told him i got him one too, he laughed and got up to grab it. i unfolded it so he could see what it said and he just about stopped breathing. then he took it and went into the kitchen, pretty clearly because he didn't want us to see him cry. 

he's still wearing it. he only took it off for a day because my mom told him he had to wash it. :)",8
"my family is mad that i don't want my heroin addicted cousin at my wedding. for starters, i'm already married and my husband and i are planning a ceremony and party for the family as we got married without anyone present in city hall. 

we're trying to keep it small, 50 to 60 people and honestly i have no relationship with the cousin i speak of. but i made it clear to my mom as she was asking me about other family members that he absolutely was not to be there.

my cousin showed up to my three year olds birthday party high as a kite. falling asleep standing up and looking like absolute shit. my aunt brought him. i was absolutely bullshit that she would bring him around not only my kids but her own grandchildren as well. he has stolen money at almost every family gathering we've ever had. 

why the hell is my family mad at me for it? i don't want my kids around that and i damn well don't want the topic of our wedding to be what is wrong with my cousin?

i took the advice in the comments and confronted him in front of his family by making a „joke"". at first there was silence till his brother made up a fake laughter to calm the situation as you literally could feel the tension. my husband just gave me a poisonous look and didn't say anything. later at home it became a huge fight were he hold a speech about his „role as man"", „his proud"" and that i were unable to be a „good ,caring wife who supports her husband"".
as i didn't shut up this time he told me to fuck off. i took a few things of mine and went to my parents'. i can't believe that he changed to this person as i met him as a open minded man. and i can't believe we were trying to have a baby together. i'm glad i could opened my eyes before it went that far. i'm going to divorce. my parents are thinking that it's a temporary situation but i don't wanna risk a life in abuse and handcuffs.

the same thing happened a second time the day after i posted that, so i went along with the suggestion of filming myself while i sleep, and did that starting just over a week ago whenever i napped during the day/evening.

&#x200b;

long story short it clearly is my brother, i've got him doing it on film twice and thats without even filming myself at night. i have no idea how to even start to talk to him about this, or if i should just stay quiet and try to sleep less until we're back to separate bedrooms.

&#x200b;

edit: i didnt expect so much advice! i'm going to read everything. and for those asking, my brother's a year younger than me. so i'm quite worried about having the video at all for the reasons some people pointed out.

&#x200b;

2nd edit: i want to thank everyone for giving advice, even if a lot of people seem to be arguing about what's best and how serious it is etc. some very calm sounding people have suggested i speak to my brother before anything else, so i'm going to do that. i know some others have warned not to do this, but i think its important to speak to him first. if it goes badly with him then i can still speak to my parents or someone else, but if i speak to them first i can't undo it.

i'm still getting comments and private messages asking a lot of the same stuff, so - i'm 14, he's 13. as for why i 'let him do it a second time', well i do still have to sleep, and i kept recording myself until i made this post and people pointed out why it might be such a bad idea. also a lot of people asking how i know what semen smells like. how do you think? calm down and stop calling me names.",8
"*update - don't want to have a ""click-bait"" title - wife's wedding band(s). **\*\*\*original post\*\*\***(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8kigy/cant_wait_until_thursdaymy48m_wife44f_is_going_to/)

so, i have just returned from lunch, where my wife received her new bands.  we kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  what we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  while ordering, oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is astounded, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  youngest son says he can fix that and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""wtf is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  she is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, i take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits perfectly on her finger, and she has quite literally had enough!  she finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until my oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and i place the next size on the table.  at this point she's just staring at all of us, and i explain what had happened, and how i was able to find the jeweler, etc.  i even showed her the reddit post.  she didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

she (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have killed me if i had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.

so, about the jeweler.  they responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  the oldest son is making jewelry and doing repairs only to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  they sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  i followed up asking if there was any way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""texan"" gift package and sending it to them.

and that's it.  she is extremely happy and overjoyed.  i am really glad it's ""over"" as i had no idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent silver, gold, and platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.

***edit - i keep reading comments about the jewelers, and this being fake.  the daughter, son, and an uncle are all working part time to finish work that was commissioned prior to their fathers passing.  from what was explained to me, none of them were, are, or plan to be in the jewelry business.  so, take that however you want, i have tried to be as genuine as possible, and have zero reason to be dishonest.  i really do feel sorry for the cynical way some people live life.  follow the old adage ""if you can't say something nice.....""

tl;dr - took wife and sons to lunch, pretended to try and fix her band, sons helped in the scenario, wife was finally presented all three bands that were sent, and told about what had occurred.",8

modified post

throwaway account. indian here.

background

mine was an arranged marriage. met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. got married 2 years back. we are both from bihar. both educated. living in a metro city currently. we got along just fine.

my wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. we were having sex for just its sake. slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. no issues there. i always suspected something was off with her. one day something happened after which she got very emotional. i consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(i didnt ask how many times). her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. she just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. she said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). she didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

after 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. all these things stopped after fixing of marriage. she said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . i wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. think about family honour. what would relatives think if it got out.. it happened to me , not you. i dont want it to come out. past is past... all emotional storm.

this all happened 1.5 years back. from then i made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. always with me. we get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

now present problem :

we had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. but i don't want my baby to go even near that man. she is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. okay fine. nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. but just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. i cant let that man even near her. not now, not ever. i dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, i would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. just the thought of him touching my innocent child, i cant handle it. i dont know what im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? what should i do now ?

&#x200b;

**update**

the unequivocal suggestion i got from here was that i should not let her go . i called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. they understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that i can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). so i have to come up with a different solution. and that was of confrontation. i sat down my mil, and my wife and told both of them that i don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. first she tried to act aloof, but i maintained my strictness and told i don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to your daughter, and i will not let him do it to my daughter. period. get it through your head. after i made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, i won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. i again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. there was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. you could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... nobody could fake that.

i went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. that evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my mil had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. so i made my demands :

1. i only got leave for 1 week only, so i would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and i would return. not a day more. she would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. i would get return tickets beforehand.
2. she would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time
3. she would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my fil, or i would publically make a scene, i won't care who is saying what. i would take my daughter from him and leave. period.

she was reluctant for the 3rd point, but i was adamant. she finally agreed. next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and i was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama).

for my wife part, after my mil left, i told her that im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. it's a coping mechanism. (didn't tell her i posted it online, or used the words like ptsd). she got defensive again. someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. was worried about it too. told her she need therapy. now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. i don't know, maybe she was hormonal. for 2 days she was pissed. and was definitely not ready to talk about it.

well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. i think here i did something of a fuck up. after normal checkups, i told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. i was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. i was sitting outside thinking i had fucked up the whole situation. but when i was called inside, my initial instincts were right. the doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). she referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. situation with my wife is tense now. she has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. we are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. i guess my mil will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. now i'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown.

we are leaving this weekend, hope i don't have to face any more drama there. will update if anything happens.

"my sister(f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even if my mom(46f) is pressuring me to, for families sake.. i made a post yesterday but forgot my password so i made a new alt.

okay so i am a huge marvel nerd. the kind of nerd that cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. mostly fanservice.

my sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". she claims i am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

besides that we have a good relationship. we are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

so 3 years ago i managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the usa and meet the real stan lee! he signed one of my own pictures i did of the big 3 and complimented it. it's was one of the best days of my life.
since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

flash forward. a few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and i tell her no. reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. she pouted and i left the house.

when i come back is see my fucking stan lee autograph ripped up on the flor! i fucking lost it. then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). when she saw that i was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that i can get a new one.

i pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. she tries to engage in conversation but i shoot her down. she tries to bribe me with movie tickets and i tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. she hasn't apologized for it. she just says that i should be over it by now.

my mom says the same. she says a materialistic things shouldn't come in between family and that i should simply let it go. my dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. he is as big on marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. this whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

my mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and i think they both disrespected me. mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

i feel awfully guilty but also raging mad. can somone help me with this?

edit :thanks guys for listening to me. i feel a lot better. i will take what many of you said and i am going to send them examples of how much stan lee's autograph costs. but i think i have to word it very good so that they don't think that i would ""split up the family over money""

update : thanks for the support. my dad and i found somone that restored pictures and we are taking my piece to it. dad is going to use part of the money he was going to gift my sister for her car down-payment. as you can imagine sister threw a fit and is staying with mom at my grandparents now.",8
"update i(28f) feel an irrational jealousy towards my son (3m) when my husband (31m) gives him lots of attention/affection. should i discuss it with my husband or will he be creeper out? has anyone else dealt with this?. ok, i know this is an update no one cares about but i'm just so happy with what happened after i got advice here and i just need to tell someone hehe. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cd3zy5/i28f_feel_an_irrational_jealousy_towards_my_son/).

&#x200b;

so after flip-flopping about the issue a lot, i decided to just tell my husband (in a non demanding and non accusatory way as adviced by reddit) and honestly he was so understanding and wonderful about it that i now wonder why i was ever worried. he reassured me that i wasn't a horrible person and that he still loved me and that i just had a little problem that i needed help with. we're now looking for a good therapist for me. already seen one, going to see two more before deciding which one is best for me and take it from there. i can't wait to work through this so i don't have to feel the way i do or at least know how to deal with those feelings better.

thanks to everyone who gave me advice before :)

edit: thanks everyone for your kind words! reading these wonderful comments really made my day. honestly i didn't expect this to get so much attention, i was just very excited and felt like telling someone, anyone :)  even though i cannot reply to all these lovely messages, i truly appreciate them. thank you so much!",8
"middle schooler here- how do i stop my mom from posting my entire life on facebook?. this is on a throwaway because my mom knows of my main account.

ever since i was born, my mom has posted literally every aspect of my life on her facebook account. everything. every baby picture, every ""first"" moment, every accomplishment and every failure. if we get in a fight, she's on fb asking for advice. 

for the past couple of years i've tried to install an ""ask me first"" policy, but since i don't have a fb account of my own, this is hard to monitor. i can only really tell when i manage to get into her phone. the last time i did this i saw some.. grade related stuff. 

i feel like i have absolutely no privacy. i can't talk to my own mother for fear she'll post it on social media. i'm her child, not her dog, and i'd like to be treated as a human being. however, i love her and honestly think she is an awesome mom. this is pretty much the only thing she does that annoys me. 

tldr: my mom didn't respect my wishes and stop posting personal things about me on facebook, how do i get her to understand how violated i feel?",8
"was i raped. i've been seeing my girl for the past 4 months. shits been good but yesterday she had sex with me after saying i didn't feel like it. that day i worked a 14 hour day and had been up at 5 am, i was super tired. i went home and she wanted to play so i just complied at the beginning and just did some foreplay. i started to eat her pussy but i was legit falling asleep so i told her i'm too tired and all that. so i went to use the bathroom but she pushed me back to the bed, and was like i want you in me now i said no. she then just pulled my shorts off and rode me, i just froze i'm a pretty big dude close to 200 pounds and she's like 110 but that day i was to tired to do anything. after i came i felt really fucked. 
am i overthinking things or nah i feel like i'm partly responsible for playing with her and drive her over the edge but i feel really weird now. ",8
"my (29f) husband (31m) is no longer attracted to me after an accident that burnt my face.. my husband and i have been happily married for 6 years and he has been nothing but a kind, attentive and caring spouse whom i love very much.

i attended a christmas party hosted by one of my friends where someone who had too much to drink decided to set off fireworks indoors. i was stuck on the first floor when the fire broke out and suffered third degree burns to my face and chest.

my husband has been extremely supportive and caring, helping me through all the hospital visits, the surgery and taking care of me while i recover. i just cant look at myself in the mirror as my face looks really bad and disfigured and i can tell he feels the same way too even though he keeps reassuring me it doesn't matter. he just looks differently at me now.

the other night we tried to be intimate for the first time and he just couldn't get it up. he kept saying he was sorry and that he still loved me very much but he cant help it. i know he meant it so i just cried myself to sleep that night.

the next week we tried again and the same thing happened. he then told me he wasn't attracted to me anymore and that he couldn't help it. it was soul crushing to hear that. he tries though. he cuddles me, hugs me, and keeps telling me it will all be all right.

is there anything i can do to make him think i'm beautiful again? but how how can i if even i don't think i am?

tldr: i was in an accident that burnt half my face off and my husband no longer finds me attractive",8
"my (20f) boyfriend (20m) invites my best friend (20f) out to games, just the two of them.. my boyfriend(lets call him j) and i have been together for a year and me and my best friend(lets call her g) have been friends since grade school. j and g are both varsity players and are addicted to watching sports. they would follow hockey, baseball, soccer, football, basketball, like almost any game they love. however, i'm not really a sports person but still i would make the effort to attend their games. i would also make an effort to learn and understand their games. j plays football and g plays soccer.

j was using my laptop and forgot to logout his facebook account. i know its wrong to snoop but i couldn't help it. some his teammates were messaging him and i clicked on the message icon and saw that he was messaging g. i got curious and scrolled through it and saw that he invited g out to multiple games, saying that he will buy 2 tickets for this game or that game. g would decline and tell him that he should invite me. j then said that i wouldn't understand and that i was not fun to be with in these kinds of things. g said that he is being unfair to me. j still sends multiple messages to g about wanting to talk and wanting to go out with her.

this has been going on for months. g has said nothing to me about this and the only thing that she did to kinda allude to the situation is to text me list of games that i should watch because those are j's favorite teams.

i kinda feel betrayed by both of them. although i feel more betrayed by j than g.

what should i do? how should i approach this?

**update**: thank you everyone for your advice. i approached g first and told her that i've seen the messages. she was relieved that i came to her and talked to her about it. she explained that she didn't know what to do because she didn't want to do anything that would destroy our friendship. she also assured me that next time she will tell me if anything shady like this happens again and that she will always have my back. we both apologized to each other and hugged it out.

i also have to admit that snooping through j's messages are wrong. the reason i did that because there are some rumours that he hits on other girls at away games and i was feeling insecure and worried about it. but it still does not justify the way i went about it.

as for j, we will meet up later tonight. i honestly think it is over between us. he also has a lot of guys friends to go with him to games and he also would never invite me. i would rather salvage my relationship with my friend, than continue my relationship with him and stay feeling insecure.

thank you people of reddit for the advice.

**update 2**: g told me that i should start by saying ""hey, g told me that you were inviting her out to games"" and i did exactly that. j became defensive and told me that he never invited her. i told him that i saw the messages and he asked if g showed me the messages. i told him the truth that i saw it through his fb and he was furious at me. he told me that i violated his privacy and i apologized for it. then he told me that he was asking out g because his friends felt that g was a lesbian. he was trying to get proof by asking her out and that her not reciprocating is proof that she is one. at this point i'm like ""whaaaaat?!"". he said that he was doing that to protect me and i'm like what?. he then left and told me that he needed space and that i should text him after i got my head cleared up. i texted him ""stay away from me and g"". that was honestly a wild ride.",8
"update my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/)

hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure i owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. plus i've had some time to calm down. i probably wont reply to comments because otherwise i'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

if you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... and your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. it's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while i was at work. this was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. i dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. i'm not sure exactly what i was expecting her to say, but i genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

when i get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. not an apology. an ultimatum that if i went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering i owned the house before marrying her...)

i asked her if she was serious. if she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. yeah, okay. at this point i remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. i asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. i kept pushing her and she kept saying no. finally i told her that i had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  i explain that if i find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, i'm divorcing her immediately. she immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""only"". fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). i tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. she wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. i mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but jesus christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

i feel like i don't even know my wife. the woman i thought i married had some fucking empathy.

she still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. i explained she no longer has a say in the matter. had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, i would have listened to them and taken them seriously. but by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

i told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or i would call a divorce lawyer. i also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether i meet with this girl, but i would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

a few hours later she ""apologised"". i say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. but whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. so we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

tbh though, i don't think i'll ever see her the same way again. so i have doubts our marriage will last.",8
"update: i 22f broke up with my 34m boyfriend (7 months ago) because i found an engagement ring. he came to my work today and proposed. help me. please.. first of all i'd like to thank everyone for their input on my other post. i know it was all over the place and at first i was on the defence in the comments and refusing to see the situation from any angle other than my own, but as time when on and i got more responses/messages, my point of view has shifted. thank you for really persevering with me and helping me to see it from a different side. i really appreciate it. 

if you kept up with the last post and followed it to any extent, then you will know that i was meeting with my ex after work today to discuss the whole proposal and to discuss the whole relationship in general. well, i did. he came to my place after work. and i'm crying as i type this, because the majority of you were right about him. my heart feels broken and i don't know what to do from here. i can go into a lot more detail on this post as opposed to my last one, and i can clarify things more now because i'm no longer defending him. this post is gonna be a very long post so, i'm warning you now you may be here long.

when he came around to my house, my best friend had came too for support and she went upstairs and kept the bedroom door open to make sure that if i needed any help then i could get it. he was not happy that she was there, i told him that's the only way i'll speak is if she's there because i don't think being alone together is appropriate.
first of all, he went on a tangent about how i should never of made that post and that i was stupid to do it, he's asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because i changed the password to the account before i made the post he's extremely angry he can't take it down. he was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
for those of you who didn't read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

first of all it started with a tumblr where he would post the content we'd make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me reddit accounts where he'd have me post any sexual experiences we'd had together or sexual experiences that he'd planned for me. most of which, i weren't comfortable with. i mentioned last time in the comments he'd use phrases like ""if you love me, you'll do it"", ""you know how happy it would make me"", ""you'll enjoy it"", ""vanilla is boring, you don't want me to be bored"", and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there's more. he'd use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he'd involve his friends, have us do cnc, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. the public posting of the experiences got him off and i wanted to make him happy.
and before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which i'm posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. stupidly i didn't question his intentions and i know i was naive, i just thought as i hurt him it was the least i could do. obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

we spoke about our sex life, and i asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew i was apprehensive, and he denied it. said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought i would enjoy all those things and i'd want to do them with him because the thought i would want a 'healthy' sex life (his words). honestly, by this point when he was talking i could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. just from that, i started to feel a bit more sane and like i could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. i was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said ""you should consider yourself lucky that i've not put any of what i have on you on social media, i could ruin your life but i choose not to because i love you and i'm not that type of person""
like, fucking really? who even says that? that's such a passive threat. so, now i'm expecting that to happen some point soon.

then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. i told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 months of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. i told him i didn't want to marry him, or even be with him now. he didn't like that, and got aggressive with me. told me i'd never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because i can't have kids so i'm useless to most men so i should marry him because he ""loves me more than life"" and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he's in charge. 
i kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? and his response was ""you did for 4 years"". so, the majority of you were right, to him i was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn't love me. and all of this actually hurts, because i genuinely loved this person, and now i'm confused about how i could've been so naive to not notice anything. part of me thinks i was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that i missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

i gave him the ring back and told him i don't want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn't working. literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and his arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he'll buy me whatever i want (i've never been financially dependent on him, i have my own place) and do whatever i want him to do to make it right. i told him there's nothing i want from him anymore and that i want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. it wasn't poking me in the face or anything, he was 'hugging' (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it'll make me feel better and i'll remember why i love him. at which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he'll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. his face was a picture, he really didn't like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

so he said he'd leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. my friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. and that was the end of that.
now i'm expecting he's not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, i've asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so i can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
my best friends dad said he'll take me to the police station tomorrow and we'll start a report because he's worried that after what my friend told him that it won't be the last i hear from him, so at least if anything else happens i've started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

thank you for all your advice, seriously. i received a lot of criticism on my last post but i'm thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when i was defending him and in denial, without you i wouldn't of had the courage to end it. i also wouldn't have been able to see it from a different perspective because i was so far under his spell.
i'm pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and i did genuinely love him, and now because i know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish i don't really know what to think, and i feel stupid and like an idiot that i didn't notice it. and now i don't know where i go from here, and i'm worrying he's going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he's really not happy.
i've already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so i'll be starting the healing process soon. i guess i've gotta focus on myself now. i'll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know i won't be going to any events if he's there etc, i've blocked him on all social media, i know he'll be here reading this though because he doesn't need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
i just hope i can get through this.

"i 34m just discovered the real side of my girlfriend 33f. we had no issues before, and she was my role-model. i'm honestly shocked by this.

yesterday i got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the tv and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around christmas time.

after a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating christmas dinner. my girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""look at that crap dinner."" i didn't really react to her comment.

the mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""that looks like cow's placenta."" that's when i sat up and said ""are you serious?""

i told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" christmas dinner, i told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

then she said something along the lines of: ""yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

that was when i lost my shit and just went home. i haven't talked to her since. i'm contemplating whether to stay with her anymore.

any advice appreciated.",8
"should i tell his wife that he is banging hella girls at my job?. long story short. this married guy with 3 kids had fucked probably 5 women at my job. i denied him because he was married. but i did and was texting him there for awhile until he sent me a dick pic! lol anyways wife found my number and text me if i had slept with her husband i told her ""i"" did not. she is asking me for more answers! i want to tell her about her scum bag of a husband then part of me is like is this my place to say?

"shocking my gf sisters boyfriend has a crush on her. i'm 25/m. i started dating this girl 22/f, it's only been 3-4 months, but alot has happened since then.

she has a sister 18/f and her sister has a boyfriend 21/m  who have been together for 6 months. when i first met her sister and her sister bf,  i thought they were cool, we always hung out and even lived together in one room at one point. my gf and her sisters boyfriend got along pretty well, but sometimes i think it was too much. 

little by little i started noticing something weird about her sisters boyfriend. in the beginning i felt that he was too friendly with my gf, like too close but i always thought ""maybe i'm trippin, that's just how they are, it's nothing"" and left it alone. 

then more weird shit happened. 
like one night, all 4 of us went out to a bar, he grabbed my gf and started to dance. nothing wrong with that, but what was weird to me was the way he then started to grab her and dance with her like it was a back in the day basement party. it was weird to me bc she tells me that they're like a brother and sister. brothers and sisters don't dance that way. i ignored that situation and kept it moving.

another time we went out again and right before going in the bar, he decided he wanted to take some pictures. so he gives my gf sister his phone and tells her to take a picture of them. they switch and my gf takes a pic of them two.  the weird part was that if you were to compare both pics side by side and i asked you, which one of these two is he in a relationship with, you would pick the one  he took with my gf. a picture says a thousand words. while my gf was just taking a picture just to take it, the way he grabbed her and looked at her was basically how me, as her boyfriend would grab her and look at her. she posted that pic but deleted it after i said it was weird and people kept asking her ""who's the lucky guy"" .  at this moment i was 80% sure that this kid had something for my gf. 

as time went on and my gf and i got real serious, his behavior towards me started to change. every time i would hug and kiss my gf or show her any affection, i'd feel the hate in his eyes.  he'd mention to my gf how things are different now, how she chose me over her ""family"" (him and her sister). he would make plans to go out to eat but he would make it clear that he just wants them 3 to go. when my  gf would say no, he'd get angry. 

it got to the point where one night my gf sister and her sister bf came over. everything was all good. i wasn't there yet but when i arrived, she mentioned he was being weird towards me. it was like that the rest of the night. 

when they left, i finally decided to have that talk with my girlfriend. we had a long talk about that situation and other things. at first she didn't see things that way i seen them but started to put two and two together. she didn't want to accept the possibility that her sisters boyfriend could want her. she was not convinced but agreed that she might have unknowingly condoned his actions and that she'll be a little less friendly.  

at this time it was 10am, we still hadn't slept. her phone made the notification noise. i looked over at the phone which was next to me, and it read: ""lets fuck"" 

at this moment, we're both in shock. i grabbed the phone and showed her the dm. 

it was from her sisters boyfriend. 

her:  ""maybe that's them playing around"" 
me: ""you don't play around like that""

her: ""it could have been my sister writing that""
me: ""okay then, if that's what you think, let's                  call. if you're sister picks up, we pay attention to how she sounds. if she sounds like she's just waking up, it wasn't her playing games. but if he picks up, you go along with it, to see how far he'll go.""
her: ""okay""

my gf calls, her sister answers, in a groggy voice. like she had just woken up.

gf: ""hey what are you doing?""
sister: ""i was sleeping what's up""
gf: ""where's your bf?""
sister: ""he's laying next to me""
gf: ""look at what he just sent me""
her sister hangs up. 

we call back 15 mins later to give them a chance to talk.

when we call back, gf sister answers. in the background, we can hear that they were arguing. a few seconds later, she hangs up and we don't hear from her again for the rest of the day.


a few days later, they explain that his page got hacked and it was one of his exes that had wrote that. idk how he managed to make his girlfriend believe that but it must have been tough. my gf believed him, but still had her doubts. i in the other hand, don't believe it for various reasons. 

my gf and i spoke about it things and she said that she'll keep her distance. either way i let it go and decided to move on. he would continue to come around but it wasn't the same. 


few days went by. 

yesterday, i call her to talk and see how her day is going. she picks up, crying. she says she's at her sisters house. her sister was being taken by ambulance to the hospital because she couldn't breathe. i tell her to call me back asap. 

time went by and i call to see what's going on. she picks up, i ask her what happened. she says she's home, her sister is doing fine, she's at the hospital with her parents. 

me: ""how come you aren't at the hospital with her also?""
her: ""they wouldn't let us in the room, only my mom and dad, and i was hungry so we left. 
me: ""who are you with?""
her: ""my sisters boyfriend, i told him to come instead of waiting there. ""

at this moment, i am bothered and disappointed. after all that we've been through, you're alone, in a house, with someone that you know i don't feel comfortable with. that's what i wanted to say, but did not say it bc i was on speaker. 

so we continue to talk while she starts to cook. there comes a point where her phone dies. i give her 8-10mins to call me back. (takes 2-3mins for her phone to turn on). she doesn't call, so i call her. no answer. i wait 5 more mins and call again, no answer. i wait longer than 5mins this time and call. she picks up and says her phone died. 

me: ""how come you didn't call back after it died?"" (she usually does right away)
her: ""i was on the phone with my sister, she's ready to leave the hospital, now we have to find my parents and her a ride""
me: ""oh""

her sisters boyfriend finds a ride and leaves to pick them up from the hospital. my girlfriend stays and we continue to talk until she goes to shower. 

she calls back and her sister is there along with her boyfriend. we talk about the situation, and i patiently wait for them to leave so i can talk to my gf about how i felt bothered that she was there alone with him. 

when they finally leave, i express myself to her and tell her how i felt. from that point forward, a 4 hour argument commences. 

- she says that  i have no right to feel the way i felt. that's her ""brother in law"".  and that there was nothing at all wrong with him being alone with her.

i tell her, that i do have the right to feel bothered. it might be your brother in law but things changed when you received that text message from him. i feel disappointed bc you said you would keep your distance. being alone in a house with him is not keeping your distance. 




i'd like to know what you guys think.  am i overreacting? or do i have a point.

"update my best friend (20/m) at the time broke off our friendship 2 years ago because he said i (22/m) made him question his sexuality, and it still kills me everyday. edit: for those who keep asking, or inferring, that we're gay. neither of us are gay or have interest in a relationship between us. we talked, he isn't gay. his worry back then was that he put all his effort into spending time with me, and not into dating and branching out and i trust his word. thanks for all the kind words. 

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvftkn/my_best_friend_20m_at_the_time_broke_off_our/)

i wanna start by thanking users u/maedocc and u/lalee_pop and everyone else for their advice in the comments. they, along with some advice from a 3rd person gave me the encouragement and strength to finally after 2 years reach back out to my best friend at the time. last friday night i drove back to visit my parents, and had noticed that my old friend was also back in town for the weekend. that was when i created my original post asking for advice, because something was telling me that was the time to reach out but i didn't know how. 

i decided to look through a folder of screenshots of stuff we had sent each other years ago, found a funny picture that he had drawn, and decided i would send that. i sent it, and said something like ""wow even 2 years later you were able to tell the future"". i waited, not knowing how he'd respond. eventually he did, and just gave a normal response. so i asked if a mutual friend's house was still the get together spot on saturday's, and he said yeah. he asked me if i was going to go, and i said probably. he responded with ""cool! i'll be there"".

that was the first time in 2 years that we talked for more than a sentence, and he seemed excited to hang out again. i was elated, i got so pumped up. we hung out all saturday and it was like the last 2 years didn't even happen. we didn't lose any chemistry, and we threw old inside jokes back and forth at each other like it was the old times. he then asked if i wanted to hang out sunday too! we hung out all sunday, and things started to feel like it was normal. 

then throughout this whole week while i was back in my normal city, with work, he initiated a lot of texting/snapchatting. that, to me, felt like that was the last step to things being normal. because it showed he wanted to talk to. eventually we both said that we had wanted to reach out earlier but were too stupid/awkward/anxious to reach out. so that gave us a little chuckle. so we basically wasted 2 years because we both were afraid to reach out. now we have been talking pretty much 24/7 all week, and it makes me so happy knowing i have my best friend/brother back in my life. it honestly feels like i'm a different person with him being around. thanks for all the advice!

**tl;dr - reached out to friend after 2 years of silence, ends up reconnecting incredibly easy while learning that we both wanted to reach out but never did out of idiocy and now things are back to normal.**",8
"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to last vegas in january, only to be unfaithful and carry on an affair with a family friend (37m).. this has been a whirlwind of events. i am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

my gf and i have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. this all changed and i no longer know the person i once loved. full disclosure: i have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. she has had the wool over everyones eyes.

in 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to las vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from jan 11 – 14. what could go wrong.

come christmas time, said friend (60f) from las vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate christmas in canada. she has a son (37m). over christmas eve, christmas day, and boxing day, we hung out at this families air bnb house in our hometown and i got to know them very well. i consider myself to be very observant, and i noticed zero interaction between the son (37m) and my girlfriend (24f). after christmas, the family flew back to las vegas and awaited our arrival for the january weekend.

here is where i should have clued in, which i partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. about a week before las vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to las vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a 'girls trip.' my girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn't want me going, but did her best to ensure me i wouldn't have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me i cannot come; accommodations have been rearranged and i'm no longer invited on the trip. given that i had paid for this trip, i was visibly upset. i expressed that i didn't feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something i was invited to. ultimately, she left the decision up to me. i decided it didn't feel right at this point to go unless i was convinced she wanted me there, which i wasn't. friday came and went, she flew with her mom, i stayed home.

my girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (the lie detector test determined that was a lie.) she stayed a few days extra and flew back. she met up with me the following friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. i protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn't right and that we should go our separate ways. maybe one day we would get back together.

this leads us all to today. for the last month, my ex girlfriend and i have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. she has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so i thought). she and i would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. she and i both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. on valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

after struggling to move on with my life i decided today was the day i would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. by pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

i called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he'd allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. him and i got along great and he said i'm always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. she is in banff during her 'busy practicum weekend'. her step-father sat me down and began with this: ""i'm assuming you're here because you don't know everything. if you knew everything, i don't think you'd be here. i have been told by gf, gf mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but i have a lot of respect for you. my ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and i know how it feels. anything you ask me, i will answer completely honestly.""

confused, i sat down where everything had been explained to me. my girlfriend had begun an affair in las vegas with the son (37f) of her moms best friend. every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to las vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to banff with the whole family. keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). i am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. i don't even know how this happened.

i cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. i feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. suffice to say, i am in an absolute state of shock.

i simply texted her saying ""i know everything, never contact me again,"" and my phone has been blowing up ever since. her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me.

i'm completely lost reddit. i thought i was going to marry this girl one day. how does someone change in the blink of an eye. i learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than i did over the course of 3.5 years.

where do i go from here? advice very much welcome.

update: thanks for all the comments everyone. i've read them all and they do show the upsides to this garbage situation. since this shit storm began, my ex returned from her trip and figured out within a few hours who spilled the beans. just to clarify: the step-dad assured me on my way out that he would be crucified for this and had accepted his fate. her house got turned upside down like the circus it is and i've been being blamed for it all. i haven't responded to text/calls from my ex, her mother, or their house. after denying what had taken place, i just assume at this point it will be more lies. she has every reason to lie about it. whereas, the step-dad had every reason not to lie. thanks again everyone for the support and advice. the succubus has been phone blocked and on all social media. 

&#x200b;

**tl:dr** – my girlfriend of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to las vegas only to cheat and carry on an affair with her family friends son. she has been lying to me ever since and has been flying down to vegas and other cities to meet him and stay with him and his 2 kids.",8
"update my (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22m) tried to spike my drink.. this is the link to my original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my\_21f\_boyfriends\_friend\_both\_22m\_tried\_to\_spike/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my_21f_boyfriends_friend_both_22m_tried_to_spike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

after reading everyone's advice and telling my boyfriend, we went to the police station. we spent most of the night there.  i told them about what i saw and that he wouldn't let me go easily when i wanted to leave. they asked me lots of questions: if i am sure, what the glass looked like, what the pill looked like,  how drunk i was, how drunk he was, if i had ever liked him etc. it was very uncomfortable but they had to get all the information.

the police suggested that they take my report to have a file ready but said they can't arrest him or go to his place or check anything as it's too late. they did say it would be a good idea to try to message him and get information from him that would be proof of what he did, screenshots and all. i am not sure if i can do that, he has sent me a message asking how i was that i showed my boyfriend but i haven't answered him yet. i am guessing he's going to start thinking something is up since he has texted my bf who hasn't answered him either.

after coming back from the police, we just decided to get some rest and talk about this today. we haven't yet, we were both exhausted and there was a lot of crying on my part. so that's it for now. i don't want to have to talk to him or face him but i will have to anyway. this is all just so confusing, but thank you all for your support and advice.

edit: i just want to give some more information after reading all the comments:

\-i didn't feel the police was victim blaming, i am sorry if i made it seem that way, but they did explain they had to get as much information as needed and i did tell them everything: there is no history between me and s, we became friends through my bf and common interests and i showed them messages between us, they are mostly about when we're meeting with others and music exchanged. they talked to my bf too and they didn't try to say i made it up in anyway and seemed to believe me. i am in a big city in europe, i guess they are used to dealing with cases like that. the officer who talked to us was very nice and said we reacted very well to this, advising my bf that turning it physical would not be a good idea and even telling me i could come directly to him if i felt threatened by s.

\-i am not makng this up, i have read comments suggesting i did and it honestly hurts. i am not crazy and i never wanted things to get this messed up. this guy was my friend, as are the others in the group.

\-my bf and i aren't telling s we went to the police. i gave my boyfriend my phone to text him as me if he wants but i can't do it. i also showed him the posts on here so he can have everyone's opinions on the situation.

i am sorry to seem this pathetic but it is not the easiest thing mentally. and i am so grateful for the support, i wouldn't have told my bf and let alone the police without it.",8
"i (27m) found pictures of my girlfriend (23f) topless on the beach at night with strangers. a bit of background: my girlfriend and i have been together for 5 years. we have lived most of this time at a distance, because both of us did periods of study abroad, now we live in the same country but different cities , about 2-3 hours of driving away from each other. we manage to spend together almost every weekend, and we were used to much bigger distances when we were living in different european nations, so the distance we have now is no big deal. i'm currently working in my hometown (which is her hometown too), she is still studying for her master's degree and will finish in one year. recently i got a job opportunity in her city and thought it would have been nice to work there for one year and stay together. i didn't previously plan to go there, but i was contacted for a position by an ex colleague of mine and i liked the company. she's renting a house with one male flatmate and i suggested her to leave that house and rent a place with me instead. this was all just to test the ground as i wasn't even interviewed yet, but wanted to talk to my girlfriend before that. she told me she is not ready to live together and wanted me to rent a separate place, she said she would stay often at my place but wanted to keep her own too. given this reaction, i didn't want to move there anymore, instead she insisted that she wanted me to move, but in a separate house. this made no sense for me, because the job was nice but nothing i couldn't find everywhere else, and my hometown is bigger and has more jobs in my field, the main reason i wanted to move was to stay with her. i told her that given that she wasn't ready to share an apartment with me, i would look for jobs in other cities and go where i could find the better opportunity, in my country or the neighboring one. after we had this conversation, she left for 10 days to go on a vacation at the sea with a friend. 

&#x200b;

the fact: when she was on vacation, she partied every night and posted a lot of pictures where she was dancing and drinking. i was naturally a bit jealous but i thought she was innocently having fun. i'm also on vacation by the sea, in a different place, where my family has a flat, and invited her here when her previous vacation was over, so two days ago i went to pick her up at the airport and brought her here. the morning after she was showing me pictures of her vacation on her phone, and while scrolling she suddenly ends up on something she does not want me to see and locks her phone in embarrassment. the only thing i saw in that moment was a picture of her leaning on a guy, and thought that was what she didn't want me to see. at this point i was angry knowing she wanted to hide something from me. we stopped talking to each other for an hour then she came to show me the pictures and apologize. she showed me this picture of her on the beach at night, with 4 boys and another girl, going for a midnight swim. all other people were wearing swimsuits, but she didn't have one, so she was was with her underwear and no bra. she was wearing an open men shirt, borrowed from one of the guys, with her tits out in the open. i don't know the people in the picture, she says they are her friend's friends. i'm heartbroken since i saw that picture and i feel like my entire life has crumbled to pieces. i would have never expected her to do this to me, and i also don't understand why she would be so lacking of self-love to just show herself to strangers like this. i asked her for explanation multiple times yesterday and got different responses. her story is this: she was wearing no bra but wanted to swim and didn't want to wet her t-shirt so borrowed a shirt from one of the guys. she said she closed the  shirt and it just happened that the picture was taken meanwhile she was closing it. this makes no sense because she was actively posing in the picture and making a face for the camera. later she told me that she was upset for our discussions about cohabitation and wanted to do something reckless to forget about our problems for a while.

&#x200b;

i sent her away on a train this morning and told her i want to spend my vacation alone and told her i'm considering breaking up. right before she hopped on the train we both started crying and i held her in my arms for a couple minutes.

&#x200b;

i feel what she's done justifies breaking up, also i'm not sure if those pictures show everything or are just the tip of the iceberg. however, it's very difficult for me to break up. our relationship has been perfect up to this time, we shared a lot of intense moments together, thought she was the love of my live and always loyal to me, was planning everything for a future together. those have been 5 beautiful years and it's hard to imagine my life without her. however, this thing came as a punch to my stomach and i don't feel i can trust her anymore afterwards. is there a way to recover or are we done for?

i'm hating her for what she has done to me, but am terrified of losing her and would feel miserable without her. when i told her i'm considering breaking up she said she would do everything in the world to get back with me, that i'm all her life, and that she's ashamed of what she did.

&#x200b;

one additional issue: we have already paid for a travel to japan together later this year and can't get the money back. i want to go with her anyway. am i being too soft? how should i handle it?",8
"(update) brother (15m) made fake instagram of me (25m) to make jw parents think i'm not gay.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cjkflc/my\_brother\_15m\_has\_been\_lying\_about\_my\_25m\_life/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjkflc/my_brother_15m_has_been_lying_about_my_25m_life/) 

thank you all for your illuminating comments. i'm honestly overwhelmed at the response & apologize for not replying much, it was so much. but i'd like to specifically thank u/\_\_my\_man\_\_(https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) for his comment, which suggested that this was not him trying to rope me back in, but him trying to escape the cult. you were exactly right.

today we talked for the first time since our conversation. he took down the insta after our conversation (which i hadn't noticed at the time of writing the post, haha), and i gently asked why, exactly, he did this. he's fifteen, so he didn't quite have the language to say ""i'm being abused and need to leave the jw."" what he said, instead, was that mom and dad are ""crazy"" and he's become disillusioned with the cult (he even used the word ""cult""). he still believes in god and wants to explore different sects of judeo-christianity. my hometown is a small place in the midwest, and everyone knows who the jw are...they're, like, ""those people"". so he couldn't covertly go to another service without someone recognizing him and it getting back to my parents.

his motive was pretty much what u/\_\_my\_man\_\_(https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) said. he said he wants to visit, hang out, and explore the religions around chicago, but the only way my parents would allow him to leave town is if they knew exactly where he was, who he was with the whole time, etc. so in his head, propping me up as converted was the only way to make it happen. i told him i was completely uncomfortable with that, and that my relationship with my parents is over. he apologized, and pretty much already knew the logistical problems. i think this was a very maturing ordeal for him.

i established myself as a lifeline. i told him that if it ever gets too much, i will pay for his train ticket and he can stay with me for as long as he likes, even moving in for the remainder of high school. (and i mean it: i have enough space, and my aunt will help with childcare/extra expenses). he seemed apprehensive, but the thought's out there, and he now seems comfortable enough to vent about the church/my parents/my crazy ass sister directly. 

as for my parents, i just told him to cold turkey stop talking about me. if they ask (and this was suggested by julie, my ""bride-to-be""), he will tell them that i might have refound christianity but i have no intentions to return to the watch tower, and that he stopped talking to me. leaving jw for any reason is grounds for excommunication. and i put my actual insta on private, in case they go looking. they might think i'm not gay, might now have the sliver of hope that i'll return to them, but that's honestly not my fucking problem. 

and for the guys who suggested this was a honeypot...no. no fifteen year old can act this well. he's so, so full of love and kindness, and as fucked up as his plan was, it was at the end of the day because he is panicking in a toxic enviorment. 

thank you all, again. my brother is back in my life, and i now have the means to help him. thank you, thank you, thank you.

**tl;dr: my brother made the fake insta so he could have an excuse to visit me. i told him if he ever wants to escape my parents, i will be here for him to move in with. the insta is deleted. thank you.**",8

&#x200b;

i wanted to give y'all another update - hopefully the last one. it's been about a year since my original post, ten months since the first update.

&#x200b;

my ex did move out. thankfully, moving day was uneventful, and then he was gone. and as many commentators predicted - when he was gone from the house it was a huge relief. i didn't have to cringe at every little sound anymore. i could breathe again. i was really, really sad - but my space was my own.

aaaand then i got laid off. no joke. helluva one-two punch right there.

the past two years have, on the whole, been incredibly painful. the year that my marriage fell apart, and then the year i had to spend recovering from that blow. i had to job hunt while mourning the death of my relationship, and as soon as i found a new job i also found out my house needed hugely expensive repairs that, after all of this mess as well as having supported my ex not working for a year, i just didn't have the cash for. and figuring out how to be on my own for a while - i had people there to support me, but in the day to day, hour to hour through this mess i was ultimately on my own, and that was hard. (bingeing 'the marvelous mrs. maisel' helped a bit.)

he also kept reaching out. for a while it was occasionally chatty, but as time went on and i came more to terms with how he'd treated me, and how frequently his messages had a tinge of emotional manipulation to them, i distanced myself. he messaged me once to ask if i regretted our entire relationship, on the whole, or if i thought he was a terrible person, on the whole. i didn't respond to that one at all. then he'd reach out with things like ""hey, the tv i took from our living room broke, do you want it from me? like to sell or try and fix?"" i've been doing my best to keep my responses short and clear, in ways that don't invite follow-up. lately he's been wanting to have a post-mortem conversation, to which i said that i wouldn't be ready to consider whether or not that'd be a good idea until our legal ties were ended. (he also just messaged to ask if he could be my roommate, because his rent is really high. i have no words.)

&#x200b;

the good news - and there's thankfully quite a lot of it - the new job i got is possibly the best job i've ever had. a step down in salary, but i'm super happy with the work and the people and the location, and i've been getting rave reviews from coworkers and management, enough that i think i can probably negotiate a decent raise in a few months. i had to get a new car as well (new to me, but purchased used) since my ex got the car we shared in the split, and i was nervous about negotiating and buying a car by myself, which i'd never done before. but i did it - and managed to negotiate the dealer about $1k down - and i absolutely love the car.

also - i met someone new. this person reminds me of my ex in a lot of ways - things like shared hobbies and creativity and sense of humor and charm - but very different in some really important ways. he treats me really well. he's thoughtful and kind and generous - not just to me, but to everyone. in the conflicts we've had (very few) we are able to talk through them calmly - no yelling! - and he shows me how much he respects and cares about my perspective and boundaries and autonomy. he's not broken and doesn't need me to fix him - and i'm not broken either, thank god. maybe carrying a bit of extra baggage, but such is life. this relationship is still new, but it feels like a game-changer for both of us, and i'm excited to see where it leads.

&#x200b;

and one more bit of good news - i will officially be divorced on friday! (yes, the day after valentine's day xd ) there are a few more loose ends to wrap up after that, but not many.

&#x200b;

i wanted to provide this update in part because i know it can be nice to see updates from folks, but also because i wanted to give a bit of hope to anyone who might be in a situation like mine. it can get better. it really, really can. i'm actually happy. it took time and hard work, and things aren't perfect - i'm definitely going to need a lot of time to recover financially, and i'm still sometimes processing the weight of 11 years of emotional abuse (a+++++ for therapy) - but i'm actually truly happy. sometimes i wonder how much of the depression i'd been feeling before he left was the result of how much emotional weight i'd been carrying for so long - his and mine - without truly being aware of it. it's so easy to feel like that dark tunnel is all there ever will be, when you're in the middle of it - but i'm out in the sunshine now, and it feels amazing.",8

&#x200b;

well, it's been like 12 days. the long and the short of it: the truth came out. wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and i am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. i need a stiff drink and a vacation.

&#x200b;

a lot of people said some things that really struck with me. the photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. why would he take a picture that was so compromising? why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? how was he so cavalier? i sat her down and demanded the whole truth. we talked the night that i posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. we went moment by moment, step by step, and i demanded to know what happened. so, here's what *actually* happened:

&#x200b;

they got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. they drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. they got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *get high.* but on what you might add? oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. yeah, fucking lovely. my mil had been on dilaudid, ativan and others. they all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the moh's surprise - a stripper. so, who took the pills *and drank?* only my future wife. yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. it's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. my fiancee doesn't drink, so i should have connected the dots there. that's on me i guess.

&#x200b;

the reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. stripper never fingered her. she kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. the photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. she then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that i would leave her. she said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. she was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. i couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. i thought the pills were destroyed but i guess my fiancee didn't do that - i had no reason to assume she would lie. in the years we've been together/known each other she's drank maybe 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. i didn't think she'd do that.

so, that brings me to the texts. i ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. she explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that i was going to find out and leave her. her moh, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. by this point i didn't know what to do.

i followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. she began to panic and begged me not to. she started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever i wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. she then said she had a problem and needed help, her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. she said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. that i don't actually doubt, i think she really does love me.

&#x200b;

so what happened?

&#x200b;

she saw her doctor on monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. we got the name of the doctor and i guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. he recommended different types of therapy. we had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. she's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. we're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold.

&#x200b;

this meant that i had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. he knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. my parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. my fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. the bridal party & maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. they admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. she drank way too much and they didn't stop her. i thanked them for their apology but said i didn't know what to say. they just offered their apologies and said that i was a great guy.

&#x200b;

the long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. we aren't having sex. we are right now in this weird healing phase. her team has recommended i see individual therapy which i haven't yet had the time to do. a lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, i guess. my parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this.

&#x200b;

fiancee and i are in a weird place. she's overly nice and sympathetic. since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. she submits to drug tests and we have a bactrack if i'm concerned she's drinking. i'm a lot more aware of what's going on. she's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. she's in group therapy and individual therapy.

&#x200b;

i kind of feel like i got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. people keep telling me to watch out for myself, but i'm not sure what to do.

&#x200b;

so that's what happened. i'm stunned and confused. turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. i still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. for now, i'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend.",8
"final post on: i'm a female born without a vagina. how do i tell a guy that i'm interested in about it?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3o3w/im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how_do_i_tell_a/)

updated post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9xps88/update_on_im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how/)

i was going to make this an edit but due to its length, i figured to make it a separate post. i don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but i sincerely apologize if i am in the wrong.

i just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things i've mentioned in the comments briefly. i hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

but before i do that, i want to thank everyone who sent me a dm, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. i've read through all of them, but i haven't gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. you have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much i appreciate it. i love you all <3

# quick update:

i texted kyle yesterday and he replied. i asked him how he was feeling. he said he was even more sick than earlier. i said i was too, and i said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). i told him about how i had a volunteer thing at university which i went to and how i nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. but that was it. we didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

in addition to this, i haven't called the number my ta gave me because they are only open monday - friday from 8am to 4pm. so, i'm going to be doing that on monday, hopefully.

# my condition:

the exact name for my condition is mayer-rokitansky-küster-hauser syndrome, or mrkh syndrome for short. it affects 1 in every 5000 women. a lot of people, i'm assuming they were trolls, stated that i was a guy or something along those line. just to clarify, i am a woman, i look like a woman physically and i've felt like a woman my whole life. i was genetically born with xx chromosomes. being a woman is not something i doubt.

there are basically 2 types of branches within mrkh. type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. this may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. i have type 1. there are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. i am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# diagnosis:

a lot of people were confused as to why i was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did i find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

the way mkrh works is that it affects internal reproductive organs. this means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. from the outside, i look like a normal female. i have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. i am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. my ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why i am still physically able to look like a female. for me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, i have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. for 18 years of my life, i lived thinking i was just like any other girl. i never once suspected anything wrong.

when i started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. but this was around the time i started to feel like something was wrong. one main reason was that i hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that i wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. for some reason, at the time, i assumed periods and fingering went together. i thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. its weird looking back at that now haha.

i went to the doctors one day (this was before i started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. this is probably one of the most common ways women with mrkh find out about it. the doctors simply assumed that i was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. i was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. i was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. the following year, i got my shit together on my own. i joined the wrestling team, track team, and i started doing weight training. as a result of this, i was also eating way more, and i gained a lot of muscle mass. i got my weight up to 120lbs. when i still hadn't gotten my period, i went back to the doctors. they still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. i had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. i didn't feel like everything was normal, so i switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. needless to say, i was getting tired of blood tests because i knew they didn't show anything. one doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but i think that was circumstantial. prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that i had breast discharge which is something i had never experienced before in my life. some how, i can't exactly remember which doctor, i ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. i diligently took the bc pills every day. nothing happened. this is when i thought, ""is it just me or does healthcare in canada suck?"".

then another doctor suggested i get a pelvic ultrasound done. this is when they found the issue. the poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. the doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. she stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom i had mrkh. she said according to the ultrasound i had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). she literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. i walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. his response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and i could hear him. and then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". i came home, and i did some googling and started to learn more about mrkh. i had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and i texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. i also added that if it changed anything between us, that i would understand, and i wouldn't hold it against him. as much as i might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something i really needed at the time.

after the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a sickkids hospital in downtown toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. they started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. they had me get an mri done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an mri. i also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. i ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because i didn't have one. the look on their face was hilarious as i'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. after i met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, i was properly informed that i did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but i was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. i was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. they had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. the depth of it was about 3mm deep. it was actually quite painful, and i hated doctors by this point anyways.

# family situation:

my parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are highly taboo. everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know english well so most of the time when i went to the doctors, i went with my dad. it was very weird and awkward. the few times my dad refused to go with me, i went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

after my last appointment with sickkids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. my dad took those from me and threw them out, saying i didn't need them. they also asked if i would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that i didn't it. going to therapy at the hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. i can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which i don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but i don't have time due to school. i actually got a letter from the hospital in september about a pretty cool mrkh conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. i really really wanted to go. but again, it was far. i figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, i could definitely bus there. the event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. it was unrealistic for me to go. so then i told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. they'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" i tried arguing that it was exactly the opposite of that, and that they want to inform you that you are women despite the lack of certain organs. they responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) i had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

i had someone telling me that i need to stand up to my parents. my parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. unfortunately, due to the circumstances that i don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something i refuse to do. i am well aware of the shitty situation i am in. i know they are being abusive, in more than one way. i've thought long and hard about it, and i've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. i'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. i've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# surgery:

i had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. in my first post, somewhere in the comments, i believe i said something along the lines of ""im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why i can't get surgery yet. lucky for me, i live in canada and i have health insurance! surgery is definitely an option for me. but due to my family situation, they believe that i wont need surgery until after i get married because i mean its not like i'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# additional comments:

1. a lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that i could look into doing anal. it's all about personal preference, and i hate it. its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. i can look into the asexual community, but i am not asexual. i may not be able to satisfy my needs, but i do have a pretty high sex drive, and i do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. i don't know if i would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. a lot of people had a lot to say about how i handled the situation. some saying i did the right thing, and others saying i did it too soon. honestly, i haven't figured out the right way to go about it. i have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. i once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""aren't you surprised i still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" i was so taken aback by it, i didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. someone said that ""if a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, i'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. so he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". true, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his ibs. i didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was relevant to what was happening. i evaluated the situation i was in with kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so i had to tell him. agree or not, first date material or not, i'm going to stand by with what i did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. i am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest i do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. i don't want to publicly display it to guys i'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. i know guys who also use those dating apps, and i don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. the guy i ended up calling on tuesday night, after i left kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. he has told me that it wouldn't bother him. i had a lot of messages telling me that i shouldn't friend-zone him, and that i should give him a chance. here is the real reason why i'm not attracted him nor why i would never ever give him a chance: he's basically doing nothing with his life. he's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. whereas i on the other hand, i work part-time, i study my ass off in school, and i make time to do extra curricular stuff. i also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. but i treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. i'm not saying i'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am i saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. i'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and i'm not into that. in addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. he was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". i was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, i am. there is no way i am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. i think one of the main reasons i even turned to reddit in the first place was because i am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and i don't want them finding out. there was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me i can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications i got.

this is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. i hope i answered some questions. i really do appreciate all the support i got. thank you, and take care everyone <3

edit: i'm only doing this to feel better about myself: kyle replied. ""i definitely do not want to get involved"". fuck you, kyle. if y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. i welcome it with open arms. 

edit: i think i forgot to address this earlier. for those of you asking whether i can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. my clitoris is underdeveloped. stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? i don't know. i haven't tried. 

edit: guys. i. can. still. pee. i have a urethra. you do not put a guys pee-pee in the same place you pee from. simply anatomy. ",8
"update: me (36m) found out that my wife (34f) was cheating on me with multiple men. in my original post i was still unsure what to do as seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me\_36m\_found\_out\_my\_wife\_34f\_has\_been\_cheating\_on/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me_36m_found_out_my_wife_34f_has_been_cheating_on/) 

but after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, i got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. i finally opened my eyes to what i had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that i would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so i decided last thursday to tell her i wanted to end this marriage.

i think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. she didn't even try to persuade me or anything. just went like a broken record ""nothing i say will change anything"" whenever i asked her to say anything. there was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. we have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

my mother knows everything, but i for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. maybe i'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so i agreed to give her time to tell them. when we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. they have been part of my family for almost 17 years and i care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. i felt really bad about lying to them, but i'm afraid that if i go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. but my patience is not limitless. i will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

i don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. i'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". i also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

now there are some big loose ends to tie. we need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. the custody will be shared where i will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. i also feel like their legal address should be with me, so i won't have to pay her child support. would be unfair after what she did. i have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. i will fight for my kids though.",8

"wife died unexpectedly, discovered her affair. my wife died this past week unexpectedly. she was young and healthy, and the illness took her in hours. i thought things had hit rock bottom. she essentially died in front of me, and i was wracked by grief and guilt over her death. 

all things considered, i was coping as well as could be expected. make no mistake, i was going through the expected grieving reactions. i raged and hysterically cried for days. i went numb and then silent, then hysterical again. but i have good friends and i have been surrounded by family from both sides of the marriage. 

in the process of going through her belongings i discovered on her phone that she had been having an on and off affair for the last three years. it looks like she started cheating during a period where i was depressed after losing my job and father in the space of two weeks, both unexpectedly. after mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, i was back at a new job. however, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that i was distant to her. in the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father's death. 

what more can life do to me? this man she was having the affair with appears to be an asshole that may have been abusing her, based on the text messages. he appears to be the exact opposite of me. i am a kind, generous, attractive, and intelligent person with a good career. the logical part of my brain knew that she had the capacity for dishonesty and selfishness, but i could never have imagined this. 

i am absolutely and totally devastated. the only saving grace is that we never had children. i wanted them and she did too, but she kept wanting to put it off. i suppose now i know the truth of why. 

i feel like i will never be happy again. ",8
"i (26 f) used to be a prostitute. then i met a man who became my friend (36 m) at a cafe. now i have my ged and am a receptionist.. i have a child with cystic fibrosis. i would watch him during the day and work at night. my sister lived with us and she would watch him at night. 

i would go to a cafe before i started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself. my friend was there typing on a laptop. we started talking and i found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business. 

i told him i never finished high school and he said he'd help me get my ged. the next day he brought me some books published by where he worked. he helped me study and i passed. 

he helped me get a job as a receptionist.  i can afford better care for my child. 

we are still friends and i have fallen in love with him. i'm not sure if he could ever like me in that way. 

is it worth asking him if he does or not? or do you think that would ruin our friendship?

i'm not sure he would want to be with me because of my past.

"final update - my (24f) best friend (24f) says i owe her everything i have, including my boyfriend. previous post   
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9j5ig0/update\_my\_24f\_best\_friend\_24f\_says\_i\_owe\_her/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9j5ig0/update_my_24f_best_friend_24f_says_i_owe_her/)

&#x200b;

i said i'd come back if anything relevant happened!

&#x200b;

ex-bf kept trying to get in touch through common friends. they kept asking me to unblock him and at least hear him out, cause he was really sorry, he loved me, he was a mess, he didn't mean to, someone even went as far as to ask me if i was really sure it happened. they offered to send me prints of texts where he was talking about me, so i'd see how he always had great things to say and how much he cared. but i've had it with the print screen drama for life, and said no. to the ones who insisted i told them i wasn't unblocking him, had nothing to say or hear, and if they kept pushing me, i'd block them too.

i ran into ex bf at this book thing i go to often (hobby of mine). maybe i'm being presumptuous, but i think he went there for me. he didn't really have any business there, but i'm just speculating really. he asked if i had a few minutes for coffee, i said i was late (lie). he walked me to my car. he looked so good, smelled great. he was so sweet. was even wearing his hair the way i like it. i fell horrible cause even after everything, i still like him. he apologized some more, said he knew i needed time and space but asked if i'd consider giving him another chance cause he would wait for me. said he would never talk to jessie again, and would act like they had restraining orders against each other. and i just found it really funny how everything he was saying required me trusting him. which i don't. so i told him i wasn't interested anymore and he should move on. i wish i said something snappier or wittier. but i had nothing.

this was saturday, i haven't heard from him or friends since. i think that was that. 

&#x200b;

jessie also kept trying to talk to me. like i told some of you on comments, i had a trip coming up, it would have been me, jessie, ex bf, and a few friends. since jessie couldn't afford it, my parents payed for most of her expenses. she must have remembered this right after everything went down and panicked cause i had everything (vouchers, confirmations emails, credit card info...). she went crazy. even showed up at my place (i wasn't home and my roommate told her to fuck off, exact words). i didn't block her at first cause i admit i was having some fun watching her despair.

i talked to my mom and she was amazing. told me i should cancel everything even if it costed us money, it was fine. so i did. and for one last bit of print screen drama: i printed all the emails i got confirming cancellations and sent those to jessie with the word ""bye"" before blocking her.

&#x200b;

my roommate has been amazing. we were never really close and now i don't even know why. she cancelled plans with her friends to stay with me and invited me to go out with them next weekend.

&#x200b;

a few of you suggested i see a therapist and i did, yesterday. i really liked it. it was just one appointment and i mostly just talked, but it felt good. she gave me ""homework"": she talked a little about unhealthy and abusive relationships and asked me to think about my friendship with jessie and try to point what was healthy and what was unhealthy about it. made me realize she was never really my friend. she was taking advantage of me for years and she even had me thanking her for it. therapist also told me about this saying (i think that's what it is) called ""the narcissist's prayer"", which goes something like ""that didn't happen. if it did, it wasn't my fault. if it was, i didn't mean it. and if i did, then you deserved it"", which is totally how jessie is handling this whole thing now.

so good riddance indeed

and a final piece of gossip. ""pete"" talked to me yesterday (he is checking up sometimes, he's a good guy. again, he is gay, in case someone is still thinking this might turn into a romantic comedy) he said jessie was super sure that since i broke things off, she and dean would hook up right away. but apparently he doesn't have the same plans and that freaked her out over the weekend. pete says he really is a mess and went out drinking hard 4 nights in a row to the point he had to be carried home by his pals. and yesterday, they all went out for lunch at this burger place, jessie was going to run her fingers through his hair or something and he just pushed her away and told her to stop and to never touch him again. (great that **now** he manages to do that, huh?)

i guess in the end he really did like me in his sick way. the thing is, i don't want to be with someone who likes me in a sick way. i want to be with someone who likes me in a healthy way. i thin i deserve that.

&#x200b;

i am also thinking about taking the money i got back from the trip to go somewhere else by myself. haven't decided though.

&#x200b;

anyway, this will be the final update on this, since it is unlikely that i will have anything new to add

now, i think i just need time to heal and let go, you know?

i might come back in a few months if there is reason to do a ""yay life is awesome now"" post, but i wanted to post this update now cause i wanted to end this whole story on a bright note. and, of course, thank you all again!! you are the best!!

 tldr it's all good. as well as could be, anyway! thank's reddit!",8
"my 30 m wife 30 f lied to me about where she was yesterday.. update: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al02i9/update_my_30m_wife_30f_lied_to_me_about_where_she

i hate that i'm having to write this but here it goes.

my wife of 6 years and partner of 14 has been studying a lot lately for a certification she wants to get related to her job. she mostly studys at home but will often go to a library or starbucks if she really needs to focus. we aren't the kind of people that are incredibly co-dependent and we each have our own set of friends and time for ourselves that the other understands.

this does require quite a lot of trust as i've found that people that get exceedingly jealous of their partners are usually the ones that are the most dependent/controlling of them. well yesterday that trust was shaken a bit for me.

my wife told me that after work she was going to study and then head to the gym. she has a scheduled class at her gym and didn't want to run all the way home and all the way back in the snow and ice so she was just going to study at the library and then head over.

it occurred to me after a few hours though that yesterday was mlk day and all the library's were closed. no big deal, i figured she'd just go to a panera or something and then head to her class. when she gets home, she's in her full gym outfit but she's still in full makeup and runs right upstairs to take a shower. i asked her how her day went and she said ""it was good. the library was good, i got a lot done and the gym was difficult today which i liked."" i didn't say anything to her about the library being closed and thought the whole thing was odd. while she was in the shower i decided to get on facebook because the gym that she goes to has a page and they put updates with pictures on there for marketing and what not.

there were only 4 people in the class other than the instructor and my wife wasn't in any of them.

i haven't said anything to her about it yet and i can't help but suspect the worst. it is very unlike her to hop in the shower right after getting home like that, she usually eats dinner and then hops in really late at night. anyway, i don't really know what to do or how to bring it up to her without sounding paranoid.

edit 1: i called the library and they confirmed they were closed yesterday. the gym is also really a kickboxing fitness thing and it's only one big room with a bunch of heavy bags - the pics were from when my wife said she was there and she's definitely not in any of them.

edit 2: so i came home for lunch after reading all the messages. pretty much half of you are saying talk to her and the other half saying ""collect more evidence"". so i'm torn. 

i did, while i'm here at the house, peak into her gym bag and found this http://i.imgur.com/dnq74ds.jpg . there are some gym gloves, hand wraps, sunglasses, headphones... and sexy red underwear. i don't know what the logical explanation for it would be other than the obvious... this sucks. 

morning update: wow... so thanks to everyone who reached out about this. it was impossible to read all the comments and reply to every message but i really appreciate it.

i decided not to confront my wife about this last night and instead confide in my best friend who i've know practically my whole life. he was on the ""wait it out, collect evidence"" bandwagon. i haven't begun to do that yet but i will in the next few days.

last night she did tell me that she was going to do the study/gym thing again today and would be back around the same time as monday. again, this is somewhat typical for her. i have a second job that i work tuesday / thursday and so m/w are usually her gym days. what is a little strange is the studying away from home again. she does is sometimes but it's rare and i can't remember when she left to study back to back away from home. she gets off work around 3:00 each day and the gym class ends around 7:30, so she's got 4.5 hours to do whatever if she wanted. 

addressing some of the most popular comments from the comment section.

1. ""how do you know that she wasn't just at a boudoir thing"". i guess anything is possible, we don't live in the largest town and there is only one place i could find online that even advertises that they do stuff like that. i doubt they would give out any information but it just doesn't seem realistic that this is the answer. that's a lot of trouble and lying to go through just to take some pictures. the other part is that i am going out of town this weekend, leaving friday night and returning sunday and she will be all alone to do whatever she wants. if she was doing a boudoir thing she wouldve waited until my trip that has been planned for a while and not do it on a holiday.

2. the gym photo. i do know the photo is from monday 100%, there are hashtags and other things on the facebook post that solidify that. i also checked their instagram later and there were more pictures from monday as well. however it could be from a different time of day as you guys have suggested and not when she said she was there.


i will say for some added context that she has seemed different the past few months, especially sexually. i don't want to get too graphic or anything but she's kind of become fixated on doing new things and being more provocative. i honestly feel like an affair is the only answer. that's all for now, i might update in a few weeks if anything changes. thanks guys. 

oh and shoutout to u/vh3m for saying she couldn't be cheating because ""she is fat and no one would want to sleep with that hippo."" you sound nice.

"my(24f) coworker(50f) blamed me for my miscarriage (update). it's been a long day. first, i want to again thank everyone for their love, support, and advice. i wasn't able to answer everyone but know i tried to read all of them. thank you.


so, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. now, yesterday i was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. she did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. she saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming i wasn't working. what she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'i still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him i wasn't on the application and i wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


my boss calmly assured her that i was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (i get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong i guess, doubled down and was upset i hadn't communicated that to her. i didn't even know. my boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and i guess they talked in circles for a bit. he let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. she had nothing. 


when i spoke to my boss, at this point i was upset. i finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. he was not pleased. he did let me know i don't have to explain myself and that next time if i'm in that situation to go straight to him. he offered his condolences for my loss.


as for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. she has a laundry list of people to ask before me. he told me to document everything. anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


today, she hasn't been around me. she even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. she hasn't said a word all day. it's been a wave of relief for me.


tldr: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. she is now not allowed to speak to me.

"by buying everyone an ancestrydna kit and ruining christmas. earlier this year, ancestrydna had a sale on their kit. i thought it would be a great gift idea so i bought 6 of them for christmas presents. today my family got together to exchange presents for our christmas eve tradition, and i gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

as soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. she told us how she didn't want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. we explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

fast forward: our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

tl;dr i bought everyone in my family ancestrydna kit for christmas. my mom started freaking. now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

update:  thank you so much for all the love and support. my sisters, brother and i have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. no matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

update 2: christmas isn't ruined! my fu actually turned into a christmas miracle. turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. a good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. they never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. this is a christmas we will never forget. and yes, we are all excited to get our test results. merry christmas everyone!

p.s. sorry my mom isn't a whore. no you're not my daddy. ",4
"by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.. the overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. i bought a replacement bulb but when i put that one in it was also barely lighting up so i realized the unit was bad.  

the fan still worked great, it literally is the best fan i've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. the fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so i didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


so since then over the years my wife and i have had to make due with no overhead light. we open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. it's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so i keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

after 6 years of living in the dark, this winter i just decided i would replace the damn thing. but before i did, i decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible both bulbs i had tried were bad. 

so i'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as i'm turning the light on i realize:

the goddamn thing is dimmable. 


for 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

fuck me. 

tl;dr

for 6 years i lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",4
"by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.. today was the day i realised i messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

for the last 12 months i've been commenting on peoples posts, i've created my own posts. i haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as i can remember so i just figured i wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

last month i started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, i could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

anyway, i finally mailed the help team and found out my ip was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, i'm still in my own little truman show)

if you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

tl;dr i was muted one year ago and didn't notice. since then i've spent the whole time thinking how boring i must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

edit: so i've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! wilson and i thank you xx

edit 2: this is crazy! thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things i know nothing about. i'll figure it out and pay it forwards! special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - mvps!

please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that i've been such an idiot for so long. it's ok to laugh with/at me :)

edit 3: reddit is awesome. i've missed you guys! dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real pita. its just one of those things and i thank them for putting in the hours.

i also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. most of us here use reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

i love all of you weirdos <3

edit 4: no more i promise. i'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. i'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. i created an /ama when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/egcbe6w

stop giving me gold! i appreciate it but give to charity instead! heres something different we could do <3

"i have officially branded myself as the biggest perv... and i 100% deserve it.... this is his now ex-wife.

did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same reddit app? i logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

i've removed all of this personal story for my family's protection and changed this account's password. although it might be too late and already circulated online.

i took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

i'm only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags do not.

i came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. i saw his update saying i seemed alright, but i was keeping it in for the next morning.

reason we slept in the living-room is because i didn't want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before i finished packing. it wasn't ""fun camping"" or a ""picnic"".

this morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

i went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

i'm not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this reddit gold to the comments that i feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

oh, and if you can read this, i've deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

"by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my gf. minor background: i am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. i'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that i was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but i also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. i'm not gay, i just am me.

so while i was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. mine makes me look like a star wars character and his looks like the outlaw josey wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. the first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. whatever. so i get a call from my gf, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so i bid these mean girls and shawlbro adieu and head home.

i'm still wearing the shawl when my gf arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until i take it off. we get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if i'm gay. and she's really serious and aggressive about it. i tell her i'm not, that if i was i'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that i own a shawl. anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. so yesterday i invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to the big city, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually i just tell her very politely to get fucked because i'm pretty insulted by this point. on the way back, now that i'm not directly in front of her, i get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because i wore a shawl.

later on, i tell shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

we are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

tl;dr: me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

she's a nice girl, she's just not pickin up what i'm puttin down. it's a silly thing to be mad about.

"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw. so this happened a few days ago and i'm still not sure i'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

i've been with my girlfriend for about a year and i already know she is the love of my life. she's perfect for me. we're perfect for eachother. we're getting ready to move in with eachother and i want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

we went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

she went to the bathroom while i had her phone, and as i was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. if you have an iphone you know what i'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. it's annoying as hell.

but some photos caught my eye. some photos that i really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

there she is, the love of my life, trying to get her mouth around the biggest dick i've ever seen in my life. i've watched porn - a lot. i've never seen a dick like this. i'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. longer and thicker. as far as i could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

i could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

i closed the pictures and i've acted like nothing has happened, but i cannot get these images out of my mind. i've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats i'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

we haven't had sex since. i can't concentrate on my work. i just wish i had never seen those damn pictures.

tl;dr accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

/r/tifu last weekend. ,4
"by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.. recently, i traveled to denver, colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  as a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing i was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  what could possibly go wrong?

so the first thing i do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  and oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""are you looking for a mellow body high?  or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""yes, yes and yes!""  i reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  in hindsight, if i learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  sure, i can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite avogadro's number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

and it was at this dispensary that i also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and i were staying at).  as a result, before leaving, i begged my wife to buy some edibles that i could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  after expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

when we finally get back to the hotel room, i tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  what the fuck, denver?  seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that i should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" i read silently as i start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  but what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  so a second later, i covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

and then i quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  we may not have legal weed back home, but i routinely devour an entire package of milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

about 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  and that's when things start to go tits-up.  my stomach growls.  loudly and angrily.  my wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""diarrhea?""  but i merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""you didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""of course not."" i respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

a few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  i don't remember how i made it to my seat, and i don't remember even looking at the menu, but i do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if i was doing alright.

""keep it together, man,""  i say to myself.  but my wife's sudden groan suggests that i may have also said that to the waiter.  things are going downhill fast.

the waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

the moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  i start to worry that the jig is up.  

""you are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  not quite knowing what to do, i reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

at this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" i reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

my wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""bathroom. now."" she hisses. ""get it together.""  i reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  after splashing several handfuls of water on my face, i approach a urinal and start to pee.  

now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  as i am peeing, i start to get the very unsettling feeling that i have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

but deep down i know that is absurd:  i've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  i've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  so given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like i am about half way done -- that means that i've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

but the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  i try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

after finally finishing, i again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

next, i try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but i am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- i figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  to my wife's horror, i stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  but he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  he also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, i should probably eat one or two so that i'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

smart man. 

however, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, i start to get worried that i need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""do you think i should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" i suggest helpfully to my wife.

""what?! we literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

and at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""how many cookies did you eat?!"" she demands.

""whoa, easy there, torquemada,"" i respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""i had a few cookies, but keep it down.  i don't want your parents to know how fucked up i am right now.""

""really?!  they are sitting two feet away from you.  they know.""

i look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

tl;dr: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


edit:  wow!  thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  i think i have officially peaked in life.

as for part ii of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  at that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before i either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  so after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a secret service agent evacuating the president.  my night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  but being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",4

my dentist is a very nice and professional man. our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" my immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! you've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" i did not intend to make a sexual joke. his face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

i had my second dentist appointment today. i actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. he had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. his face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. i was a bit concerned and also confused. like how could i have embarrassed him this time? i had hardly spoken! so he keeps working in there and then i realize what the hell is happening. my dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. i had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

never going back.

"by having my reddit history revealed by jimmy kimmel live on tv. this happened to me yesterday and i'm still baffled.

it all started when i posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor william h. macy. i couldn't stop laughin over it but i never thought it would gain so much attention. 

however it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes i could have imagined. this alone was crazy for me because i never expected to have a submission on the front page.

when i checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links i received. i checked them and found my submission on the latest jimmy kimmel show with reddit co-founder alexis ohanian. i was mind blown over this.

they proceeded talking over reddit users and jimmy ended up checking my history. well i hardly ever post filthy stuff but i commented on a nsfw a few days ago and i think jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

i don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. on the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. however i regret nothing!

tl;dr: jimmy kimmel had reddit co-founder alexis ohanian as a guest. they ended up browsing my reddit history and jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

"by cumming into a coconut. edit: i got an ama thread now. help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


this didn't happen today but quite a few years back. for obvious reasons i'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

anyway, around 8 years back i lived in northern mozambique, a coastal southern african country with quite a warm climate. my mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. one of these was coconuts. she would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


anyway, being a horny teenager i fapped in regular intervals. unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and i was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. one day i hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. honestly to this day i can't fathom why i thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


i end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. i decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. i fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so i blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

for the next week the coconut is my saviour. whenever i want to get off i simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. it's heaven. now before i continue i'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


about a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (i had been using it pretty much every day since then) i begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. must be the coconut right? so i decide that i'll fuck it once more before i throw it out and get a new one.


**worst mistake i have ever made.**


you see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. as i penetrate the coconut one last time i begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. puzzled, i pull my cock out to discover that it is covered in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *teeming with tiny fucking maggots*. they were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


i screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck i was doing with my life. 


**never again. never again.**


tl;dr don't fuck coconuts.



edit: jesus this exploded. i'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because i sure cry everytime i think back to it.

edit 2: rip inbox

edit 3: thanks for the gold. it eases my shame a little. i'm thinking of doing an ama for you more curious individuals. maybe if the post hits 10k - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back

"by asking reddit which ethnic group to exterminate. today i had been looking forward to the qualifying for the formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing reddit whilst also watching some older formula 1 footage on youtube. so it got me wondering, ""some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they're just boring and far too controlled"". so i posed the question to /r/formula1 to ask their opinions also. shortly after posting, it transpired that the way i had asked the question could be perceived as...a little...'hitlerish'. check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. it somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. unfortunately for me, i am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that i must open every single one. it would actually play on my mind so badly that i wouldn't be able to sleep if i didn't open them, so i must open and read every goddamn comment. probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. i thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where i was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. but then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ usa woke up. and i've been playing catch-up ever since. took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. let's see what i go back to now...

link: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/

edit: thank you for the gildings you're all giving me, it's rather overwhelming.

the original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/formula1 somehow. 

as of 19:42pm gmt, i still have over 600 responses to read through. i will be reading them all, but i won't necessarily be responding to them all.

i'm really glad that i could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn't the original intention, but it's a great positive to take away from this experience!

edit 2: update - at around 20:20pm gmt, i opened up alienblue on my ipad to read these comments faster than on the official reddit app, and when i started from there i had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, i now have 976 unread messages -.-

edit 3: update - it's now 21:09pm gmt, i did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it's back up in the 4 digits. i am seriously sleep deprived right now, i have been awake since 16:00pm yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. finally they've subsided and i'm feeling really tired now, so i shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. i honestly didn't think this post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

edit 4: finally i'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. i didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, i also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages i have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. it's 6:00am gmt here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

edit 5: final edit, i'm now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17am. it's been great to see this happen, and i'm sorry to those who thought reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

tl;dr - made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks i'm a racist bastard.",4
"by telling my son's new doctor we are anti-vaxx. obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

my son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. we decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. i brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which i reply, ""oh, no he can't have that, i don't want him to get autism.""

i should maybe note here that i am an aspie too, and while i think my sarcasm is on point, i must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. the silence lasted an eternity while i imagine she was deciding how to proceed. eventually i laughed and tried to assure her i was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

as my son and i were discussing whether i was offensive (he thought i was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. he started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. he just kept saying, ""okay, well i have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

tl;dr: jokingly told my son's new doctor that i didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

edit: of course we took the gardasil. shout out to nurse pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. i wish everyone could have a nurse pete. also, since i'm editing, thanks for the awards!",4
"by performing the ""major tom"" technique and now i think i'm going to be disowned. if you aren't familiar with the ""major tom"", it's because it's a thing i (hopefully) came up with. it's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. this part is called ""getting in the shuttle.""

as you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. this is considered ""take off.""

if performed correctly, you should become very lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. this is called ""being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

this is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **i, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. you see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. no oxygen = no consciousness.

when i ""took off"" i fucking jumped up at mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. because the next thing i know i was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

before i could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if i was okay. she heard my re-entry. this part is called ""disappointing your mother.""

you can just imagine the scene she walked into.

she stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. i stared back with what i thought was confidence like i was buzz aldrin and just got back from the moon. but thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while i was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (at least not to my knowledge.)

she ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more judge judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. i cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and i managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

i'm currently writing this in my room right now, and i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until i can think of what to say to her. if there is anything to say at all.

**tl;dr: tried a new experimental masturbatory technique, ended up passing out, mom caught me with my pants down, and now i'm stuck in my room. planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do.**

**edit: only do this if you have a safe place to land if you fall. it is extremely easy to hit your head and die.**

"by agreeing to an ""open relationship"". obviously a throwaway. 

to put things into perspective, i (m 20) and my gf (f 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

we decide to spice things up a bit and ""open"" up our relationship a little. it was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole ""sex is fun"" idea.

she is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she's met a guy (m 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn't working at the time. i agreed. i tell her to go for it, and she does. she texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

the week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. wasn't expecting it but i'm cool with it. again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. a decision i would live to regret. she doesn't text me the entire night. weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

the next day i receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. a little more conversation and we're over. she's completely cut me out of her life. i check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. i've heard from her friends that they're dating now. 

tldr; agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",4
"by sending nudes to my employee group chat.. tldr at the bottom- 

well i recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). with that being said i'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. i also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

we have a groupme for the store i work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
the previous night i had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that i was with at the time. no biggie right? 
the next morning i had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. noon rolls around and i needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue i was having with a computer i was working on. 
i typed what i needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as i clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, i hit send without thinking and go on about my day. i should also probably say that by this time i was working alone and closing so no one else was around. the customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left i went to check my phone and saw i had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first i thought he was just calling me about the question i had, while the phone was ringing, i went back to look at the groupme, to my horror i clicked not just a picture from the night before, but the whole damn video. my heart dropped, instantly when i realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. i tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. lol on the bright side the coworker i had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


tldr: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out i send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

"by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.. my son was born with a condition called pectus excavatum. in layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. his condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. in december, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

about three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. the kid has been through a lot. 

well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. and because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""dad, i'm cleared now. a kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. can i kick his ass?"" well, my son isn't really a fighter. he's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. so i just figured he was just talking. but this is the first i had heard about the bullying and i was concerned. i could tell he was distressed about the situation so i told him to knock the fucker out. he just nodded and went to his room. 

now, his older brother is s tough sob. he had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. i talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. he told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. i asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. while i kinda agree with his thinking, i instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

the next morning i took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. on the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""have you taken xxxxx to school yet? well, after you do, go pick up your son. he got in a fight."" i just assumed it was my oldest son. imagine my surprise when i walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! he was beaming! he pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""i warned him."" i was so proud. 

he had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. my older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. he said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. he got suspended for three days. 

tl;dr i gave my son permission to beat up his bully because i didn't think he would and he did it.

edit one: the kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. it wasn't malicious. just two boys clowning around. he was horrified that he had hurt my son. the bully punched my son in the head every day. once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. my son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son could fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

edit two: my son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a lot of new friends. he used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. crazy!

"by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home. my friend jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and i finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  i ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

i made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  dude was intimidating and i'm a 4'11"" woman so i was immediately scared.  he looked shocked to see me.  i'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that i surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

i panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  i'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  i start screaming at him to get the fuck out and that i'm calling the police (total bluff because i didn't have my phone.)  he then yells back that he is calling the police on me.  this gives me pause.  at this point, i look around and realize the bedroom i'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  i ask him through the door if he knows jenna (last name).  he tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  well.  apparently, jenna's neighbor also keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

so, today i fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.

"by sleeping with a married woman.. so, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. nsfw or for anyone, really. and i may not be alive much longer, because i'm probably going to be murdered.

i'm at the bar the other night, watching the hall of fame game. after it's over, i go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before i uber home. this girl sitting next to me, very attractive. out of my league. like wayyy out. i'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. and she asks me 

""hey! can i trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""uhh what?""

 ""can you watch my stuff while i go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust greg, he's really nice"". annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. just random shit. showed pictures of our dogs to each other. talked about shows n stuff. typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. she asks if i've ever seen the show years and years. i say ""no, but i've seen the band perform live"". so she goes on about how great the show is, and how i need to watch it. asks if i have hbogo. ""yes because i forgot to cancel my cable after got"". so she makes me download the app, so i could start watching it when i get home. thanks for the recommendation! i'll probably check it out never. so a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. i have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""that's okay, i have pets too"" (or something like that. all i was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""i mean i guess, but i have to be at work early tomorrow""

""that's okay, i can only stay 30-40 minutes and then i'll have to go home""
""that's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time i'll need! am i right, fellas??

no. nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

it's about, 11pm at this point. i think? and mind you, i've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

so we tab out, get in her car. which is a stick shift. and i say ""oh no shit, i like you even more now! no one drives a stick anymore! i drive one every day!"" which i'm excited about, because at this point i'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows i like, and imma bout to get laid""

we talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). which is just a half mile away. so was a short drive. she parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

go inside, i try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. while i try to get my chromecast set up on my living room tv. ya know, to ""watch hbogo"".

she runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

it's fucking evan williams.

and this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

kids, i've slept with some strange in my time. i don't know how or why i get myself into these situations. i honestly feel that i'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. sure i troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but i do genuinely care about other people. being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. but in this case, i was dead wrong.

so after some talking about random shit. we get the show playing. i couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

sex.

so after, we're just laying there. pillow talk. was a good night. i just got laid. she asked if she could stay the night. we're gonna go to sleep. everything is cool. i let her know that i have to be at work in a few hours, so i need to get some rest.

now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* right?

wrong.

i say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""i don't think so""

""what why?""

""i don't think my husband would appreciate that""



i am speechless. i don't think i've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. like, how the fuck did i not see this coming. omg imma home wrecker. i'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

me: ""ummmmmmm what? is this an open relationship? does he know where you're at? like, why didn't you tell me that?""

her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""uh yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if i was him""


now i've been cheated on before. and that feeling sucks. i've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. where i didn't know that i was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. i had found out a couple days later, and i found him on fb and let him know. he thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. cheating is the worse thing ever.

so this is where shit starts to hit the fan. i don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

her: ""we're getting separated soon""

me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""yea but that's okay""

""how is that okay?""

""he's been..... abusive""


there's a slight pause, then she starts crying. so this is where the sober me starts to kick in. this girl is struggling. she's in a bad spot. and no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. and now i'm trying to empathize with this trashy evan williams drinking bitch. like i legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

que the panic attack.

she starts going nuts. ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. knocking shit over. basically trashing my house.

she asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. which i do. she takes it. and calms down. (for the most part).

now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. i tell her that we need to go to sleep. because i have to work in the morning. she tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" btw, evan williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

we finally get to sleep around 4? maybe? i wake up late, she wants round 3. and who doesn't like morning sex. i'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. so i gave her a fuck.

anyways, i need to leave for work. but her car is blocking mine. i tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. and told me i couldn't move it because ""i didn't know how to drive it"" 

""uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. i drive a stick every day, i can move your car""

i move her car. i leave for work. and i just let her stay at my house. i let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. two, i was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before i get home.

a couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. i get concerned, because i'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. i came to the conclusion that i should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... but, i see that she had already messaged him. from my facebook account! my computer was still logged into fb when i left, and i didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

i tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. he lets me go home. when i get home, i find her still naked in my bed. i get her friend to get her an uber. and i leave. oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

go back to work. thinking everything is over. that's the end of that. wrong again.

i get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. and only that shirt. like vag all out and everything. this girl is afraid to go home. which i'm worried about at this point. because i want her to go somewhere safe. she's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

oh yea, she had me find her phone. which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. and several others from other people.

she hands me $20 to order a pizza. and after we eat the pizza, she'd uber home. fuckin bet. i ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

i kid you not. i'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. and she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

this bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and i'm just ready for her to leave.

sex.

after, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. asking to go home. and i'm like 

""i'll get you an uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""no""

""what do you mean 'no'? you can't get in an uber with your pussy out""

""no""


so i gather up all of her belongings and clothes. and try to help her get dressed. to which she refused to allow me to do.

most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... that ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#i had the same feeling when i got her panties on.

pizza arrives. i go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. come back inside. panties are off again. god dammit.

we never even opened the pizza box. she's saying that she wants to go home. but is refusing to get dressed. i'm starting to panic myself. because i don't know how i got myself into this situation. but, am me.

she eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. and i read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""i'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where i'm at"" ""come get me"". and him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

that last one though. that's what i did.

before i called 911, i offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because i knew the husband would give her a ride back there. and not to my house. because now i'm starting to worry about my safety. i don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. but then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

i told them that i have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. etc. i tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

the ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. this girl is drunk crying. trying to get me to go for yet another round. where at this point, my dick hurts. also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

finally got her panties back on, i didn't tell her that i had called the cops. i told her that the uber was coming. and was trying to get her to put her pants on.

cops show up, i go outside. explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. but i kept my calm. i told them that i was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. but they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. she wanted to go home. officers ask if she was presentable. i pop my head back in the door. she's still wearing my shirt and her panties. so i'm like ""i guess?"", and then i let them in.

she yells ""are you fucking serious? you called the cops?"" 
""uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. even though you said you did. plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what i did""

the officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

que crying and what not.

cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. which i do. her husband calls her phone, so i accept the call, and then put it up to her face. tell her to tell him what's happening. and that she is getting an uber home. apparently her card and paypal was getting declined for the ride. so she couldn't do it herself. they live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. i live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a lyft/uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... girl finally decides to get dressed.

i had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... i could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. lol.

anyways, i hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. made sure she had all of her belongings. we get her to walk out of my house to the uber. but she tried to grab the bottle of evan williams. to where i audibly laughed. ""i don't think they'll let you take that""

cops didn't let her take it. she got in the uber and she was gone. policeman handed me the bottle back. where i say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

po-po leave, i call it a night, and it's over.

flash forward to today. i get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. i was at work at the time. so i wasn't able to check. but i'm 98% certain i handed those over to the cops. i look for them when i get home. found nothing.

oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

so that brings us to now. i haven't heard anything from her. or the husband. and i'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. but ya. know what? fuck it. i'm glad i could share this story with y'all. there might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

the moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

jk don't do that.

and don't stick your dick in crazy.

tldr: took a girl home who i didn't know was married. she trashed my house.

edit: i'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while i deal with mine.

edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2gia

edit 3: her car is still there. can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. i'm still alive. i see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. i'll get to them when i can.

edit 4: fml. i sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. no response. bartender texted me late last night and asked if i used a condom. which many of you have asked.... and no. i didn't. the girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. so i think i may have been baby baited.

edit 5: i'm still not dead. her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. i just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. so i walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... this woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. and she's most likely high on meth. because when i asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" she said ""no, noooo hehe"" i'm like ""yea, i'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

**update**

i've been texting a mutual friend of the couple. apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. i'm in the works of a tifupdate. but i'll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. i'd like to protect the privacy of those involved, but i'm just too lazy to do it right now.",4
"by thinking divorce was an april fools gag. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

my borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. they told the family they are getting divorced. i broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying i'm no april fool.

*edit*

wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*edit 2*

i don't think i'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. this blew up and i just got multiple texts from my wife telling me i fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... and i didn't change any names 

*edit 3.0*

ok it's been fun everyone, i may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. 

*edit 4.0*

uhh this post is getting deleted. it's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

*edit 5*

final edit. fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on reddit) how big of a dumbass i am.

thanks for everyone who said i'm not the asshole. i may have autism, but i'm not an asshole. 

*edit 6*

once again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up

give me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. i've got it, i've just got to convince my wife to release it. ",4
"update: i fucked up by not knowing the guy i like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass."". link to og post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

two months ago, i fucked up. i was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. i ended up realizing, not in a way that i wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab i work at. 

basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and i were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when i said, ""i would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" he overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. i was so fucking mortified. 

i didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. that didn't happen. on my first day back, i was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""oh fuck,"" i had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that i ought to apologize for my crass comment. but instead, i frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if i do that, he can't see me right? that didn't happen again. instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""hey my name, how was your break?"" 

i looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. he told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. he didn't bring up what happened either thank god. then he said something along the lines of, ""is that all your having for lunch?"" and i was like, ""uhm yeah, i was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

then he said, ""oh i was gonna go grab something to eat at a sandwich place near us, do you wanna come with?"" 

i was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. i tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so i said sure and we went. 

well. we ended up having a great lunch. inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""so tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think i spent staring at you?"" i literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""it has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? that has to mean i like you."" (btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

even with my shock, i managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

we have not done the butt stuff. he told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. looks like i will be retaining my butt virginity and i managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

tl;dr: despite my fuck up, it all worked out. we're celebrating one month together tomorrow! also, i'm a girl (got two comments asking if i was).

edit: yes, i accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" my b, my b. ",4
"by genuinely forgetting i had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in amsterdam and getting caught.. so this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

i would freely and happily admit if i tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

came with a couple of friends for the weekend to amsterdam for a birthday. it's a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

i'm sure most people know the dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit 'coffee shops' and buy and smoke joints. 

had a fun party night last night in town. went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

in a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, i put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...'did i ditch that joint'?

at this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

'sir, do you have anything in your pockets' says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

holy. fucking. shit. what to do? i'm still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. do i come clean? no way-too late for that. got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. but, schiphol airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. i'm asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. i'm sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did i smoke that joint??? airport guys hands pats pocket. i feel object being pressed into hip. fuck fuck fuck. 

'sir, empty your pocket please'? says airport guy. my partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. in slow motion i see the penny drop on his face. i dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. i feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

i'm dying inside. i say to pat down guy, 'oh god. i'm really sorry, i forgot that was in th...'
'haha, sure, sure - thats what they all say'! laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

i'm placed to one side. customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, 'don't worry sir! don't look so scared! you are 20th today and you won't be last! i'm sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately i can't let you leave amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home'. 

i almost wept with relief. i was made to sign a form to say he'd taken joint off me....and that was it...

i'm in a bar in schiphol airport in amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. to all you dutch-bless your hearts. you're the best. i'm sorry i was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

tldr i was a hot mess and genuinely forgot i had a joint in my pocket. got caught with it. dutch customs were amazing about it. 

edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

edit 2, thanks for the shiny stuff. first awards (on a story about my drug use).  i'm from uk for those asking.. my flights just landed and i made it through uk customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. i've just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. it says under what was taken, 'joints'. 

edit 3-schiphol doesn't frisk as matter of routine, yes i get it. thanks for correction.",4
"by getting reddit banned in russia. today reddit was blocked in russia, and i am the one who posted this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b4_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b1%d1%8b/) which lead to this.

in russia, there is a law which allow roskomnadzor, russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. two years ago i tested how rkn react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. on of that websites was reddit.

one thing i learned is that rkn doesn't want to block popular websites. they respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. it was on 05/21/2013(https://img.bi/#/vn0xdfz!sufwaazuq0ogfp6njqpmgqpwensqfa4kln1gdqhz). on 10st aug 2015 they posted a call to help them contact reddit administration(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official vk page. funny thing, but they called psilocybe a plant. several hours ago they reported that reddit is blocked in russia(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). seems like things changed.

how reddit is blocked? fully. as reddit switched to https, there is no way to block special page.

will i remove this post? no. i also think that reddit administration needs to do nothing. this is important issue on freedom of speech, and only rkn want to violate it.

btw, this post is a guide for indoor growing psilocybe mushrooms in russian. i'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to rkn.

"by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans.  about three weeks ago, i began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who i'll call ""ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

we live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. he's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. i thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt i get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. they are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

i ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. i used his email on the sign-up so that i could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

one small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. i sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which i mean i entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. i simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. i know how to do this because i'm a brilliant hacker (i googled it).

while carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: a shipping confirmation for an engagement ring. i immediately noped off his computer, and of course i didn't open the email, but the damage is done. secret's out!

my heart fell right through my butt, you guys. i actually died and now i'm a ghost writing this.

i probably should have pretended i never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but i was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. within the hour i broke down and called ray to sheepishly confess what i had done. he wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that i spoiled the surprise. 

here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

my punishment for snooping is that the suspense is killing me. i've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

a romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, i thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""why would you think that i'm going to propose to you?"" he said. ""that sounds like something you wouldn't know about because i'd keep it secret in my personal email!""

now he's started intermittently faking me out. the other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. he keeps getting down on one knee... looking up at me... and saying, ""gotta tie this shoe!"" the emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is maddening. every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

one more thing: i somehow fucked up the email settings. the shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. so that surprise got spoiled, too. turns out i'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

i guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and i do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

if we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

i come back from lunch, and bossman and two other members of my team come up to me as i'm sitting back down at my desk getting ready to get back to work. bossman is holding a piece of paper.

&#x200b;

""look. we need to have a chat about something. i've brought two of your friends in the team as support since this is obviously not something that's easy to talk about.""

i am confused.

""i have a blank hr report here. i'll need you to fill this out. you confided into me that you were sexually harassed in the workplace and it's my duty of care to make sure the 'poopitrator' is brought to justice. under the space where it says 'which hand did they assault you with', just put x8. we understand this is a traumatic experience for you and i just want you to know that every resource we have is here for you.""

"by trying to tell my parents about jeff epstein's suicide.. this literally just happened and i've decided to lock myself in my room until further notice.

i was surfing through my newsfeed this morning and i happened to see news articles that jeffrey epstein (rot in hell) has committed suicide. now, my family and i all talk about current events and politics. my parents were up and about getting ready for the day, so i figure i'll go tell them the news.

their door was cracked open, so there's the fuck up. i walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. as i hear my mom say ""do ya mind??"", i immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. all the while trying to burn away what i just saw.

they leave for the weekend at noon, and i have no plans on seeing them again this morning.

tl;dr: jeff epstein decided to scar me from beyond the grave.

edit: in one hour on a throwaway, i get more karma than my 4 year old account, first time getting silver, and front page for the first time? huh.

anyway, back on the ""fuck jeff epstein"" train.",4
"by making a girl i like laugh so hard she ended up in hospital and i almost lost my job.. so there's this girl i like at work, and we're really good friends. we're having lunch and we're making those ironic depression meme jokes as most friends do. for some reason i (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say ""well hey, you know what's just one letter away from sad? dab!"" and promptly did the deed. also i have ability to cry on demand so i just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.

she finds it funny. extremely funny. so funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. after a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. i asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, i start to reach for my phone.

and in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. i only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying i think she's having a seizure and i'm calling 911. fortunately, i was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.

turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. whoops.

tl;dr. made i joke with a girl that ended causing a asthma flare-up, manager walked in when it happened. she ended up in the hospital and i almost lost my job.

"by taking a picture of my wife's ass. this happened about a week ago.

&#x200b;

i  took my wife to barns & noble to get some new books for us to read.  i was half halfheartedly looking at different books while trailing my wife throughout the store. at some point i realize my wife is nowhere to be  seen, but whatever i'll find her eventually.

&#x200b;

after  a few minutes of mindless wandering, i notice her on the other side of  the store. i also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as i'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, i hear someone behind me shout ""hey creep! why are you  taking a picture of that girls ass!?"" i turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

i  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. my wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that i had to leave. she explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&#x200b;

the employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. honestly i'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. it was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&#x200b;

tl;dri took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. my wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  

and before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows i do this. yes, my wife is more than okay with it. she does the same thing to me.

&#x200b;

edit: just to clarify, my wife already had the picture in hand when she went up to confirm to the manager we were indeed married. the manager never doubted her affirmation that we were indeed married. i'm pretty sure she just wanted to show off her wedding dress again. 

edit2: i have asked the wife if i can share a picture and she has declined. sorry folks, enjoy this tiny ass(https://m.imgur.com/aqqoera?r) as compensation. ",4
"by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.. so, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. one of the classes i was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. while the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. for our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. i did my paper on helium-3 power generation. i worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. the papers were due last night at midnight and i held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. this is where i fucked up big time.

let me tell you a little about myself. i don't work a normal job. i tried it in my first year of school and i really didn't like it. i've worked internships when they came up but outside of that i really didn't ""work"". this and being a student really doesn't mix well though. so, i had to make money some way. for the past 3 years i've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. specifically, for furries. i would write anything. any fetish, any premise, anything. in some parts of that community i became really popular. at one point i was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts i charged  to my customers. am i proud of this? no. i have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. i told myself the minute i got a ""real"" job i was cutting and running from this work.

well, this brings us to last night. i had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. i had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. i was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. i was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. i ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. however, instead of submitting my final paper, i somehow submitted one of the commissions i was working on. this commission is not light either. it is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

so, i went to bed. submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. when i woke up this morning i checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

i want to fucking die right now. i don't know how i'm going to explain why instead of my final i submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. but yeah, i fucked up big time.

tl:dr: in my final semester at college. instead of submitting my final research paper, i submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. professor ""want's to talk"" and i want to die.

&#x200b;

obligatory update:

well, i just left his office and i still want to die. not as much though. i took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  i won't lie, when i sat down with him i was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. i guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

i ran down pretty much everything i said here. while he didn't agree with the avenue i was taking to make money he understood why i was doing it.

he had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""customer\_commission\_2nd draft.doc""). i've taken a class from him before and was an a student so he guessed i had submitted the wrong file on accident. he told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

i gave him the copy i brought and he accepted it. he told me to email him the file and he would replace the one i had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" he seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what i had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

like i said. i still want to fucking die right now. at least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . thanks i guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",4
"by finding a flashdrive and looking what was on it.. i found a flashdrive in my home and was curious as to what was on it. i put it in the computer and find folders full of family pictures and a video. it was blurred in the thumbnail, so of course i have to play it. 

it all happened so fast.

i see a dick. a hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.

and then it's cumming.  

and after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and i see my dad's shoes and the tile in our bathroom. 
i just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. this dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. 

he moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. i'm not going to give it back. i'm not going to assert dominance and return the favor. i'm going to burn it with fucking fire.

"by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.. well, fuck. 

not a throwaway because i have no shame left to feel. 

by orgasming so many times i went blind in one eye. that's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

seriously, though. last night i was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. i have bipolar disorder, i'm off my medication (that is a in itself), and i was in the early stages of a manic episode. for those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. i tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my mothman musical, and thinking about al gore. at about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, i decided i had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

enter stage left lesbian porn. here's the part where i mention how my clit is made of steel. i came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. for some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. having finished the porn (which i actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) i decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. now, whenever i'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, i always have to go completely under the covers. unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where i live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? anyway, for some reason i can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. maybe saudi arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? since this incident i've only slept for four hours. i'm losing my mind. 

anyway, at this point i'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. after ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. my clit breathes a sigh of relief and i emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. my right eye is stinging a little bit, and i realise the acne treatment i'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. i grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

i'm sure you can see where this is going, but i certainly didn't. and now i could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. i wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. the weird angle i'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. for some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. i felt genuinely betrayed. like, how dare you? you did this to me. this is your fault. et tu, clite? 

once my eye starts to swell up, i call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. arguably the weirdest walk of shame i've ever done. 

i continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. the swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. my eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

now i've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that i'll probably have to cancel. i've been wanting to bang this guy for weeks. also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and i can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish i'm shit out of luck. 

tl;dr: i masturbated and now i'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

edit: sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? this blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if i wrote it. damn my unforgettable mothman musical. anyway, i did not cancel my dick appointment. i told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (less endearing when i got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. i've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. hallelujah.

edit #2: clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. to clarify: i'm bi. also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, i guess.",4
"by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell. my wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. sometime over the weekend i noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. i asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the paw patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. it came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. i loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. so my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. i pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. my son looks happy so i figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

our conversation:

teacher: ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

me: yea! it's cool right? we've been playing with that thing for days. 

teacher: uh, mr. scott, do you know what that is?

i start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

i get confused. 

teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

i'm still confused...

teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

me: it just...stays in there? 

she nods. 

me: are you sure? i don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

we're both clearly uncomfortable. 

me: alright then.....so where do i get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


my wife laughed hysterically when we told her. my son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

tl:dr thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and i played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

edit: wow!!!! i cannot believe this got so much attention. i'm glad everyone got a good laugh. a bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn't know it was me, though. 

my wife has been reading the comments and insisted that i clarify that i know all about her cycle. we are ttc currently and, just as it was with our son, i know when she's ovulating, i track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. i grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices i was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. i was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like i said, this device helped save a chickoletta over the weekend. i've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. my wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

i'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",4
"by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think i was a heroin junkie. ever since i was a kid, i loved to fiddle around with staplers. playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. one of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. there are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes i'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. i've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200b;

this progressed from me messing around with staples in ms. grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. i had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? well...

&#x200b;

fast forward to present day. i am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. i have a home, a normal car, an office job. i am by all accounts a normal human being... **i still love staples.** working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. i'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. it got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200b;

so i had to stop doing that...i turned to amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. it wasn't enough. i went to 20, then 40. my wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". but i brushed it off as a work issue that i'd get reimbursed for and knew i had to change my methods.

&#x200b;

over the course of a few months i enabled myself...i started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. i would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. i began to stay out late and tell my wife i would be home soon, so i could go buy more staples from different stores. i opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. she got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200b;

this past thursday after one of my ""late nights"" i get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. i walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. because it is.

&#x200b;

my wife asked if there was anything i wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. i sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. this man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what i had in the bag from multiple stores. it basically looked like i was a drug runner for office depot who was using some of the product for myself. at this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. i had to come clean and all i could muster was

&#x200b;

""i...i like staples.""

&#x200b;

the wtf looks i got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when i showed them my car....i came clean. i backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. right now my only concern is my dad. he didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200b;

believe it or not, i think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. i may or may not do that, but the good news is i now can have a ""staple hour"" once i get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200b;

tldr: i have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought i was on drugs when it became a problem.

edit: 

thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! i am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. if you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, i just ask that you dm me/name the throwaway so i can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. i went to see a therapist today with my wife. i was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, i do need help. i am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. just tailored to my specific issue.

2. apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. that included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. so after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. my wife initially thought i was having an affair. she didn't think i was doing drugs until she got the pictures. the pi just told her what he saw, and she deduced that i had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. she admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. i do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. i am just an addict, and an idiot. i know how stupid the addiction is and so i tried to hide it. it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things i guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",4
"tifu by sending my wife a random dick pic. so this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that's less than three minutes from our house.  she called because our insurance card wasn't working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. i started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if i took a picture. to be funny i included my man parts in the photograph.  when she got home, i asked her how she liked the picture i had sent. she seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what i was talking about.  apparently she just handed the phone with the picture open to the pharmacist to grab the numbers off himself.

"by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99. throwaway account.

we've all been seeing the recent craze of dna testing and whatnot, so my dad and i decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. we got our results back a few days ago and i went into the dna relatives section to check out my matches. at the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% dna with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. this didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. my cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. we're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

i couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what i was seeing and i had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. the only realistic explanation for what i was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. all the dots lined up and i felt a sense of *loss*. i sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then i had a feeling of anger come over me. i needed some fucking answers. 

without even thinking, i rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. my mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. she had no idea my dad and i had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. my mother and i never had a 'traditional' relationship. she was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

my irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. i asked her if she cheated on dad with uncle david (name changed for obv reasons). i have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. she looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""what kind of question is this? of course not."" i told her everything; the test, percentages, dna matches, all of it!! shit hit the fan. my mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

i left her there and went back into my room. i called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. she ended the call screaming. dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. i told him everything too. he didn't say anything after calming down. he left the room and i locked the door. 

for the next few hours, i heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. my parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. my aunt in law and david showed up shortly later and i'm pretty sure i heard my dad and david get into some physical fight. utter chaos. 

i feel like fucking shit. ik it's not my fault but i can't help feeling that this is all because of me. if i had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. i'm too scared to go outside. i don't even know what the outcome was. the only noise i hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and i sure my dad is out of the house. fuck my life

tldr; mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. i take a dna test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. i've locked myself in my room and i'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

"by leaving thc chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles. my cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of thc chocolate for christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. my parents are 75-year old republicans. that was a big maybe.

&#x200b;

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

&#x200b;

you can guess what happened. my mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. her last words, high as a kite, were ""i think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200b;

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

&#x200b;

anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. so now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"by saying i was tired to my wife.. came home from the gym. its leg day. had full day at work too. work isn't bad. came home to happy kids. wife does a great job at keeping them alive. the best. had to take a shower before bed. wife says hurry because shes tired. i empathize by saying i will hurry because i am also tired. bad idea. wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. i do not dispute this since i am not a total moron. kids are exhausting but totally worth it. i tell her as much. she is most tired. i am only kind of tired. not good enough. she is more tired. i agree with this in order to ease the tension. unsuccessful. she is fully triggered by the fact that i had the audacity to say that i was tired. there is no escape. am screwed. 


tldr: am not allowed to be tired. ever.

edit: wow. that's a lot of comments and stuff. thanks, reddit. this weekend i will celebrate with a nap! cheers! what makes this cool is that i wrote it while pooping before bed. cant wait to tell my wife!

edit 2: my wife is the best. seriously the best. i'm not taking her back to the dealership. this was one of those events where you laugh about it 5 minutes later.  tonight we are going on a date so it's all good.


that a lot of you guys would not survive married life or kids. lol.

final edit: i am so thankful for my normal wife her normal, valid frustration with how i said what i said. either one of us could have easily ended up with one of you nut cases on here. lol. i can never  unsee some of this cringe and i cant wait to share all of these hilarious/insane opinions with her durning our date tonight. gotta go put on my clean underpants!",4
"by being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. nsfw. well, this didn't happen today. but it's a funny story that i couldn't share with reddit at the time.

rewind back to me at 14 years old. awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

as such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

one night, to avoid watching tv with my dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, i claimed that i had ""homework"" to do. of course, this was a lie. i just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

so i fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

now this is where things went wrong. i got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

you see, my bedroom was upstairs and i had no door. a sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my dad, his wife, and her two kids were watching tv. 

the desktop was right next to the staircase, but i figured that the tv was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. i was right.

but what i didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

i also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

i eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

and that's when i turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that i was casting a giant shadow puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. a perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. and i had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

so i did what anyone would do in that situation. i put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until i heard the tv come back on. then i went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

no one ever brought it up. and i'm thankful. but i know what they saw. and i'm still cringing.

tl;dr: got horny. got stupid. projected a masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. still embarrassed.

edit: well shit. glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

edit: holy fuck lmao. i'm proud and ashamed of how much yall liked this.",4
"by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend. i have grapheme-color synesthesia. basically i see letters and numbers in colors. the letter 'e' being green for example. a couple months ago i was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. he asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what i said a few months ago. always being the sameish as course. he still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe i just memeroized them really really well.

tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. i tried explaining to him i just see the colors automatically when i visualize the letters in my head. i asked him what colour are the letters in his head. he looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

my boyfriend didnt understand what i meant by visualizing the letters. he didn't believe me that i can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. when he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. he can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. he thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... its crazy to him the fact that i can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

now i have a boyfriend that is really upset. he feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. he's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing i wasnt pulling his chain. hes pretty upset and i feel really bad. 

tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (cant visualize anything at all)

edit; oh wow this blew up. i just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. he never thought i was lying. i think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",4
"by ruining a joke my wife has been saving for years.. tomorrow i'll be turning 32.  as we were waking up this morning she asked me if i was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. i responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but i was looking forward to it nonetheless.

she looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. i thought she was just trying to make sense of what i had said. instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that i ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. i didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget. 

it took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. unfortunately for her i've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.

tl ; dr

made a stupid joke to my wife about my 32nd birthday only being 30 seconds long and found out she's been saving this joke to use for the past three years. oops.

edit: i'm honestly surprised that i have to say this, but this was all in good fun. my wife is fucking awesome and probably one of the chillest, low-maintenance people i've ever known.  we have been laughing about this all day. the number of reddit relationship therapists showing up to tell me about my unhealthy relationship is staggering.",4
"by delivering for door dash. so i've been delivering for dash dash on the side for a few weeks now. today i had a typical order from a local sushi joint. i saw the order for a fellow named tom...funny thing the second half of the order is exactly to the tee what my gf always gets. two dragon rolls extra siracha on the side and a large ice tee. she is very particular! she also has a co-worker named tom she has mentioned and she said she spent the night up in denver with her sister last night for a girls night. hmmmmmm....picked up the order and was on my way. pulled up to a waaaaaay nice apartments knocked on the door and a very handsome fellow named tom answered. handed him the food and heard a familiar voice say ""make sure there's  siracha!"" it was my now ex gf in a t-shirt and panties. i said nothing she said nothing... door closed and well now i'm single! and onto me next dash better make that money if i'm going to be back on tinder. tldr delivered a door dash to my now ex gf while she was cheating on me with her coworker. tall handsome man with a nice ass apartment.",4
"by falling asleep in the back of my boyfriend's car. last summer. we're on a road trip from new mexico to mexico. we have a honda element converted for living in, so i crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. he stops at a gas station in the desert of arizona and while he's pumping, i get out to use the bathroom. come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. i jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. i sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. i reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

i go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. obviously they do, but whatever. so i start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think i'll steal it i guess. i go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. i realize i don't know my boyfriends number by heart so i just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. he doesn't. i use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when i call.

i resort to explaining to everyone whose phone i ask to use my situation. some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and i was just being modest. it's been about 2 hours now. the store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, i'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

a cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. i explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. she tells me i can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. i ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. we're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. i just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. and there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

he said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized i wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. and that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. he thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

edit: i understand ifu by not relaying my need to pee.
also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. also have never heard of this last man on earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. i have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened irl.

"by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life. this is long so tldr at the bottom.

this happened around 6 years ago when i was in 9th grade. i grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. my parents never taught me anything about genitals and i apparently never asked, all i knew was that's where the pee came out.

so one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. i was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. by that time i was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

so armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work i went home and a few google searches led me to discover that i had a severe case of phimosis. so being the pragmatic young buck that i am i also google how to fix it. there were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel i opted for the latter option. i got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

after about 4 hours of stretching i finally started making some progress! i could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell i've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. it dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. i kept stretching over the course of a few days and i started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as i stretched. some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as dick cheese. 

i cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. that was about to change real fucking fast.

so this was about 10 days into my stretching and i'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. i was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so i got very impatient and i decided i'd try to force it all the way back that day i lubed and got to work, i pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. i pulled it till i couldn't bear the pain anymore. i did this over and over again for around 3 hours until i somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. i got way too excited and despite the pain i gave it one big yank and i felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. it hurt like hell but i was just so relieved that i didn't care. i opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. the entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. that was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where i tore the top part of my foreskin when i yanked it over the glans. i freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. it eventually stopped and then i had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. i eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. i was still hurting but i was finally done. i got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. i thought that was it. i tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so i just left it.i completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. you know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? that's how my penis looked. i went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

when i got home i was still in major pain so i decided i'd check on it. i undressed in the shower and looked down at it. the first thing i saw were the blisters. two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. the next thing i noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. i'm a black guy.

i realized that if i didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. i lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. this was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. i kept trying to force it back over and i put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  my penis was on fire at this point and i was holding back tears but i kept pushing until i felt it pop back over the glans. judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain i felt i guess the second blister popped too. once again i left it and fucking went to bed. 

i checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. i rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks i was pretty much ok. my foreskin was still tight and i do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. even if they aren't as stupid as i was don't take that risk lol

tl;dr; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because i got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

edit: so i didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

so while i'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, i'd like to clear up something. this post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  rather, i'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

for those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. they have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. for those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. believe me it's not as awkward that you think. don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.

"by c*mming so hard i fainted. so this happened a couple of days ago..

had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. after changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, i went to visit a dermatologist. anyways, turns out i have a skin condition called pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. so she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. after showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and i sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. i noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back reaalllyyy good. so naturally i took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. naturaly i decided to take it to the next logical level: flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (yes i know this sounds mildy retarded). what ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. i busted a nut so hard i started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and i fucking fainted. my parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a reaaal worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. so yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. fml

tl;dr: found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided i wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. came so hard i went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

i'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

"by tipping my pizza delivery driver $1100. so today i sold my bitcoin i bought 2 years ago i spent like $100 on the investment or something, i cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing i did to celebrate was buy some edibles. i buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, i order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so i put 23.

since i'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks i grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. i give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. freaked out and high i say okay and just rush inside.

right now after waking up being passed out i realize what i've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

tl;dr - i tipped my pizza delivery driver $1100 while high on brownie edibles by accident and have no money to pay for my bills now

edit: thanks for all the nice comments and the reddit gold kind stranger. i just woke up and this post just blew up. i could never call the pizza place and ask for the money back, with how happy it made the women and the fact it was my own dumb mistake it just wouldn't feel right in my head, i would rather be late on my bills and figure anything else out then do that.

"i hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he's traveling with his wife and kids.. i know reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. this morning i was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. so i got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. so i said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. after 45min to an hour of fun, i thought i'd never see this dude again because i'm flying home this afternoon (right now).

wrong. i went to the gate when they started boarding. guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? you guessed it. to make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and i can hear all their conversations. i'm in the plane right now and he keeps texting. i am saving screen shots in case i need them in the future. i'm sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

this is so uncomfortable.

tl;dr: hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. turns out he's married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

edit: i gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. he texted me just now telling me he found me on ig and fb so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. now i definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

edit 2: a) i'm male. b) the wife does not know. he texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. and then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet i saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) c) i knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

just wanted to respond to popular questions.

"by not taking off my apple watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.. to begin, i'm a female bdsm practitioner. i enjoy it, and i won't apologize. (edit: that came out harsh. i'm sorry)

my husband often cuffs and whips me, and on wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. he put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my apple watch. i didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

so we get into it, and he's spanking me and i'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly i hear from my watch ""ma'am, i hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. we are sending someone to you. hold tight."" 

""did you call 911???"" my husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

so i tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name she said my name here? and i say yes... and she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

i said okay thank you, and i hung up.

""the police are coming.""

shit. i'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. we put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

i calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. i didn't mention the spanking.

apparently my husband did. another police officer comes in and asks about our bdsm contract. ""he told you about our contract?""

""he felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show state of mind.""

i go get our contract and showed it to the officers. after a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the apple watch if we're going to do that again.

tl;dr by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy bdsm session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

edit: iwatch doesn't exist. <3

edit: this post is not deja vu. yes. i posted it 2 days ago, and mods took it down, asking me to repost it today. the literally hundreds of people asking about if they saw this before need to read this edit. they took it down because this happened on wednesday, and according to the rules of the subreddit, sexual content is not allowed except for on weekend, so they asked me to repost it today.

edit: holy shit. thanks for the gold!! and the front page. i'm freaking out a little because contrary to the trolls, yes this happened.",4
"by texting my pregnant wife that ""this isn't working"". my wife posted earlier today on la about this. not using my main because my fil knows it and i'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

i went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. i had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when i turned it on. most of them were asking how i could do this. i had no clue what she was talking about. she didn't answer any of my calls back.

i got home and she was packing up to leave. i'll admit it, i cried. a lot. had no clue what was happening or what i did. finally, it comes out that i texted her that i wanted a divorce. she showed me the text and i immediately realize what happened.

this morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. i texted her ""the new mirror came in! i'm going to try to put it together but i may need your help later"". i had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. i texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point i think i need to just give up"". apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. so my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while i was off thinking everything was great. she even called a divorce lawyer.

things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. she told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

tl;dr accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

edit: wow, this blew up. to address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-i usually work from home unless i need to meet with clients. i don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. that's why she didn't know i was at work yesterday. i'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. if my phone goes off, i could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-my wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. that's why she had the reaction she did.

\-my comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. neither of us is mad at the other. this was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. we're fine. i posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. no need to psychoanalyze my wife or pm me about divorce. we are fine.

\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. we weren't really in a ""home improvement"" mood last night.",4
"by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door. throwaway account because obviously.

my boyfriend and i are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. we got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. we're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. i started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so i figured on going to completion. unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

so there i am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. his mom comes in! i freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

anyways, it's 5:40am, i've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

tl;dr: bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

update @7:31am - thanks for all the reassuring comments. my bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. more to come.

update @8:38am - of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... anyways thanks! so breakfast started off totally fine. i mean, yeah i was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. that is, until i excused myself to go shower. she stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. but then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". it was sweet and cringy all at once. i guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

update: a lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. actually i assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); i didn't actually see her do it. i asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while i was...ehm...cleaning.",4
"by realizing that my ceiling fan has been making my bedroom a sauna for 11 years. i've been living in this house for the past 11 years. in my bedroom there's a ceiling fan that i always have on to try and make my room colder. my room has always been insanely hot compared to the rest of the house and i never understood why.

flash forward to today when i'm talking to a friend that said they found out their fan can switch directions to heat the room in the winter. i immediately realized my fuck up. when i got home i took a closer look at the fan and hiding by the light is a little black switch. i hit the switch and what do you know, my room is about 10 degrees colder in minutes. i've been sleeping in a sauna for the past 11 years and had no idea. every day in the summer waking up sweaty was because of a tiny black switch.

tldr: my ceiling fan has been spinning the wrong direction and heating my room for 11 sweaty years",4
"by taking lsd and pretending to be french for 10 months. throwaway for reasons.
tl;dr at the bottom.

so this was more of a fu that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

about 11 months ago i moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until i could get the money together to sort something out properly, i was hoping to have already moved out by this point. on my second day after i'd finished unpacking i decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, i'd brought some with me that i'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and i quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than i had been told they were, and i thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. so i figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because i was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

so i left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. it's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. i'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. she said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

so basically i do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where i pretend i can't speak english. i remember a few words from my gcse french so i just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. in the state i was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and french just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. my exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and i shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. she pretty much just left me to it after that and i got on my way. i did my walk and got home about two hours later, i was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. when i got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. i tried to keep my head down because i couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so i instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. when i got in i started freaking out straight away because i realised that i'd just become french and now two of the neighbours think i can't speak any english. the next day when i woke up i realised the best thing i could do (as an englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be french for seemingly no reason. 

fast forward 10 months, i still live here, and at this point i'm in deep. my life on this street is a web of lies. i've perfected my french accent and over the course of 10 months french me has learnt a decent amount of english so he can hold disjointed conversation.
i'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and i was the nice quirky french guy on the street. i didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation i had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered i wasn't french. if i had friends come over (i don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. most of them found it amusing, at least. 

things were going okay and i wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because i'd gotten so used to it. i'm not home that much and when i am i rarely leave the house for any reason so i only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when i was out on my street. if anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when i got to take on my french persona. french me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his english was a bit limited.

but then there was the day it all came crashing down. i was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her i didn't recognise. she stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy i was telling you about"". you might be able to see where this is going. 

her friend hits me with a question in french that i didn't understand a word of, and i knew he was actually french straight away because his accent was way better than mine. i didn't know what to do and i just froze. every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause i just decided i had to come clean. i told her i wasn't actually french and couldn't speak french and then i tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke i'd been doing on everyone. nobody was buying that. i fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

i haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which i'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. i make sure nobody is around now whenever i leave the house, and i do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when i get home so that i never come into contact with them. every time i think about the day i was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

tl;dr: pretended to be french to avoid human interaction on lsd, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a french man.

edit: i didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and i'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. some people seem to have a hard time believing that i thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, i'd like to remind people that when i made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",4
"by making my boyfriend a tinder account. okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

obviously i think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though i've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. so, for some stupid reason, i decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. i set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

after a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after i showed this to him, i saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

queue my surprise when a couple of days later i check the tinder account i had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and i could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

i confronted him and he denied it but i mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity i checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. so now the tinder i made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

tl;dr: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

edit: wow i did not expect this to blow up! thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. it honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be. 

also, if anyone needs help with their tinder, hmu lol because i'm apparently pretty good at it.

"by matching with my homophobic uncle on grindr. so i have an uncle (we will call him j) who has always been very vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. there is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

well this weekend in between family gatherings i was looking to meet somebody . i started chatting with an older man because that's how i roll. a lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so i don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. we actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics i wish i could unsee and sending a few i wish i could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

so i'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . it is at this moment i realize my fu, i've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  he tried to play it off like a random encounter but i wasn't letting him get away with that. after some pressing he finally admits that he is the man i've been talking to and i told him i don't judge him like he does me . he apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

he kept talking with me like he was still interested and i had to make it clear that was not going to happen . i had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him i had to go ahead and block his number. i can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

always get a face pic, people.

tl:dr: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . should have insisted on the face pic

edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but i'll answer some pressing questions . i did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who i was . it is pretty disturbing to say the least. as far as blackmail goes i have everything saved but i don't plan on doing anything with it as i think that could actually put me in danger . this man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

edit 2: this was fake . reddit is gullible and i fucking hate . it's all fake stories just like twoxchromosomes . get baited . ama https://www.reddit.com/r/ama/comments/bgvj1e/i_made_the_front_page_with_50k_upvotes_yesterday/",4
"by telling a stranger i can't wait to fuck them tonight. disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. i only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, ""what was your most embarrassing moment?""

so i was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing i would get fully sloshed at the party. she was right.

on the way home, i ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. she pulls her light blue jeep into the parking lot, i stumble out of the jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

i (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. ""i can't wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.""

i was not expecting to get hit in the face. i also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming i've ever heard in my life. instinctively, i covered up my face and wondered what the hell i said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

the screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so i couldn't really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when i heard, clear as a bell, ""you fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.""

whoa whoa whoa instant sobriety. i uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although i was in a blue jeep, it was not my gfs blue jeep. my gfs identical blue jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman's blue jeep. 

i finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. she convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

i did not fuck anyone that night. 

tl;dr: drunkenly got into the wrong car, assumed the driver was my gf, and told her i was going to fuck her",4
"by sending a video without watching it and now i am being adopted.  so last thursday night i saw everyone tagging their step dads in the budweiser commercial. without watching it, i sent it to my stepdad. about an hour later my step dad and mom call me and ask if i'm hinting at something. my step dad is like i know you had intent. i'm like huh??? omg in the commercial the adult children are asking their stepdads to adopt them. so he starts crying, thinking i want this. now i can't tell him that i didn't mean to. friday he squeezed me so tight and said he wants me take his name and make it official. etc etc. all i can think is wow that sounds like a huge hassle. but i can never say anything about it being an accident. so like now i'm being adopted and changing my name.

"by making my wife think i killed myself. right off the bat i want to say that i am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. this was not a prank gone wrong, or something i did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. burner for reasons.

&#x200b;

this happened a couple of weeks ago. i tripped and sprained my ankle. it's been bothering me enough that i've been taking epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. in addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, i also find it incredibly relaxing. say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, i enjoy a good soak.

&#x200b;

i also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. it's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...i call them old man spots. they're harmless, and most of the time i don't even notice, but every once in a while...i'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. additionally it takes foreverrr to get the bleeding to stop...its not like i can elevate my balls, let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200b;

well...on the day in question, i get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. so, i get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. it's not really important how i did it, but i ended up nicking one of those spots. so, after cursing a reasonable amount, i start the lengthy ritual of holding tp against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. even after the bleeding stops i have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...well i finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. i put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200b;

 i wasn't asleep but i was really zoned out and relaxed...until i was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. i've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. it scared the shit out of me, and i jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. i shouted ""honey? what the fuck!""  she didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  it took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""jesus christ!"".....i could see what it must look like to her... i had apparently not stopped the bleeding as well as i thought i had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200b;

it took me a long time to calm her down, and i don't think that's something you just get over. hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though i thought i had. took a bath, zoned out. wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact i was bleeding into the water and thought that i had killed myself. sorry honey.

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage. bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

edit: for anybody interested, the mac n cheese is a very tasty recipe for those on a fodmap diet. you can replace pretty much all elements for low fodmap alternatives - gluten free pasta, lactofree milk and cheese, asafoetida for onion and garlic oil for garlic!",4
"a marriage.  obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

 so i sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. i live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... so common that i sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 one particular day i dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that i had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. so as we arrive i mention this to the rider:

me - hey i just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

rider- no, must be the wrong house

me- nope, he walked right out of that side door. i dropped him off at *names local bar* his girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (i had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) you guys having a family/friend vacation?

rider- this is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. nobody lives here but me and my wife and i've been in ny for work for the past 4 days. 

awkward silence as we both come to the realization. 

he got out and i drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth. 

tldr- i may have ruined a marriage by trying to make small talk with my big mouth

* edit- thanks for all of the support guys! i know i did nothing wrong, i just hate being involved in other people's businesses, especially when it's so negative. 

 also - thanks for the silver and platinum awards!",4
"by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.. dear lord. on my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so i clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  i click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

this is my sons account. it has to be. the comment he posted is about something that happened while i was there. he had a more detailed post about that specific day. he had another previous post about an event in his life i knew about and knew some details about. he had a few other posts which i also read. 

i now know what gets him going sexually. not something i needed to know.

i know what his girlfriend likes sexually. also, not something i needed to know. also quite surprising. 

i know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. i feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

i know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife's room.

in reading through the comments he's made to others, i've learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. i feel very proud about that.

overall, i wish i never clicked that first comment. i know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

tl;dr. accidentally discovered my son on reddit. found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, i shouldn't have read all of it. and some posts i stayed away from. and honestly, i didn't realize it right-right away. the first post i read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. it was after another that i really put the pieces together. and yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. but hey, life isn't always fair. i also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything i read.**",4
"by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards. this actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. in 2016 i started using tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. i had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. my profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

fast forward to march of 2017 and i matched with someone. after a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. a couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. this all sounds great. except for two problems.

the first problem is that i have a beard in all of my photos. and even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. my facial hair is like if someone shaved a guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. if i grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. wiry and sparse. it's not good. for six years, i'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. but for some reason, the week before we started talking, i had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. i just wanted to know what it looked like. the answer? not. fucking. good. at this point, i was 27 but still looked young for my age. shave the beard off and i look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. really fucking awkward.

so i pulled up to her house and text before i got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as i expected. all good so far.

i went inside and we end up hanging out all night. she cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. she was blown away by the fact that i'd never seen labyrinth and demanded we watch it. we ended up watching three movies that night. for labyrinth, i was about five feet away on the couch. for young frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. for the third movie (which i can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. and this is where the second problem comes in. 

after my breakup in 2016 and realizing i'd been battling lifelong depression, i started taking antidepressants. one of the super fun side effects of ssris is that it can be really hard to climax. like, try as you might, nothin. dust. moths. nothin. thanks, big pharma.

and so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck i might have a heart attack. why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""what about this position?"" ""ouch!"" ""oh my god, i need a towel. so. much. sweat. i can't see."" we were in the basement on a large three piece couch. you know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. well at one point i tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. a bruised ass. a bent dick. a lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

if this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. and jesus christ the sweat. so fucking slippery and gross. this wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. this is bog monsters come to life sweat. this is ace ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. at one point our chests become suction cupped together. i could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. and the chafing. fuck. no matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. we both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. my poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. this was no climactic movie sex scene. this was a john waters film come to life. 

well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. it's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. we went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. i'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. we sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (she had just moved back home before finding a new place). so not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now i get to meet her mom for the first time! great! i'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. life is fucking weird.

well, the reason i am posting this on march 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on march 14th of 2020. our sex life is far better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. i mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

tl;dr i met up with a tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




edit: just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! i am still wholly undecided if i will ever show her this post. it's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. we'll see though. and thank you so much for the gold and silver! did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. and for those asking, i've changed my dosage on my ssri and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! and also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. he didn't pan out. within three months, her mom got hit up by several tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

edit2: i guess now i probably have to show this to my fiancee to which she will reply, ""i have no idea what any of that means. good for you, i guess?"" i still love her.

edit3: a few of y'all keep asking, ""why in tifu?"" well, let me tell ya, if i had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. even worse than my breakup the year before. not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? yeah, that sucked. just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't suck asssss on the whole. i mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. thanks for coming to my tedtalk

final edit: for real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. i told her about this post when i got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when i read it to her. we spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift drive-thru theater setup",4
"by accidentally asking my wife's sister for a three way.. this fuck up mainly involves three people me m32, my wife f27 and her sister f25.

so for context a normal saturday is for my wife and i to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

this week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

so off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our saturdays.

as we are about to leave her sister says ""have fun"" in a cheeky way which i completely don't pick up on.

my brain decides that as my wife and i spent thursday together for valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

so straight after the ""have fun"" and without consulting my wife, i say ""you can tag along if you like""

the atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and i'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so i double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""as you said it will be fun"".

my wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when i've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

i've apologised and explained. i know we will laugh about it later but for now i'm playing lego lotr on my own. 

tl:dr i asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do.

edit: well this post went nuclear! oh and thanks for the golds kind strangers. 

a couple of things i'd like to address, many of you seem to think its bad we don't spend saturday with our kids. well i work from home 4 days a week and my wife is a stay at home mom. our kids are not yet school age so it's nice for us to have time as a couple on a saturday.

yes, i spelt invite as invight, oh well.

as for an update, lego lotr is now being played two player!

my oldest son is in the marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  he took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  at first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. when it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  i tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



i get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  he gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his dress blues.  now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



we discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  we go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  we settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... free internet points and all that......



i walk in and the house is quiet.  no one in the living room.  a little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



what i did not know was the entire time i was gone, my wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  she got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



so no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to surprise her.  a handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  the text told my son to stay outside.  i had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



so my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  i told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  the look of confusion on her face was priceless.  it took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, there was our son in his dress uniform and she was estatic.  the noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  it goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess will have to suffice instead.




tl;dr  didn't tell wife that marine son was coming home, missed out on sexy times and the second half of the packers/falcons game



edit 1: goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

update: wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  she is worried that this story will end up in one of her marine moms fb groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.

"by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.. i'm in my third year of university taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. to start the semester i ended up missing the first week of school because i was on a last minute trip with my friends. it was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since i technically couldn't afford to go.

anyway, i came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. on both those days i have classes all day until 2pm so i usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. so my first tuesday home i ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. when i get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*explains above about material*
prof: ""what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad?""
me: ""no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad?""
prof: ""pardon? i don't have a textbook for this course.""
me: ""it literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*shows syllabus*
prof: ""wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
me: ""what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right?""
*prof starts laughing*
prof: ""haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i've never experienced this before.""
me: ""well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn't make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing ""this is a new one for me."" turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow!

tldr; i was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until i finally realized. then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. crazy coicidences all around.

edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto's birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.

2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). so i do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. i highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. it's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i'm sure it will turn out fine. it'll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.

thanks for all the support too. :) making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn't crush it but there is no way i didn't pass. it was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. the prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""i usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm i will take the average to make up that first exam."" so all in all i survived and live to fight another day.

just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. i will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. in the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. but somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - cz

"during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student. 
i'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. in this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. if you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. as this was my first laparoscopic surgery, i soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. like many of you, i had no idea this role even existed, but i quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. i approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. i placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. after several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  the attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? get that stopper out of her ass!""

thank you for reading. i'll go die now. 

tl;dr  couldn't see under the sterile drapes when placing a rubber stopper in the vagina during surgery and accidentally placed it in the rectum",4
"by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop nsfw. so today i had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, i'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story i'm 27 and i live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time i've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and i for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. we've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

so on top of making porn i'm also an aspiring film editor and i am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but i also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us i'd been editing a new video, usually after editing i go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because i'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. we were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, i immediately said sure and led him into the office, now i could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and i kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. so i lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as i opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst i ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

i panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and i are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but i hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and i'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



tl;dr i unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

update: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so i'll explain, as i said earlier in the post i watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep i just shut the laptop without even thinking, i do this often (i know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. still haven't heard from her dad yet. i honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and i laugh a lot so thank you

update 2: thank you all for participating in a social experiment stay tuned",4
"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

thanks for coming to my ted talk.",4
"by trying to play my dad's didgeridoo.. so my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in australia 10+ years ago. my parents wanted to go out for a walk but i decided i'd eaten too much cheese and couldn't be arsed. while they were out the internet went down so i was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when i spotted the didg. i thought to myself in all these years i've never actually tried to play it (it's more of a decoration and i barely take it in when i see it) and maybe it's time. i pick it up and put it to my lips. i felt like i knew what i was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. i take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. i splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. at first i thought it was saliva and ignored it as i had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. it felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. i glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. the second i clock what's happened i feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. i have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. i run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. i urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. i don't think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

tl;dr - thought i could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.

edit; woah gold! and front page! ta! glad you all like/hate my story",4
"by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic. throwaway because i'm still embarrassed and i don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

for background, i usually make the bed in the mornings, but i didn't yesterday morning because i was running late.

i went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. i got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. i checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and i just couldn't find her. her wallet was there so i figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. i started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. i called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. i called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. my father in law told me to track her phone, so i went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. i turn on the find my iphone sound and start running through the apartment thinking i should call the cops.

i hear the sound coming from our bedroom so i go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell i'm doing. turns out the small lump that i thought was just a pile of blankets since i didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. she sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

i had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

tl;dr i didn't make the bed yesterday morning and then i thought i was about to end up in an episode of svu.",4
"by going down a reddit rabbit hole.. this didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and i bought a new car. i was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

i came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse reddit while i'm taking care of my business. most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. i can't remember what sub i was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. before i knew it i was reading about ""the donkey show."" yes that one. some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. i wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so i just kept reading.

someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how the donkey show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. midget porn. i thought, ""what the hell, i've never seen this sort of thing before."" so i clicked.

as weird as it sounds, i clicked out of curiosity......i swear. what i saw was exactly what i expected to see. this specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. after a minute or so, i had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub i was in.

i finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. i get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

she was taking a while, so i grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. my wife comes out and gets in the car. immediately she says, ""what the hell is this?"" i put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. on the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". i had never had a car with this feature before, so i was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. i knew i was screwed. it felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so i could change what was displayed on the screen.

after about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks i have a thing for little people. before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. all i could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. i'm pretty sure i'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. yay me...

she said to me one day, ""i know you won't leave me for another woman, but i'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

i doubt she will ever let this one go...

tl;dr i went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

edit: damn! i fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, you guys are awesome! i'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.

edit2: just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while i was pleading my case, we kept it very g rated.

"by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.. yesterday i got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. i squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. i notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where i'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. he looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. as a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

though i couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so i decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. as i sat down i thanked him for making room and told him i really appreciated the gesture. we high-fived and in hindsight i should have ended it there.

i noticed he had his backpack with him so i asked how school was that day. he told me it was just alright. then i asked the fatal question, ""do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" he let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. she yelled ""oooo boy!! you told me you finished that yesterday! guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! you, ya little liar!!!"" his head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

a few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. he looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, i thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" his look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

hang in there little buddy! one weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies!

tl;dr- sat down next to a little dude on the subway because he went out of his way to make room for me. asked him about homework and now he cant play his video games for the whole weekend.",4
"by getting google to ban our entire company while on the toilet. **tldr; company uses google accounts that are all connected. i fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the google account, and all associated accounts. everyone in my company is now blocked by google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

preface, this happened on friday and is still on-going. i've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so i won't be outed since i guarantee someone will read this eventually. i still do not know if i am the culprit, but i am 90% sure that i am. i feel like this is a fireable offence and i will step up and take it if it comes to that. i'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

i work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. we migrated to gmail and other google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. it's safe to say that everyone is using gmail or google in one way or another. now, our gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

i have a friend who creates android apps on the side. i do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called titanium backup. 

as a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), i buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. after that, i send him an e-mail with the cloned version through gmail with something along the lines of: ""look at this cool app i found on the store, it was completely free! try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. it was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

recently he uploaded a new app and i did the same thing as usual. i was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. i was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. i e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

about an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their google accounts. at the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

one of my colleagues requested help and i went to check it out. it turns out that their account was blocked by google due to tos violations. their google payments account was blocked as well. i thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. we got banned by google, all of us. 

the afternoon was pandemonium. we were all freaking out, our it guys were trying to get a hold of google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. we could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. all our work was shared with google services.

eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. it wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. one of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

anyways, we were all told to go home on friday. i went home and looked this up myself, and i found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the google payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. it bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how i said all our work accounts were connected?

yeah...

so it's been two days now and we've been chatting over skype, no one knows what happened and the it guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that google isn't helping us out. their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. the posts i've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

so yeah, that's that. i'm 99% sure that i am the culprit who caused this. i do not know why google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but i fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. i might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**edit1:** this blew up pretty quickly. luckily, i have 3 pms from people close to, or reps who can help me out. if i missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. i am in touch with one of them now and i am getting in touch with it at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. i will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out.

"by seeing my mother's porn.. my pc sits next to my stepdad's laptop in the living room. my cat likes to jump on the keyboard or the laptop and lay on it. a moment ago, he jumped up onto the keys and the screen lit up showing me to opened photo gallery. i went over and was going to close the application and then shut down the laptop. i was greeted with three distinct photos.

&#x200b;

one- my mother and my stepdad in a threesome. the thing is, the person in the middle was my mother's best friend. i saw her eating out my own mother as my stepdad drilled the other girl.

&#x200b;

two- my mother sucking off my stepdad, in my dad's house. on the counter. where i eat.

&#x200b;

three- more tame, but my stepdad (who is bald) with a decent head of hair. i've never seen him with more than a little fuzz before.

&#x200b;

so i have to face them tomorrow with these images seared into my mind.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - saw my mom's porn. help me god.

edit: my mother woke me up while i was operating on three hours of sleep and ho boy. my stepdad uses reddit. he found this. you fuckers brought me to the front page. this is my first time ever here and my lord, why this post? thanks anyway, even though my life just got a lot worse, now i have 10k virtual clicks!

edit 2: not 30 seconds after posting this edit my mom said she looked at the computer and couldn't find these images, and then i got my first ever medal in this gold. fuck the internet man :)",4
"by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter. this just happened last week. i got home from working out of town thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. ""beth"" comes in and i can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. she feels fine though. 

i am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. i wake beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. it is more than half closed and a little red. she still feels fine. as soon as the doctor opens, i call them and they tell us to come in.  

we get there and i go to check in. the receptionist that i have never seen looks at my daughter and says ""oh. my goodness, what happened?""  so i respond as a joke ""eh, she got out of line"".   

i know!  it's horrible. i'm sorry!  i have a weird sense of humor and i'm a bit socially awkward.  anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  soon we are called in. the checkup goes as expected. it's a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter zyrtec or benadryl.  then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

he comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. the doctor is angry. we all head to the doctor's office to talk.  

there is a policeman and a policewoman. the policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. my daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  so she says no and buries her face in my side.  the police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. i saw one of beth's cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. the doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

the police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. the doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. he just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  i now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  she makes an excuse and leaves the room. he says that he thinks he has to let her go. he says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. he says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

the police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if i can come to the station.  a friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

we get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   the police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. they say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  i call my wife who goes ballistic.  

the county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if i sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. my uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. i stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that i really don't need to make for this week.  i can't wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but i'm pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  

edit: spelling

edit 2:  update
thank you for the gold kind strangers.
wow this blew up.  i wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  i want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  for those of you saying that i am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) i will not be sleeping on the couch.  my wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  at least not at me.

2) i am heading home from boston tomorrow evening and i think everything should be resolved by then.

3) i will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  she was very young did not do this out of animosity. i do not know what if anything will happen to her job. i am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) the other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  a few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  these lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  the receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   the dep closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  it turned out to be nothing.",4
"by teaching my baby sign language. i go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (aka she doesn't think i am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. but all these kids know sign language, and i thought that was pretty damn cool. so i start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! she can call me mom and my husband, dad! holy shit! thanks pinterest moms! i take back all the shit i talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

well today with my husband out of town, i didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants i decided to go out for a quick dinner. the kid loves french fries and so do i. so we hit the local burger joint and i order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. the server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and i set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. so of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". and every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. ok, whatever. 

well i notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. i'm like okay, i did like 4 quick google searches, maybe i botched some of what i taught her. it's fine. but then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iphone down with a message typed out for me to read. it says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

i'm like... wait... what? so she continues to show me that i have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since i am her mom. i can only imagine what the pinterest moms would've done had i shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

tl;dr asl is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

eta: thanks, everyone! i'm glad you all enjoyed this post. please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that i was trying to teach my child proper asl. they were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as asl. they just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

also please note that i literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. i have no idea how close they were to the real signs. additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. she speaks english well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. we were always sure to say the words while signing them. she now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that i decided to share with you all. i'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". you can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",4
"by letting my boyfriend have control over the lube.. we are in the middle of the polar vortex. i got a phone call last night saying that i didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

we decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. i was ready to get laid, because, well, i wanted to. so i told my boyfriend to grab the lube while i climbed on top of him.

the bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it like this(https://i.imgur.com/llijq5v.jpg). i was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. he squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

while he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. he couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as i screamed and jumped off him.  the bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

i now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. we sobered up real quick, i fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

&#x200b;

tl;dr boyfriend got too close using the lube, clit got vacuumed into the 7th gate of hell.",4
"because i finally learned how to wipe my butt. i asked my girlfriend the other day, ""why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?""

she told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

i followed up by saying, ""but sometimes, people can see my butt.""

she started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

so i had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; i wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

i then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/(http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and i was shocked.

we were both curious where/how i even learned that from.

was it a potty training error? apparently not. we asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

so, i've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

\#dead

tl;dr

for 20 years, i squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt.",4
"as a reaction to butt worms (almost certainly nsfw). this is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

for background: at some point in my childhood, i developed pin-worms. in the interest of science, i must admit that i don't know for certain that i had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that i had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

i'm afraid that i don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all i remember is that as a young child i walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and i don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

fast forward a decade and a half: i am living on my own. single. re-acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone i am still close to refers to as ""she-who-must-not-be-named"". i don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....i had worms. my butt was beyond-normally itchy. sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. the confirmation came when i showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

i hoped they would go away. i showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. but every morning, i would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

i was horrified, but i made an appointment at my local clinic. when i told the nurse over the phone that i thought i had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. she said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

i went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly south-east indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

i was already frustrated, but i waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. later i drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before i would get results.

in the meantime, i remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

i would like to say that as a liberal american male, i wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that i did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, i dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what i had done.

now to add: i had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. we had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; i wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and i found ourselves showering. my hand drifted down to my butt-crack and i realized i \*needed\* to share my story with her, despite fears that i would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. so i spurted it out: ""uhm, so yeah, i...uh...think i have butt worms....""

she was so practical about it. she asked to see. i pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""see,"" i said, embarrassed. ""worms.""

...

""that's toilet paper"", she replied.

""w...what?""

""yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""that's toilet paper.""

everything fell into place. about a month ago, when finances got tight, i swapped my normal tp roll with dollar store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after i wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

my relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . my shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

tldr: i spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because i bought cheap toilet paper.

postscript: shower companion and i just celebrated our 8th year wedding anniversary.",4
"tifu- by not knowing about sunblock expiration dates. i applied spf 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. i was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

i pretty much had no idea that i had a problem until i scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. i considered for a split second that i had a burn but like an idiot, i rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

the blisters formed by the next day and i started reading the can to see if i missed something about applying it. i found the customer service number and called it. before talking to anyone, i heard a recording tell me that the fda doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. this bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

i had no clue. 

i went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

it was easily one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. i soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


this was preventable- sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions. 

nsfl
 https://imgur.com/3nge8nm.jpg 


edit- i want to clear up: i'm naturally, very pale person, i was at high altitude while on and in the water. i do not blame anyone but myself for this. whether expired or i stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. i should have been careful with making sure the things i use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
i agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, i just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
this isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

i'm not planning to sue anyone although i appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
i just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! be safe! skin cancer is a real danger.

tl;dr- sunblock expires.",4
"by watching my neighbours fight while i was eating popcorn.. so i'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally i was watching the match on my living room little did i know there was another match going on my neighbours house. about ten minutes into my game, i started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

between the game and the distance between us i really couldn't distinguish any words, so i just raised the volume of my tv and kept watching. during half time i got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so i lower the volume of the tv as i microwave some popcorn.

by this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as i take the popcorns out of the microwave i hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so i went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case i had to call the cops of something. now i have two dogs so i didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so i brought it with me.

so here i am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. for the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. by now i could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so i thought. suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as i gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

now try to see this from their perspective. they've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. this got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""enjoying the show you \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

i honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. they both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""can you believe this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

when i got inside i was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

edit: i know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments i've gotten.  you all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! also shut out to all the cruz azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game i was watching!

edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a and it probably isn't a dramatic one i'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

tl;dr my neighbours were having a big fight while i was watching a soccer game, i went out to check while she slapped her husband as i was holding a big bag of popcorn. my nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",4
"update: yesterday, i posted about how i almost killed a girl with asthma by dabbing. thanks to reddit, i asked her out. we're dating!. hey! y'all remember me? yesterday, i made this post (https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2pdlw/tifu_by_making_a_girl_i_like_laugh_so_hard_she/) about when i almost killed a girl by making them laugh so hard it caused an asthma flare-up. well, thanks to the incredible support of the reddit community (i got hundreds of pms urging me to go for it yall be crazy lol) i asked her out. and guess what....

after promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! we're going out this friday for a dinner. i know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what i happened i think i'm kinda obligated by the universe to go for it. 

thanks for giving me the support to do it guys. i was gonna flake-out.
so remember ladies and gents, if you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them. if it works with the haters, it'll work with the lovers.

tl;dr. gave a girl an asthma attack by dabbing on them. they laughed too hard and ended up in the hospital. reddit made me work up up the courage to ask them out. somehow it worked. what the hell.

"by telling both my wife and mom about an item on ebay i wanted for my birthday...they unknowingly got into a bidding war against each other and drove the price up considerably.. so my birthday is coming up and i found an item on ebay that i thought would be cool as a present. i figured i would casually mention it to both my wife and my mom...not thinking that either of them would actually try to bid on it.

well lo and behold, they both ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! they ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. they could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!

"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me. as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

"by trying to buy an instant pot at target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist. this started yesterday but i didn't realize my fu until today.

yesterday, i stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt instant pot at target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. i decided i would get some christmas shopping done early and flip a few. i ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. i go to target and give them my id, they look it up and can't find it at first. i give them the order number and i hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. the one says he has to let the manager know i'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but i didn't think much of it.

fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. the doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. i step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the state police counter terrorism unit and they start questioning me about why i'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if i know what they can be used for, if i'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the target parking lot. i did my best to explain the price mistake and how i found it, etc. i think they accepted my explanation but i'm still nervous that i'm on a watchlist now.

tl:dr tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 instant pots at target, got interrogated by state police counter terrorism unit why i was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

"by missing every sign on a date. so didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. i invited a close friend to the movies with me. a few odd things happened, and it wasn't until i spoke to a friend of mine that i realized i missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) beforehand, i jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and i got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). she replies ""don't worry, if that were you and i, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. i laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. i replied, ""i guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. she then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in my car though"". i then replied ""you know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) when we get back to her house, she asks if i want to go inside to get a soda, to which i politely declined because i wasn't thirsty.

tldr: i missed strong signs that she was dtf


edit: there is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

"by attempting suicide without realizing it. so, as i was making myself breakfast this morning, i for some reason started wondering what would happen if i touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. being the very intelligent man i am, i of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. i instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. a small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

the worst part is, i still didn't realize what i had actually just done. i just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. as i grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that i had almost electrocuted myself. maybe i was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. if i had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, i would have gotten an electric shock.

i haven't told anyone yet, and i don't think i will.

"by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.. obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

i had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. i proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! or so i thought. 

about 3 weeks after our proposal, i notice she starts acting different. not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. she had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of m-f each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. i went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when i have work the next day, so i often opted out.

we would also share our google location with each other at all times. mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and i would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. i looked at her location one day and it was turned off. i texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. hadn't been a problem for the past year. she turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. she also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. i only had the location for the personal phone. eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

two days ago, about a month after the proposal, i decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and i just wanted to put it to rest. i used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. she had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. i called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. she said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

i waited until she got home and confronted her about it. she said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought i would get mad. turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. i kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time i asked.

the next day when i got home from work, i asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. she said she deleted them. so i said i wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. i started recovering the data from the last backup. she sat down beside me while i was doing it, and asked what i was doing. i told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! so she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. i asked her one last time, ""before i look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" she was silent. i asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. so that's a win i guess.

planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. havn't told her yet. still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. feels shitty but i'm keeping my head up.

tldr; by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. it has been one month since the proposal now.

edit: wow! thank you all for the encouraging comments! they help so much more than i would've thought. some of these really got to me, and reading that i should've posted this as a lifeprotip made me laugh. most if all, it helped me confirm that it was not a fu on my part, but actually a gift that it happened so early. thank you all, so much! going to read through and respond to as many as i can.

"by kicking my son!. this happened a few weeks ago.

my ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, ""dad! kick me!""

so i did.

hear me out, please. the kick was a 3/10 on firmness. not gentle, but not painful. he's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, i feel like i need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. i also want him to ""lose some battles"", and to learn to ""roll with the punches"". 

anyway... i performed a front kick whilst making the bruce lee noise. i trust that you know the one. 

my son recoiled. he looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. he didn't cry,, but it was close.

he blurted out ""i said kiss me!!!""

oops!



tldr; i misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him.",4
"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended. obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

tl;dr: convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

edit: wow this blew up?! i don't have a ton of time but:

1) i don't want to upload the video. i made it sound tamer than it was, i look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xd

2) the tvs in the hospital had hdmi ports. i just plugged it into my chromebook. 

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4

"by having the best dream at the wrong time. i had the most vivid sex dream the other day. the kinda dream no one would want to wake up from. i was one of the founding members of the x-men, and i was balls deep in mutant pussy. so, fucking was literally my superpower. i could cure the sick with my cum. humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. including the members of the x-men. so, in this dream, i was fucking blink and jubilee. sparks were flying in the bedroom. i mean, damn. i never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. but deep down in dreamland, i gave *all* the fucks. i experienced the most explosive orgasm. i woke up at that moment.

oof. i was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. i'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. especially if you're wearing loose pants. i locked eyes with the passenger next to me. she wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. it had the words ""best mom ever"" on the pillow case. *of course it had*. at that point i realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. i was too embarrassed to really speak, but i managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. she shook her head as if to say ""don't mention it"". and then she said this fucking shit: 

""don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep""

""i'm sorry?""

""i have a son who's also into x-men""

"by telling my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me. this happened approximately six years ago, i was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that i post it here. 

&#x200b;

so, flashback to undergrad, things are good and i just started dating this beautiful girl that i had met in class. i was enamored with her, shocked that i loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. the first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200b;

after a few months into our relationship, i started to notice some concerning symptoms. as you can probably hypothesize, when i pee'd, it burned. at first, i just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, i decided to stop taking creatine just in case. but, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. i would literally be struggling to stand while i pee'd because the pain was so intense. after, i would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. it was bad. 

&#x200b;

well, at this point, i was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. no, it had to be what i thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. i hadn't been with anyone else. i hadn't been with anyone else since i began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. i was shocked. things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had i gone wrong? the thought made my blood boil, until i outright confronted her. i told her i knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. she told me no. i demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. she said sure. (looking back at this i feel like a complete dick). we agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200b;

the same night i confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. she was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. around this time my roommates and i had just moved into a new house. in the process all our belongings got shuffled around. as she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" i heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, i've been pissing out bleach?!?! i instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. she took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when i pee'd. i told my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an std test. the night before we went, i inadvertently discovered that i had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap.

"giving my 17 yr old nephew advice on how to meet women.. a few weeks ago i flew out to fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since i havent seen them in 4 years. the first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. they gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. the conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. the older son ,""alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at hs and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. on the other hand is my nephew ""dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. when i pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and dan. being the cool uncle i let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. as she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my marine corps days. if he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. but dont go empty handed. i suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. now that i think of it i was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. so the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 a few days later it occured to all of us dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. when his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. i however was not buying it. i pulled him aside and got the truth. the boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. he would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. he met a girl and they had been seeing each other. i was happy i could help and could not believe it actually worked. however things went south. 
 a few days after my return to the east coast i received a very emotional call from my sister. she explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""have you seen this man"" flier on the door. it was a grainy surveillance photo of dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. the flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. when she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. now dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and i told i am not invited for christmas. poor dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

tl;dr.  i royally fucked up by telling my 17 year old nephew to meet big girls by hanging out in front of womens plus sized stores with food causing him to be forever grounded and causing  possible restraining orders, as well as me no longer invited to my sisters.",4
"by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer. this happened 2 days ago. so last week i found a thong on the floor in my living room. smelt it like the animal i am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

huh... i found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? it was clean so i put it in your drawer. what it's not yours?

angrily, she answers it's not hers. you just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

i tell her what the hell am i suppose to say. she goes back upstairs really angry at me.

so last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. i send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. it is. we're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... we came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

now the real fuck up. my wife is in the bed. i go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. just texted her and the thong is hers. the only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

you want me to believe that?! that makes no sense

jesus christ, i don't even believe my explanation myself. i tell her to believe what she wants, i don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that i don't have anything to redeem myself. i take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

the next morning she calls me. she tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that i'd put it in her drawer. and if i was cheating on her, i'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

tldr : found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. almost lost my wife to it.

edit : omg it exploded. thanks for the silver mystery redditors! i know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! had fun with the others that told similar stories :) and yes, i told my friend that i sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

edit2 : the thong(https://imgur.com/a/ktgzdeu) in question

edit 3 : wow thanks for the gold! i answered to a bunch of you, but i'll not be able to keep up! there's too many comments! i hope you guys have a nice day!

edit4 : addressing some comments. no i don't think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. yes i have the right to hang out with other women and have a drink with them. my wife also has the right to hang out with other men and have a drink with them. finally, my friend's fabric softener is fleecy.",4
"by creating a special handshake with my daughter (nsfw?). this is an ongoing tifu, i am actively looking for ways to end it.

my daughter is 3. she is the light of my life and all that. because she isn't much for drinking or golf, i have had to find activities we both enjoy to pass the day. this means we spend a great deal of time watching movies. my favorite is e.t. and i figured she'd love it too. wrong. e.t. is terrifying to a little girl. in an effort to make e.t. fun, i taught her the fingertip touch ""ouch"" thing and then we watched that scene a few times in a row. it went well and now e.t. no longer scares her. win.

she has held onto the fingertip touch and it has taken on a life its own, a bit like a not-at-all-secret handshake for us. we always do it before she goes to sleep.

her: *puts out finger* finger!

me: *touches finger* ouch!

super cute right? well... she has now taken to doing it anywhere, at any time. it became pretty annoying and when i tried to curb the frequency of it, i was met with disaster. last weekend we were at the mall when she announced loudly in a quiet jewelry store that she was going to give me the finger. a little embarrassing but not too bad. i told her that she can't say it like that because ""the finger"" sometimes means something bad. she nods, understanding and the moment passes. a few days later, at dinner with my in-laws, the handshake returns to the forefront of her mind. mid-meal, she says, ""finger! oh no wait, that's bad..."" she then thinks for a moment and screams, ""daddy, finger me!"" if i could have turned into a flock of birds and flown away forever, i would have. my in-laws turn bright red and stare at her. i immediately say, ""no no, that's not what its called"". my daughter doubles down, ""yes! finger me! ouch! remember? ouch!"" i nearly passed out.

we are now trying to rebrand the handshake as ""et"" and ""ouch"" because jesus christ i can't take her anywhere.



tldr: my toddler desperately wants me to go to prison.

edit: holy hell yall, never have i ever had so many people delight in my personal disaster. i am flattered, honored, and rolling in awards. i am finally an award winning individual.",4
"by setting my wifi hotspot to ""bomb detonator"". title says most of it.  i was at a tech conference today.  i like to broadcast random wifi hotspot names to mess with people and after the recent story about the planet fitness  i thought it would go over well as a joke.  i mean, who hasn't seen ""fbi surveillance van"" as a network?

*holy fuck.*  **do not do this!!!**

cops got called.  i got to spend about 45 minutes chatting with them.  they asked a lot of questions.  they had to make sure i'm not a threat.  i cooperated fully.  i have no doubt being a white guy at a nerd gathering probably helped.  i was told i wasn't being charged.  i was, however, told to leave by the venue and not come back.

flash forward two hours and i go to log into my work email on my phone.  huh.  password failed.  huh, again.  ok, let's not fat finger this and lock the account.  pull out the laptop, remote into my work pc.  go to log in.  ""your account has been disabled. contact your systems administrator.""

20 minutes later i get the text message.

*you are being placed on paid administrative leave effective today 5/23 while the agency investigates today's events surrounding you being removed from the <venue>. you are not to complete any work, access agency networks or report to the office during your leave. we will contact you when the investigation is complete.*

tl;dr: immature joke kills career, film at 11.

**edit:**  thank you for the influx of comments and messages.  most of you are right, i am a fucking idiot.  one doesn't come to r/to brag about the good shit they've done.  no matter what you say, i'm trying to keep up.  you're helping me cope.

"by eating the ends off a chicken wing.. yesterday i ate the ends of a chicken wing. someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so i tried it out. i never expected this to happen. 

i must not have chewed one properly. i got something lodged in my throat. to dislodge it i ate some bread and drank some softdrink. some pain persisted but i went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

this morning i woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. i walked to the public hospital down the road because i was starting to worry. 

the gp noticed i had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. he immediately sent me off to get an xray. that showed i have a perforated esophagus. that is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. the ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

to get more information i started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3219576/

they consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. it's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. a few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. they said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

now i'm waiting on the results of the ct scan which will determine whether i get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. if i'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

tl;dr: i ate the ends off a chicken wing and now i'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**update:** a surgeon just spoke to me. i have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. they don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**update 2:** the main surgeon just spoke to me. i'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. the critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. so i can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and i need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.

**update 3:** i had a tube pushed into my arm, through a vein, all the way to the top of my heart. it's called a picc. it's how i'll be eating and drinking over the next week.",4
"by accidentally pulling out my gf's tampon while watching tv. yesterday evening my gf and i thought it would be nice to watch lord of the rings after coming home quite late. after aproximately 4 hours i was really tired and couldnt think straight anymore. she had her ""strawberry week"" so she was plugged, which i frankly didnt care too much about. we just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.

i thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.

i think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.

my girlfriend said: "" wtf are you do-"" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.

after explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my gf couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling gf.

"by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral. this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.
my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

tl;dr got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

"by announcing to my daughter that i only shave my vag when her dad is due home. this literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.

for context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go. 

he realised that he had ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that i am, i offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
he commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and i assured him that that wouldn't be the case as i use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come. 

tl;dr basically the title, and the fact that my 13-year-old daughter has learnt a bit more about her mother than probably either of us are comfortable with her knowing.

"by masturbating in front of my entire family. this happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which i was extremely anxious about. all together, i was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager i am, i often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

so, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, i lay down in my living room with my family, watching tv. i dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since i had done next to no study at the time). 

not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, i decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

and so off i went. except i forgot one thing.

i was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that i was not in fact sitting with my family by our tv, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

i don't really understand how or why it happened. a few seconds in and i began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

i snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment i put myself in. 

i'm not going to talk about what happened next, as i don't want to relive the next few moments.

my father is just disappointed. he hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

my mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as i write this. 

and i'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. i find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe i was just dreaming while i was gassed up. 

but it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

"by buying my mom an amazon device.. i want to start by giving some background here. i basically live, eat, sleep and breath amazon. i need something, straight to amazon. i use kindle and audible daily. want to stream music, amazon music. want a new movie, prime video. run out of something randomly, ""hey alexa......."" laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. so when looking for a place to store photos, i see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with amazon photos"". naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. automatically upload photos from my phone? even better. 

rewind to september 25th, my mom's birthday. i thought about her gift for a while, but when i remembered she didn't have a smart tv, the answer was easy. i hop on amazon shopping and use my amazon credit card to purchase one firetv stick. she was so happy she could watch netflix on her tv now. yay, success! or so i thought. 

yesterday i get an email from amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the fire tv family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did i imagine that it would sign in to my amazon account without even asking for a password. surely she'd have to use her own account. 

fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. sitting in my mother's kitchen, i glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

i spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. i happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. i'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. i took probably 40 pictures that night for my so to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my entire family to view. i have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

nobody helped me. the remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where i'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. i didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, i just ran away. 

the worst part, i asked alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, i'm not sure about that."" fuck amazon.

update: i promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. i talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. however, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

i'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an amazon ad, i just wrote it how i wrote it because i thought it was funny. i wish amazon was paying me for this crap. 

i'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. yes i fucked up, i was a dumbass, that's why i posted it here. yes, i should have known this could happen. call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my so do. it's fun. i don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. it happened.

"by joking about ancestrydna and 23andme.. this actually happened over christmas last year.

my family, including (paternal) my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having christmas dinner. 

my grandfather brought up that he did ancestrydna (or was it 23and me?). i don't remember the exact one, because i can barely think about it. it's hard just writing this up.

it was really cool to hear what he found. he found mostly scandinavian spread out over the british isles, particularly wales. we knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% persian! very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. he's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

the only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of king george iii. the reason why i question this is king george iii is recorded as one of the few kings who never had a mistress. 

however, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of king george iii (we are descended from the woman). he mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

anyway, off topic. i thought it was fascinating, and i love hearing what he's found. i brought up possibly using my christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. i don't think i was really going to do it, i usually use the money to pay bills.

silence. and it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

my sister and i look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. my parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. we look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. i have weird hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. my sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

i always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. i never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair i have such cool pretty eyes. 

well, okay.

dad starts first. dad (d), mom (m), sister (s), and me.

d: there's a chance 3ar3ara_g0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

s and me: imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. my sister grabs my hand (i love her big sister ways).

me: okay, um... 

d: your mom never had an affair. this isn't some cheating story.

me: wha.. (i start to feel very sick).

m: i hoped to never have to tell you this. i was raped. the reason we're not sure is because your dad and i had sex earlier that day.

me: (i want to die, i start crying). everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

d: your grandparents know.

s: okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

m: no, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

me: he's still out there?

s: but obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

my dad and mom look at each other. 

m: it was my brother.

i felt so sick. i felt... dirty. i had to run to the bathroom to throw up. i couldn't stop shaking. my sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. we probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

the rest of the vacation was just weird. if it weren't for my nephews, i'm pretty sure i would have just gone home.

oh my nephews are wonderful.

well, we came home, and i had to battle with the ""do i want to know?"" thoughts. i could get a dna test. but i couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. but it weighed on me too much. i had to know in order to move forward. so i asked my dad if he would submit his dna with mine. we weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. it was hard asking him to not say anything to her. he should be able to talk to his wife.

so we submitted the test. 

i am my father's daughter. i cried when i got the results. it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

i made a decision not to tell my dad - i wanted to surprise them. i kept saying i hadn't gotten the results back. i did tell my sister though.

i gave them the piece of paper on mother's day. i was going to wait until father's day, but i couldn't. so i got a blank card. 

inside i wrote: ""mom, open the paper."" she opened it and i had written happy mother's day, and happy early father's day. 

lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

thank god.

edit: left out half a sentence, oops. 

it was my uncle on my mother's side. i have met him. my sister and i were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

my parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there i guess was his reason. plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

my mom didn't go no contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. why that long, i have no idea. those are her reasons. 

she did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. i guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

grandmother is dead now.

this happened in louisiana.

"by my wife and i referring to ""no"" as the ""n word"" with our 12 month old son and having child protective services called on us. so my wife and i have a four year old and a one year old.  when our one year old is up to mischief and we tell him ""no"" he immediately looks up at us and starts crying.  it's actually pretty adorable.

in order not to upset him we frequently refer to it as the ""n word"" when he's around.

"by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother. now this didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and i am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

so, a few weeks ago i was at my gf's house, usually the plan when i go is i sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch tv, play games and other stuff. everything was normal, i chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general tv.

this is where the fuck up happens.

after around an hour or so, me and my gf were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

i'm enjoying this more than i ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since i started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

she starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. literally within less than 30 seconds, i'm already ready to release my load, i try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but i just can't, it feels too good. 

right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst i'm there in my birthday suit. my girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock i release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

i sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. my girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then i hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

although me and my gf are still together, i haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

"by being funnier than my so and allowing her to post it on reddit.. this happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

last night while my so was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. she is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. so i jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

while i'm making my journey, i decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. i'm in a pretty great mood. i had the day off and my so was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some new girl. 

my journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. just open desert. so while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""what can i do to add a little romance to this situation? cover the bed in some dove chocolates? maybe some flowers?"" 

i make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. miraculously, i made it back home before her.

finally i decide, ""nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" so when i get home, i break open the box and spell out ""anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

so gets home and goes straight to the room to change. i follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

she takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

i've created a monster. 

tldr; spelled out ""anal?"" with my so's tampons. she thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. reddit agreed and now she thinks she's famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

edit: wow! my first ever medal. thank you kind stranger. now at least i can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.

edit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.

edit 3: we are ending this ""contest"" at 11:59 pst on 7/17/19. it looks like i am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, i would like to say a few things... i had no clue this would blow up like this. i thought i'd get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while i've been in here for a year. this has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while. 

that being said, please go show her some of that love i know reddit is so capable of showing. she is truly my better half and deserves all the attention and happy comments.",4
"being jesus. this happened on halloween. i imagined the evening going down more or less like this: 

1. slip into a white robe.
2. stick on a cactus crown. 
3. moonwalk out of the house as jesus. 
4. remember never to break character. 
5. hop into an uber. 
6. show up to celebrate halloween with friends. 
7. go ham.
8. go home. 
9. go sleep.
10. go for a job interview the next morning.

this is what i would've called a good night. however, after #7, things didn't quite go as planned. here's how shit actually unfolded:

8. got shit-faced.
9. drunk me turned into drunk jesus. 
10. fell into my friend's swimming pool and almost drowned after attempting to walk on water.
11. realized wearing all white, plus water, equals everyone seeing your shriveled up shlong through your tighty whities. 
12. drunk dialed my religious mother in the middle of the night to tell her i'm proof that jesus is fake as fuck and that i'm gay, gay, gay. 
13. unleashed an unholy amount of vomit in the uber driver's car on the way home.
14. missed my job interview the following day after waking up laughably late.
15. realized drunk me set the alarm on my phone two years into the fucking future.

for the record i apologized to my mom. we cool now.

tl;dr fell into a swimming pool, got all wet wearing white, exposed my cock to a crowd, roasted jesus over the phone with my christian mom, woke up late the next morning and missed my job interview.",4
"by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. last october to be exact. 

so backstory. i had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. they just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. they had a lot of reasons. and we were actually planning on it. but we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. so of course, temptation got the better of us. okay, end of backstory. 

she was a senior in high school and i had just started college about an hour away. we rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. we would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. everytime she would leave i would get sad, but knew i'd see her again. 

one time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. no answer. she said she was gonna text her. made sense to me. once she said we had, we got right to business. she put her phone on the bed, and i didn't even 

things went on for awhile. lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. lots of fun. and by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. followed by some vibrating. it was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. then we found it under my ass. we laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. it was her mom. and within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. so her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. and in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

she told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
my girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. i attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. so i drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. my girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. her mother absolutely said i was not allowed over. 

so we got back to our hometown, i parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. she drove home. i called my mom for a surprise ""i'm home for the weekend"". she came and picked me up, and i bawled in her arms. i told her everything. she comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

we got back to my house, and i laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. i cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. for the longest time, i thought i never would hear from her again. then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. she said she was coming over and we needed to talk. once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. she said her parents were calm now, and then i was gonna be able to come talk. i was nervous, but i loved her so i did it. 

when i got to their house, i walked in and instantly just started apologizing. i went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how i was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. we opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

at the end of it all, i learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. but they trusted me. and we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. and everything is cool. sometimes i worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

tldr: my girlfriend and i took phone sex to a whole other level.

edit: holy fuck you guys i went to class and come out and this is what i see???? thank you so much for the gold stranger. my first gold!",4
"by forgetting babies exist.. so i've been spending a lot of time around dogs. i've recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. my reddit is covered in dogs from various sources. my facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. basically everywhere i turn, i see dog. not a bad life to live. until yesterday (yifu i know). i walked one of my mother's friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. it wasn't very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. it's hot. i've just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. i want to blame dehydration for this fu, but really i know i'm just an idiot. a couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. my first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. i don't know. it's a hot day and i've seen dogs in pushchairs before. maybe they didn't want its paws on hot tarmac. maybe they're just a little extra. regardless, the thought that babies exist didn't enter my tiny stupid brain. as they got up to leave and walk by me, i decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words ""what breed is it?"" and gestured towards the pushchair. they looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. it was a baby. a human baby. i'm so glad they took the traditional british approach of confused stare and silence. if they had said something i think i would have disintegrated on the spot. it was a long walk home after that and thankfully, i didn't pass anymore pushchairs. 

tl;dr i asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the internet.",4
"by flashing my breasts...not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.. i've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""early stages"" feels like i joke because i've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

as part of the hiring process for company x, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. it's a lot. i also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but i *really* hate my job. what can you do?

anyway, i pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me i'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. to ensure i'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, i have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

now, when i'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, i'm working from home for my current job. because i wfh, i'm not always the most presentable. we're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. i look bummy. i'm a bummy girl who works from home. to be clear though, i'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

anyway. i didn't take this into consideration when i opened up my computer for these tests. i *really* didn't take it into consideration when i opened up the program to begin the tests. i only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

and then...because apparently i have no shame??? i decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). this was a super sobering moment, guys.

i really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. so, i stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. while getting up, i haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. i took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. that's when i realized i wasn't wearing a bra (why would i be. i'm wfh, remember?), and the shirt i'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. i started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. i pull one out, put it on. dig through my closet for that single shirt i was looking for. find it, put it on. bam. ready.

i flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). getting myself all situated, i went to push record to start the exam.

there was no record button.

instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. it read something like 00:09:04.

it had been recording the entire time. the whole time.

me cringing at my reflection? recorded. me smelling my sweatshirt? recorded. me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *recorded.*

i had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. for an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

i can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when i realized. i definitely whisper-spoke  ""*fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. maybe a blacked out? i don't know. what i did know in that moment, was that i was royally fucked. the recorded video submitted when you closed the window. there was nothing i could do.

and then...because i'm a dumbass, guys. i went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

so. that's it. there you have it. i might now have nudes on the internet. i might get my recruiter fired for nsfw videos. or, who knows? i might get the job.

tl;dr by not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. i may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire hr department.

edit: i'm not going to show you my titties. quit it.",4
"by injecting myself with leukemia cells. title speaks for itself. i was trying to inject mice to give them cancer and accidentally poked my finger. it started bleeding and its possible that the cancer cells could've entered my bloodstream.

"tifu by telling my gf to go right.. i finally get to post a fuck up. happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

my gf and i were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. awful game by the way. anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. the gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

the star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

as she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

which she immediately did.

i have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and i've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. nor have i ever been so afraid. she ended the game with 0 stars...

""i will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

the rest of the game was spent in dread. its now 3am and i'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

goodbye.

tl;dr mario party 7 is a terrible game.",4
"by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today.... when i was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. so spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and i thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  i had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
the googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until i had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out i pushed it even further in. i was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. i could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, i stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. after a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

skip forward to this tuesday;
i do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and i was submerged under water, after i emerged and pulled my boat out i could hear a slight rattle in my ear and i knew instantly what it was.
it's now friday and the rattling happens every time i turn my head and i still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

tldr: put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... it didn't

uptate:
so this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause i think it's abit mental aswell.

however i'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and i'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and i can honestly say i don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think they're as big of thing in the uk.

thanks for hearing me out",4
"by buying a used playstation 2 on letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.. this happened only minutes ago.


the graphics card in my old ps2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so i decided to replace it when i had a little extra cash. i was out browsing different sites like craigslist and the like, when i stumbled upon the ps2 mentioned in the title. it looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


at the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


now, i should preface this by saying that i have a strange faith in the honesty of others. benefit of the doubt and all that noise. after all, the car i drive now is one i bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. why should this be any different?


starting to sound like a mistake yet?


if the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. that is almost certainly about to change. the model the seller advertised on letgo was one of the larger black brick models. like, the first generation ones. when i finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. when he showed me the goods, it was actually one of the slim and silver ps2's from later in the console's production run. he told me he had already sold the larger one.


my first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that i should have walked away when i saw i was being sold something that was improperly advertised. unfortunately for me (and i guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), i was not in the most logical mood. it was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. i just wanted to get this thing and go home.


back at the ole ranch, i hooked up the console, slapped in kingdom hearts ii, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. i'm off work and done with class, what else would i do with my evening, right? i was pretty happy with my life until i realized i had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. strange, but not altogether discouraging. i slapped in another game that i new for sure was working. didn't read. i repeated this several times with discs i knew would work; same story.


now i'm starting to get slightly pissed. i'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


i open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. i've now got no way to contact him. of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. all i could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. that, or i could get onto youtube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. i picked the latter option and went on my merry way. after a video about a quick mod i could make to the system, i was feeling pretty confident that i was going to get the last laugh on this one.


oh golly gee fuck was i wrong.


now at this point, i begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. i manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. it's putting up a little more of a fight than i saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? it was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. with a little elbow grease, it starts to give. i'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. a bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so i can live with that. the further i get it open, the more rust i see on some more critical pieces. i'm sweating again, but holding out hope. finally, the plastic casing comes free, and i experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


i experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


you see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. the first thing i notice is that the inside is covered in rust. the second thing i notice is that some of the rust is moving.


oh, that's not all rust.


*ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


do you know that scene in raiders of the lost ark where indiana jones is like, ""snakes. why did it have to be snakes?"" that was me. except with cockroaches. they are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. and now they're crawling on my hands. and these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. i threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


they're getting everywhere now. i'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. you would think that something caught fire with the way i was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. tiny, $25 freaks of nature. eventually i managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point i grabbed a can of raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


at least, i *hope* i finished the job. i'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point i'm a little too emotionally drained to care. i also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that i *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and i already need a stiff drink.


tl;dr: i bought a used ps2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

edit: hi, reddit! i just wanted to say many thanks for the gold and all the offers for cockroach-free playstations!  warms my heart, and i'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. happy redditing!",4
"by making myself an uncle nsfw. so this started 2 weeks ago

i went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a gf.

 naturally i start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. i get to teasing him about him not losing his v card, my mom is not liking the conversation. his gf ends up coming over, i stopped the teasing i'm not a monster. so i'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. i tell her not to worry about it i'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

i get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. my argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised ying and yang i grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. he grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. saying how a party would be good for him i even offered to go, (i'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, i told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (i know how that sounds). so i finally convinced her she agreed.

so i decide that i need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. i knew my bro was losing it that night. fast forward to the party, i drop him off so my mom thinks imma be there. i pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. well holy fuck did i get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  so now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and i'm becoming an uncle.

tl;dr convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his v card, he got his gf pregnant. 


update 1: so she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. so we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. i'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. my brother is getting tested for sti's i was all over him about that. also thanks for the gold and silver (i have no idea what that does). thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

update 2: everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. my brother does not have any sti's or std's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,i'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. there are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can dm and i can explain what i did if curious, how i got out, how my life has changed and all. 

update 3: *in maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! mother is crying brother is in shock and the gfs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. everyone pray for this child. 


update 4: they are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, i helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. i've started a savings account for him, and my gf and i are going to move into a place with him and his gf to help them out.",4
"by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging. happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

i was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. i noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

normally, i wouldn't think twice about it, but i was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

we pull up to a stop light, and i hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. apparently he didnt see me, because when i said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, i let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

as i turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. the way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

as i'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. it didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

she then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as i'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. the way she viewed it, i was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

the cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

tl;dr i stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. it was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford f-350",4
"by applying for jobs for the past month as ""titty boobowitz"". i've been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and i recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. i should also mention that for almost ten years i've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. it's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. or so i thought. i had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when i received this email from one that i was particularly excited about:

***i have to say when ""titty boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox i got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***i look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

ooops. my stomach fell right out of my ass when i read that. and of course the most recent thing i had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. i tried to do damage control, but i did not have high expectations. today i finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

tl;dr: somewhere along the line while i was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to titty boobowitz in gmail and i never noticed. then i attempted job hunting. no wonder i got no responses.

edit: just because i didn't make it clear - i emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and i appreciated the heads up. we had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. i'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to tons of idiots like me. at least i didn't put ""attention to detail"" anywhere in my resume.

"by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.. this came to a head on sunday night. i've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. she would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. this was fine for a few weeks. then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. i dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. that this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. i wouldnt know.

my mind jumps to affair. the love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. i figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. i basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. she declined, said maybe when she gets back. like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. so i follow her. there is a dennys down the road from our house. she gets out and goes in. im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. i go inside and i cant find her. nowhere to be seen. its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. she finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""how can you do this to me!"" the fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. my wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""you're caught, where is the guy?."" ""what?"" ""dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""there isnt a guy."" ""why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" at this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. in the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on.

""i had to go to the bathroom."" ""we have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""i dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""a dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. i just never noticed, never second guessed it. she stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. so many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. her  shame was brought down by bananas. i could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. so, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

tl;dr my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

"by swallowing my little sister's birthday present. i am so beside myself with shame that i almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

but reddit karma is my mistress and i must heed her sweet call. 

so yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), i was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

now, i cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. i looked at that ring in my hand and i just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a bugs bunny cartoon. my primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

so i did it.

i think it was the next split second when i saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that i realized what a horrible mistake i had made. 

so my little sister runs screaming from my room and i hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as i admitted that i, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. no, i didn't know why i did it. yes, i am an idiot. no one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

so brief intermission from my sister's birthday as i make a quick excursion to the er, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them i was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. they took a couple x-rays and i hung around the er for about 8 hours before they broke the news that i was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

i shat out the ring this morning. 

happy birthday sis. 

tl;dr: i am an idiot and i ate my sister's ring because i thought it would be funny. 

edit: good fucking god my inbox. tune in tomorrow morning and i'll share a picture of the accursed ring

edit 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.

edit 3: front page!! we did it reddit. here's the the divine artifact, as promised(https://imgur.com/gallery/pva6zvh). may it's legend be told for many generations to come.

"almost eating my cousin out in her office. (update at bottom!)

this happened yesterday. i can't wait until it's much further away than that.

so this is a throwaway, i have \*(had) another account where i like to post nudes of myself. that can be your judgement, and why i do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but i do. as a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies i get are from guys. but occasionally i get replies from girls who frequent these subs. my face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. just my... ya know, body.

so i had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. she said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. a lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

she is from a large city on the other side of the country as i am, but conveniently i was traveling there next week (this week). we started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. she worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. this idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. we decided i would carry an envelope and say its for office ""xxx,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. no names needed.

most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared waaay too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. we literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. and lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

so along comes yesterday, the big day. i'm so worked up. she's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. shows me that she is already masturbating. etc. oh lord, etc. i text her and tell her i'm in the building. i get to her office, my heart is racing but i'm beyond excited. i see the receptionist, tell her i need a signature from office ""xxx"" and she points me in the right direction. as i walk up, i see the name on the door. my cousins name. my first cousin, who i have known my whole entire life. my cousin, who i spend every holiday with and am very close with. it can't be, i think.

so i knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. and she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. i just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""heyyyy cousin, i was in town and thought i'd stop by!"" she is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""omg cousin!"" and gets up to hug me. i literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. she tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

i race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. she surely thinks this guy ghosted her, i really don't think she thought it was me. maybe i read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. i'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. i don't know really though. i texted her later and told her i was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. we're supposed to get a drink tonight. i'm petrified and don't know how in god's name i will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  it's hard to reply to all of the comments, so i'll say some stuff here.  she works for a very large company in a very large city.  she told me what floor to go, i honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    i do know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if i wanted.  like i said, it's a big company, and not a shock that i could pop in.

yes she is on reddit but i highly doubt she will see this post.  she told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  headed out for drinks now.  wish me luck guys.  i think i'm going to be honest.  i don't know.

edit 3:  well, first of all, id like to address everyone calling bs on this.  it seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  i agree and would call bs reading this also.   i can't really defend it or prove it (or can i?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, i could give a shit!)

• she doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• she lives in nyc, it's big.  the buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. it didn't occur to me, i guess i was worked up.

• i come here often, it's not that i didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

• in our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  there was no door man or anyone else i needed to get past.  i don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• we didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

• yes guys post nudes to reddit, i would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• i'm 35, she's 26.

• i deleted my account after freaking out, but i'm sure i'll post again and i'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

i decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  and as many of you guessed, she knew. she didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  she figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that i knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  i assured her i didn't, it was really weird.  we slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  we complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  we talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  and then we had another drink.  and then i licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  i stroked myself while i did it, and after i made her cum she helped me out.  we promised we would never do this again, but i think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.


tl:dr - post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin.",4
"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner. happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

edit: clarifying the tl;dr

edit 2, electric boogaloo: why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. also thanks for the silver

edit 3, freud enters the chat: since like half of the comments are ""why would you cry from seeing your dad's dick"":

* we are all americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us
* we are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents
* it wasn't crying like oh my god what will i do, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like ""i can't believe this is what just happened""

edit 4, the (provable) finale: i'm not posting a picture of this man's penis you nasties",4
"by bodyslamming a girl who wanted to hug me.. i was in a new high school with absolutely no friends whatsoever and because i was very socially awkward i tried to avoid any direct confrontations with any individual whatsoever so i never really made any friends.

however in my fourth block there was this girl who i just seemed to have clicked with because out of all the students in the entire building she was the only one i really actually talked to. skip a couple of weeks i'm coming into my class when she decides to greet me with a friendly hug. 

in this moment i was completely frozen because i never really physically interact with anyone, especially females. so in this moment, i go full brain dead and as she's approaching me with open arms i decided i was going to try and be funny and pick her up from her waist and throw her over my shoulder (don't ask why i thought this would be funny, because i honestly have no clue what the fuck i was thinking) but the second she sees me go down and try and pick her up i could just see the complete and udder confusion in her face as she was just simply wanting a quick hug, but as i pick her up just to make things ten times worse, i shout,

""wwe supah slammmm!!"" 

and she's screaming and for some reason my heart just dropped realizing what i was doing and instead of lightly setting her down, i just fucking drop her and she slams right into a cluster of desks making this massive crashing sound in the middle of the room. i went to ask her if she was okay but she started crying her eyes out basically asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

tl;dr i shouldn't be allowed around people.",4
"by fulfilling a cuckolds fantasy. obligatory this is a throwaway and this happened last winter yada yada yada.

&#x200b;

i had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but i still swiped out of boredom. they were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. only boob. there was no picture of her husband. i take a few shots and message them.  after like an hour of talking, i decide to just do it. we never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. at first i was like really not for it, i originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and i was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. at 2am i left the house, and this is where i regret everything.

&#x200b;

after driving for about an hour, i miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped two of my tires. i'm in a shitty ghetto town that i've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how i'm getting home now. i thought i was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. but since there was no turning back now, i decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

&#x200b;

edit: i'm really glad i was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it's at my own expense, i'm laughing with you. a lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. i hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness.",4
"by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital nsfw. i'm still trying to process what just happened. today was my daughters 19th birthday and i wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. i brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something i will never unhear. she was having sex with her boyfriend and saying ""please stop it hurts, stop it."" i ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. i was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. i threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. my daughter was frantically explaining to me that it's a fetish and he wasn't actually hurting her. i told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and i rushed him to the hospital. he's doing okay now and isn't suffering any major injuries but i feel awful. i'm not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and i truly thought he was hurting her.

"by rubbing my ass into a security guard's crotch... out of habit.. normally, students can beep into my school with an id card.

it's rfid, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

i'm a junior, and i've been getting into the building the same way for years. i keep my id card in my back pocket, so i just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. that sounds a little weird to write, but i promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and i'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. as a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our id out to show him as we walked in.

coming in at 8:00am, after years of habit... i was on autopilot.

i approached the security guard, he said, ""id?"" and i nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (obviously i didn't hear the beep, so i guess my brain thought i wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

it all took about two seconds, and when i felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, i suddenly realized what i was doing... but before i could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""woah woah woah! miss! i just the need the id, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

i tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. couple of other students saw so i'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

tl;dr: decided i could bribe my way into school without an id by giving the security guard a lapdance... i was right.",4
"by deleting reddit's #1 top post of all time. happened just now. sorry for my possible slips as english is not my mothertongue. i mostly only lurk around, but this time i decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

i've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. usually when i get depressed at home i start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because i like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

see, since i'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""accounts"" folder and terminating the ones i don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). the thing is i used to have an imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so i decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since i didn't get it by registering at the service directly. i'll omit the details of all the cyber sex i went through with my keyboard and the browser, but i somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so i pretty much forgot about the whole deal. but little did i know.

later in the day i get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. in addition to that i still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. being the total jackass of an idiot that i am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, i decide to google the #1 top reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on imgur (yeah, the one about the senate, with a total of whole damn 310k updoots). i open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise satan himself. of course imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? it can't be this bugged, right? (i hadn't clicked one by then yet). so i click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this tifu.

i'm sorry. i didn't want to. please, forgive me everyone.
i'll commit sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.

"by eating a free gumball..  

i'm 23 years old, and i admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

earlier today i was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. during that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, i thought i would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

i checked four candy dispensers; all empty. one last chance. i opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, i find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. without any thought or inspection, i excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. at the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

so there i am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as i spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. i'm certain i looked ridiculous, and i'm still brushing my teeth.

"by chuckling away being overpaid.. obligatory ""this concluded today"" - i've been working for uncle sam for about 7 years now. i'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day i received a letter from dfas (the guys who actually pay us) that i was overpaid two whole cents.

silly i thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which i could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, the man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - it was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

laughing it off i taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom i work for and why i should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you f-35), and forgot about it. a month later, two weeks ago i get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address xxxxx, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

now i'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before i ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now i'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. being the class a humorous guy that i am, i send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, i kunted et al myself. i lobe me job."" covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

this was a bad play because apparently feds have no sense of humor.

two weeks later, one week ago i got called into my officer's office. not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, i was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

i'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""me, mind explaining to me why i received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, they spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so i thought i'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. patriotism, y'know sir?""

""well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - we need these floors clean for reason and were looking for a class a go-getter to clean them.

apparently captains have no sense of humor either.

until tonight, i've been spending my free time mopping a lot of floor space.

thank you army. i will never forget you.

tldr; army overpaid me 2 cents, i paid them back three and had to mop floors for their fuckup because feds have sticks up their asses by birth.",4
"by wearing a halloween costume to school. this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.

i thought that because it was halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but nope!

not a soul.

nobody wore or did anything to celebrate. i know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion i spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. i'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state i'm only at school like 50% of the time, and i thought ""maybe this time i can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy halloween.

its safe to say i was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if i see someone else with a costume on i might feel better but this was overkill, i'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that i likely wont be made fun of but costuming will always be my passion and someday i will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

"by buying a bottle of wine at the movies. went to fancy movie theater with date. decide to buy a bottle of wine. go back to bar. ask for two glasses. bartender says he needs two id's. i'm too lazy to go back to seats to grab dates id. tell him i'm alone and was embarrassed to ask for just one glass. he is clearly sympathetic. idiot me then tries to sell the story and continue on about how lonely i've been recently. he tells me he's off in a few minutes and insists on watching the movie with me. i try to fight it but i could only argue so much without giving away the truth. bartender is insistent. i text my date what's happening. go back to theater with my new date. sit a few rows in front of my first date. she has the stupidest grin on her face as me and the bartender (jared) sit a couple rows in front of her. he ends up being super cool and bought me and him another bottle during the movie. movie ends. i thank him for his gesture. he didn't even ask for my number or anything. i think jared was just a genuine guy trying to comfort someone. met back up with my date in the parking lot and thankfully she found the whole thing hilarious.

"by looking up my school bully. so a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when i was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. i struggled like hell because i didn't speak a single word of english. the school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while i was there). anyway, i tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. one guy just completely hated my guts from day one. no idea why or what i did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. so that's he kind of person i'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my english in class, in front of the teachers and all. there was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while i was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. i naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. when to leave school and which exist to use. where to sit in class etc. once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. i just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  the only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. i would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. karma has to work right? the world can't be that unfair. 

fast forward 15 years. i haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. i didn't make any friends and i didn't develop stockholm's. i looked him up on facebook. 

he owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. he lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. he is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. this has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and i just can't get over the bullshit i was fed, karma will get him for you. i think karma missed.

"by being oblivious to the notes my fiancee has been writing me.. obligatory ""it's 7 am. this didn't happen today, but very recently."" i have been packing a lunch for work for about the past two months. i pack it usually, but if i'm behind schedule, my fiancee will sometimes help or do it for me.

i got home from work, and we were talking about how the day went. she asked me how lunch was, and i told her it was good and thanked her again. after a pause, she kinda laughed and said ""did you like the note today?!""

puzzled, i told her i didn't know what she was talking about. she said ""the note. the one i put it your lunch today."" i told her i didn't see a note. but the way she said ""today"" made it feel like this wasn't the first time. i said ""wait. have you written me a note before?""

she said ""yes. have you never seen them?"" so apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and i've thrown every one in the trashcan at work.

"by stripping in front of my girlfriends bff's nsfw. it's as stupid as it sounds.

yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her bffs. they usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

around that time i'm usually at the gym so to not disturb them. but yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so i went there an hour earlier.

sometimes after i come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
so i come home early and hear the tv running and i assumed, that she didn't hear me.
that's when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

i busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. some get red and look away, some stare at me like they've never seen a man's privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved wtf. 

the silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. i uttered a loud fuck and she instantly replied with: „good plan, bad execution."" her friends all laughed and even i had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

i even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

"by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""freshly squeezed titty juice"". the repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

my wife and i have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  we found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

while i was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  that rest was very short lived.  the baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

when she read ""freshly squeezed titty juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  she woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  raised with no manners or respect.  she then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

my wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  she passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

i didn't get upset because i'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

tl;dr  i labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  now i have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks i embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days.",4
"by accidentally buying tickets to the red hot chili pipers not peppers. few years back i was a bit drunk and saw online that the ""red hot chili pipers"" were playing in edinburgh...i thought it was the red hot chili peppers! £30 for a ticket i thought it was a bargain! bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).

i am a huge fan of the red hot chili peppers and i was super stoked to finally see them in edinburgh! most bands play in glasgow so i couldnt believe my luck when i saw they were playing in my city!

so we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then i heard some bagpipe music was playing.

i thought hmm interesting...not what i expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in scotland and the capital city i really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

about an hour in i was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but i was waiting for the red hot chili peppers to come out so i could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

i turned to the man next to me and asked when the red hot chili peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

it was at this moment i realised i was not going to see the red hot chili peppers.

tl;dr: bought tickets to the red hot chili pipers thinking it was the red hot chili peppers.

"by making a grown man cry at my work. i debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. but my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

sidenote: this happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

i work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. i had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. he was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes i get who tend to speak down to me just because i'm a girl who works in a hardware store. anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so i said i could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. he agrees and he opens his wallet and i notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. trying to make conversation i decide to comment on it:
(op: me | og: old guy)

op: oh is that your granddaughter? she's so cute!

og: oh no... that's my daughter.

*fuck, i basically just implied this guy was old.*

og: oh cool! she's really cute! what grade is she in?

*guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

og: she's dead. she was hit by a car. a week after the picture was taken 

in my mind i fucking panicked. i literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. and this is what i came up with:

op: oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! it's too bad she died!

the guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. in record time i get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""have a nice day!"" and he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

guys. 

i told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

and that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" that's what my fucking brain came up with. 
fml.

tl;dr - subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**update: holy shit.**

i did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

to answer a few comments: 
*why didn't you just say 'i'm sorry' and move on?*

because that would of been the smart thing to say and as i have referenced, i am a complete and utter dumbass. also, i am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so i was trying to backpeddle as fast as i could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*why would you comment on the kids picture? that's weird.*

yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. but like i said i am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. this happened when i was still pretty new to the job and i had never worked in retail before so i wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. after this happened i learned my lesson and i have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*why do you work in customer service? you clearly don't belong in that department.*

like i said this happened a few years ago when i was still pretty new and i have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. i now train people for the job and i am also a assistant supervisor of the department. i usually tell newbies this story when i am training them so they don't make the same mistake as i did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*did you ever apologize to the guy?*

no, and that's the one thing i regret most of all. i've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. i truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. while i'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

"by putting a rock in my ear, then leaving it for roughly 13 years.. bit of context; i was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. i'm 26 now. 

well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and i had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. it's where i got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

while i sat amongst rubble and dirt, i had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

again, i wasn't bright. 

well. i drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

that said, i flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly i can't remove it. not a single adult was even aware i was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

so when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

i lost my mind.

my dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. whatever really.

either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that i was overreacting.

okay. sure.

let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and i'm in highschool.

this is where the real fun begins. equalbrium (equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. i could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. was a nightmare, really.

i get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" i had long ago forgotten.

all i hear is scrapes.

scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

i'll admit, i immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. that's another topic entirely.

well wouldn't you know, though? the doctor said i was faking, examined my ear, and said i just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. right. it was probably june at the time.

my mom didn't really believe him, but i decided ""balls to it. let's get some hydro-perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

skip along the years a bit more, i'm 18 and i know for a fact there is something in-my-fucking-head. i'm losing it. so i hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""there's definitely blockage. i'm not sure if it's a rock, but i can certainly try to help.""

so this professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of scissor-hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. it was audio torture, hands down. rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

the end results? ""you'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

i'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

the sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and i began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when i reflect back.

let's time jump one last time. i'm 22, couple months away from 23, i have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. great.

but now, out of the blue, i'm losing hand-eye coordination. well damn, you know? i attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

i lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that i could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. but that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

this was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and i locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. in an instant i froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

jackpot.

now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
the pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like i was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

all in all, 2/10. wouldn't do again.

but now it's totally out and i have it put away in a ziplock bag.

i had no real recovery issues i guess. as soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. now it just rings occasionally.

my balance won't ever be the same i feel, but it's fine enough as is. otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, i have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and i get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

not a bad trade out.

**_edit_**: for everyone calling me an idiot, trust me i know. for everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and i've been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. it's fine. this is why i can laugh it off.

"by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants. i've been dating this guy for a few months. he has a fetish for petite asian girls, that i know. but he also has a thing for big breasts, which i attribute to his ""hentai porn"" fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

in the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. he would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me i'd be ""perfect"" if i got some saline implants to fill a dd cup, as a ""joke"" of course. (dd is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34c, but still insulting to me.)

so i finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. i told him most petite asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. he did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great i'd look in a double d while we were out having brunch. 

so i snapped, and i said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. well he didn't take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. he hasn't returned any of my texts since. 

tl;dr: i underestimated how fragile my bf's ego is concerning his balls and i insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

edit/update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. i tried calling him to apologize since he's ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

more edit: i'm very sorry if i gave the wrong impression of him here. words are very limited. he really is a good guy otherwise. i know and i hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. but i really like him (and his balls big or small!). i did not mean to hurt him this deeply and i'm just so sad right now that i hurt him this much. i feel like a terrible person. i shouldn't have reacted with cattiness that i didn't even mean because i like his balls just the way they are!

one last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. not sure where this will go but i guess i'll see.",4
"watching incest porn. *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

this happened yesterday. i was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. i will state, for the record, i do not advocate incest. my girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. all i wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so i went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. that's all this was. research. 

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

i frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what i do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

dad: suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids.

i immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home.

"by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp. technically yesterday and not today, but yifu sounds like some odd anime genre so...

so it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. i was dropping her off at about 8ish and i was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. for the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

anyway, stopped at the summer camp. my daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. i signed my daughter in and then i.... just drove off. in my defense, well, i got nothing. honestly, i just forgot the dog there.

so my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. i now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). she also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. she got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. all in all, could have gone worse.

edit - i get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  sorry, but no can do.  pics include other people's kids and i'm not going to post that.  also, i think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and i've said way too much shit i regret on reddit for that to happen.  just use your imaginations.  she's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  she's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

edit 2 - for those asking.  yes, camp called me.  twice.  and left vm's both times.  number was not one i recognized so i didn't pick up or check vm (i know, tifu!  number is now programmed in).  both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if i could come pick the dog up.  i clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  and yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  huge huge props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

edit 3 - for those asking.  i did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  so i left them an awesome review on yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

edit 4 - yah, i get it.  this could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  yes, it was a mistake on my side.  that's why i'm posting it here and not on r/todayiwasawesome

edit 5 - holy crap.  came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  i just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

tl;dr - dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. dog had a great time and i think she's now a camp counselor.",4
"by having my roomate walk in while i was practicing cowgirl riding.... oof

my roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on sunday night. she usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

a week ago, i ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. i don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. so this was fucking fantastic and i was ecstatic.

my plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so i could sit on it and act like it was my bf. i'm not really experienced in the sex department and i wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so i was going to practice until she got back.

before i get into the main event. i need to explain the layout of this house. when opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that used to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. after leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. however since we got it fixed it's silent.

now on to the main event. i had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so i could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. then i pulled out my new toy and i literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

then i got dressed down to what i would be wearing. it was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath i had my lingerie, i did this so i would be in the head space and so i could i imagine the upcoming day.

at this point i'm on the toy and i had a pretty good groove going and i was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so i grabbed some pillows to support, and then i heard a noise. i fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! i shoo'd him out and continued.

another couple minutes go by and i can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. until i realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. i then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and i felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. i heard the suitcase stop and when it did i hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. i was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

lightbulb!

my shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! i sat myself right back down, turned the tv on rick and morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like i had been watching this the entire night.

she came in and saw me and asked why i was sitting like that and i made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and i was just letting it stretch out. she nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that i was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

we sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. she told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

at this point i'm so sore and by sheer will i'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

the moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. i reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. she does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  i pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


tl;dr: tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

update 1: thanks so much for the lovely gold! it's my first one and it makes me happy! for the record, i am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. i haven't told my bf yet since i'm still a bit embarrassed! but i'm planning on telling him on the day. also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

update 2: since it's being asked alot, the reason i was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. i was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. so there were boxes and all that jazz.

update: i tried keeping up with all the comments... i give lol my pupper has been posted in r/aww",4
"buying my son's halloween candy away from him. my kids go trick or treating. we live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

when they're young we tell them santa brings every boy and girl a present on halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

when the kids get old enough to realize santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

did this with our oldest two and it worked great. they'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the santa thing. we explained the new deal. 

he said ""so then it's my money and i can buy *whatever* i want with it? a new skateboard even? *anything*?"" ""you bet."" ""swear?"" ""yep."" 

he goes and brings us **all** his candy. even every kit kat, his favorite. i was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 i'd spent all week. 

next day i brought the candy to work. then we went to walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. we met at the check out. 

there's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred kit kats for $10.00. 

i started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""what? you said i could buy *whatever* i wanted! you swore! i want my candy back then."" 

his candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. and i did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

so... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

i don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this. 

*tl;dr i bought my son's halloween candy back from him to get the sugar out of the house. he spent the money on twice as much candy as he had gotten trick or treating.*

"by complimenting a co-worker on his weight loss. this happened just moments ago.

i have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  in my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions i rarely see him.  it has been about a year and a half since i have seen him and i was surprised to see him in my area today.  he has lost about a hundred pounds so i thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  i said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  he responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  we aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which i was completely expecting as i awkwardly stood in the hallway.  

when i got back into my office i brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  my office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.  

tl;dr i enthusiastically complimented a co-worker about his weight loss, got a cold response, then learned he was diagnosed with cancer.",4
"by swiping on lesbians on tinder for 2 months.. this has been going on for two months and i just found out today. throwaway account because many know my real account and i don't feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

so i signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. i set up my account...set my interest in 'women' and started swiping. now when i signed up for tinder i linked my facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if i set my gender to woman. i had completely forgot. i'm not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but i was getting barely any matches and couldn't figure out why. figured the algorithms were just screwing me. over the course of the two months i would think ""wow short hair must be the new thing"" or ""so many bisexuals on here"" but never really thought anything beyond that. then this morning i woke up to a new match. she said i looked great, to which i replied thanks, you too! but then she replied with...""how long ago did you transition?"" i thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. that's when it all came together and i realized i've been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

tldr; my 13 year-old self is an asshole.

"by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong'. this happened about a week ago. it still gives me shivers.

obviously, i never thought this would happen to me of all people.

i spent a lot of money on the app store and i think they blocked my card and so i had to call them up to restore my account.

a female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. even at this point i had no clue what was coming. until she asked,

""what is your most prized possession?""

i froze. my head goes blank not because i forgot what i had written for the answer, but because i knew exactly what i had written. the answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

i wanted to hang up right then and there, but i knew she was looking at the answer i had written.

so, i mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""i'm sorry? you have to speak up sir, i can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (fuck), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (fucking kill me)""

""dong schlong. thank you, sir.""

i was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

i've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and i had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

edit:

holy mother of schlong this blew up... thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

and yes, looking back, i should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. but this had never happened to me and i think i just panicked. i'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

gold?? platinum? seriously?? wow, you guys made my day. i'll make sure to keep my shiny medals clean and sparkling :)",4
"by asking for vagina in a japanese convenience store. for context, i'm on a vacation to japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. to show a bit of gratitude, i wanted to cook for her so i decided to go for something simple like a chicken katsu.

i've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. this is the moment i realized that i was out of breadcrumbs so i have to go to the convenience store to get some. i am somewhat decent in japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? no.

as i walked in the store, i couldn't find the breadcrumbs i was looking for so i decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

me: ""sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

at this point i didn't realize that i mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". the staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking i was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. i repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. after the change of the staff's expression, i realized that i fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. i then explained that i mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

tl;dr i mistaken the word panko(breadcrumbs) for the word manko(pussy) asked a convenience store staff for pussy",4
"by closely following a woman around a lingerie store. this happened just today. i (male) was in a lingerie store with my girlfriend, she was shopping for new underwear and i was just following her around, bored as always, staring at my phone to keep myself occupied.

after about 5-10 minutes a man grabs my arm, i turn and it's the security guard. he asks me to leave and starts escorting me towards the exit. i'm confused about what's happening and look around for my girlfriend, who i can't find.

apparently at some point, while not paying attention to anything other than my phone, i'd stopped following my girlfriend (who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers) and instead had started following some other random woman who was wearing similar clothes. i'd apparently been doing this for at least a few minutes, silently standing closely behind her as she browsed underwear and following her to do it again as she tried to move away. she'd alerted a member of staff with a horrified look towards them.

tl;dr started following a stranger who i thought was my girlfriend and creeped them out",4
"by leaving a dildo on the table and ruining my sons life. this happened saturday night into sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. also no throwaway because whatever. 

we have a 12 yr old son. 

saturday night after he went to bed, husband and i decided to get a little sex in. after quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the ""toy"" box. husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (he was putting new batteries in them, etc). he comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. we wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says ""what is that on the table?!""
...i immediately realized the fu. husband did not so he asks ""what is it?"" 
son: a purple banana (ps he's 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
cue immediate shame/laughter. i wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

side note. we did not use that particular ""purple banana"" that night-thank god. 

after we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says ""what do you want for breakfast?"" 
son says ""i lost my appetite"" 

i'm still dying inside. i'm sure son is too.

tl;dr left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won't ever be the same.

edit: ok guys-you realize it's 2019, the internet is alive and well, and 7th grade 12yr old boys are exploring etc right?! it's not crazy that he knows what dildos are.

also edit: i didn't treat it like it was shameful and i know i didn't actually ruin his life. but no one wants to think of their parents having sex. we laughed about it afterwards and made purple banana jokes the rest of the day. we are open and communicate etc. i was mortified and still am, because it's embarrassing.",4
"by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments meta. i don't know if meta threads are allowed, but i think this needs to be said. i believe the removal of the ""nsfw only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. the majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting tifus that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, tifus that are actually not tifus at all and serve only as humble brags - by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool i am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

when you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling op out for the story obviously being fake/barely a (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so i really doubt i am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

tl;dr: personally i think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the nsfw weekend rule. these post clearly have their audience so i have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. however i don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day.",4
"by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that i had to be rescued. then i did something really embarrassing.. 


a few years ago i spent a saturday blissfully tripping by myself. i had dosed that afternoon and i started coming down as the sun was coming up. it was a bright, crisp morning and i felt completely at peace. i was shuffling my music and sunday morning by the velvet underground came on. it was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

i suddenly made a decision. i had to make some changes. i had to get my fat ass to the gym.

i was surprised to see so many people. i had thought, hey, 7am on a sunday, i'll have the run of the place. i was obviously incorrect. all the cardio machines were taken. i couldn't just stand there. i was already getting sweaty and i'd been so high for so long so recently.

i saw an empty bench press and went for it. i couldn't remember what i used to bench back in school so i decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. i am 6'2 and 250 lbs. i was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

it was heavier than i imagined. i figured my guns were rusty. i decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. it was all i could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. i let it sit on my chest while i came up with a plan. every time i tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. i decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. with momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. perfect. i tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

the bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. i lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. if anyone heard it, they ignored it. despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. it hurt. i slowed my breathing and just relaxed. it'll be ok, i thought. i got this, i prayed.

*brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

nope, it's bad, this is bad. everyone had to have heard the rounds i let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. the volume was incredible. no one knew i was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. no one laughed. time was frozen but i assume only a few minutes passed. finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. he looked up at me with genuine concern.

""hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............whhhoooooooot.*

to his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. more like a twitch. i nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. i tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. he left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. all i wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. like i wasn't bothered at all.

so, knowing i was being observed, i did this. i stood tall, nodded to myself like i nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *alright*

**fuck.**

**me.**

the door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. i ran to my car.

i can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. there is nothing funny about the clap. it pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. i just wanted to look like a normal human being.

tl;dr i went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak i am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until i was rescued. then i pretended i had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *alright* as if i could alter reality by sheer force of will.",4
"by being young and dumb i guess. *i was 16 when this happened. golden age of fuck ups.* 

i hooked up with one of the girls from my church. we were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. i was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the big g. however the two of us shared one common goal. we wanted to fuck. which we did. but afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". she named and shamed both of us. none of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. 

so thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the deacon's daughter. 

*edit: thank you for the silver & gold!* 

*edit: okay, gawd damn. some of you are sick of all the sex posts. noted.* 

*edit: a few of you are asking how my old man reacted. every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of god. being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. i was forced to listen to ""rehabilitated"" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time. i never had sex with the deacon's daughter ever again.*

"by falling asleep then waking up while my roommate bought his date back.. this happened many years ago! but it still an experience that brings a few laughs. (tl:dr at the bottom)

back in college, i shared a room with a 4'9 dude and he was nice man. he would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they'd all have food readily available and drinks etc. he was so cool. anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if i'd be going to my friends house for the night (he didn't live too far and i had been talking about meeting him one of the days) i was like ""yeah maybe, ohhh i see you want the room tonight i got you don't worry"". so he's all nervous about his date and i give him a pep talk i said ""you're a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!"" he was all hyped up and left. 

i called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. but, he told me he'll be back home within a couple hours or so. now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. 

so, i figured i got plenty of time. i laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. but, i instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he'll be getting home a lot later than expected. still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he'll ring/message me if he's bringing his date back)

then *i ended up falling asleep*

again after waiting for my buddy to message me when he's free to meet. after some time passes i begin to wake up a little because i hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . i'm like ""oh fuck"" he's with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if i ruin their night now by waking up, ""why didn't he text me or ring?!!"". so, i stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. i hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (i imagine cause of the bed creaking). i then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and i'm seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then i i heard moaning like a japanese anime character.. which confused me. anyway at this point i'm still trying to hold my laughter in, i realised i had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so i decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. i grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. the ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so i decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *nope!* as i opened my eye all i see is a 6'7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice i've ever heard in my entire life say ""now say you want more now"" and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming i see my 4'9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. i again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. all the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. 

the next day i got up early, showered and decided to get mcdonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even i felt exhausted after all of that). i come back to the room to see my roommate watching tv as if nothing happened whatsoever. i said ""well tell me about the date? was she nice?"" whilst he grinned and ate his sausage mcmuffin. he just looked at me and said ""it was so much fun we're going to meet again very soon"". 

now, i didn't want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he'll say when the time was right (he did a month later). so, i said ""i'm glad you had a good time"". as i leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do i see?? the behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. i took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. so, when my friend said ""we're going to meet again _soon_"" little did i know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. but at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and i didn't have to almost die of laughter. 

tl;dr - roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn't know his date was another dude, i fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of bob sapp(https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. and i'm 99% certain he ate my mcdonalds hashbrown that i left on the side.

"by fucking my bf into a seizure. i'm going to preface this by saying, no, this didn't actually happen today. it has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

it was our first valentine's day together this year. i woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

i decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. it was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

i needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

this is when things begin to go wrong.

all of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. i glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (he has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


sure enough, he began to violently seize. i go full protective mode and try to help him. he was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

we're both still naked and i have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. 

fight or flight kicks in and i know i must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. i'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. so when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, i go balls to the walls.

i grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting

*clack*


once he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. i drive him to the hospital
and sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. i apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""babe you fucked me into a seizure..i'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
so not only, on our first valentine's day together did i literally fuck him into a seizure, but i also dislocated his shoulder. 

tldr: had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs.",4
"by telling my three year old daughter that i would eat her booty. alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

so my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  and more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""mommy, get my booty! get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. this get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

this brings us to last night. the wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""get my booty daddy!"" to which i reply nonchalantly ""i'm going to eat your booty! nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

i immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""eat my booty daddy! eat my booty"" and takes off running. dear lord, what have i done?! i try to go into damage control and revert back to get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

i took her to daycare this morning, i hope she forgot all about it. i'm dreading picking her up.

tl;dr my daughter yells get my booty to initiate games of tag. with her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face i instead say i'm going to eat your booty! she now yells eat my booty to initiate the game instead. 

edit: a word. also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

there were lots of requests for an update after pickup. all is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. 

for those that got offended, sorry? none of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. cheers!",4
"by getting in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. so this actually happened about a week and a half ago. some pre knowledge. i dated my next door neighbor for about a year and a half, but then we eventually broke up. so the other day i was really hungry and wanted some panda express orange chicken. i texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. i was like ""alright sounds good brother see you in a bit"". 
a couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. so naturally i got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. i got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, ""ummm you're not my girlfriend,"" quickly i looked up and realized ""oh god i am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. i started to unbuckle and get out. i opened the door and heard a thunk. now i'm thinking to myself ""oh god i just hit the door against the curb but when i looked up it turns out i actually hit my ex with the door. quickly i apologized and got out and waited for my friend inside my house.

"by listening to reddit and eating my girlfriends ass, which caused a peanut allergy.. my girlfriend and i have been together for about a year and a half. she is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but i've always told myself that i would never eat ass. i just think it's unsanitary and just gross. but she's dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but i've always deflected it. i decided i might finally give it a try, maybe it won't be so bad. if it's something she would really enjoy it, why not? but then a concerning thought entered my head.

i have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend loves paydays, the peanut candy bars. there is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. i wasn't sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. so i decided to ask reddit.

most of the replies said that it shouldn't be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let's go for it.

she gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. it wasn't quite as bad as i thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. but after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and i could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

i pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her i'd be right back and ran to the bathroom. this obviously made her very self conscience. i was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when i came back i looked like will smith from hitched when he eats the seafood. 

i had to explain to her that i was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. she told me i didn't ever have to do it again, so i guess there's a silver lining to the story.

tldr: i have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

"by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the atlantic ocean on an international flight.. i was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from delhi to london, so i quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as i ran to the boarding gate.

about 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the tvs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

i can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. it didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. the people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

after a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. my travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

as it turns out, in india they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. they're also dirt cheap, so i bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks i'd grabbed in a rush earlier). the pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

and **that** is how i accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.

tl;dr: i made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded. everyone lost their minds.",4
"by sleeping with my landlord. okay so this happened over the weekend and today. 
on friday, i went to view an apartment. i had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
so i see the apartment, everything's great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

i get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. i'm going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

okay so now it's saturday night and i'm just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let's call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

so monday rolls around and i go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

i walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

the woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve's wife. steve looks totally chill, while i'm freaking outside but trying to remain calm. i did not sign up for this. 

anyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married.

"by unknowingly doping for the entire school year. this has been in the making since last september. this is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

late last summer i started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. i'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

though i've always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call i needed to start working out. beside hitting the gym, i also joined a sharpshooting club, and was i was natural at it. over the course of a few months i moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. my aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

i'm pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but i sure as hell didn't. in the meantime a cardiologist said ""tough shit"" and bumped up the meds.

during the course of this school year i was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. the stakes were high, but i was a stone cold shooter. later that day checking out my fitbit, i found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when i had to bicycle over the the range.

flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. my friend jokingly mentioned that i must've been doping to do so well and the dots connected. i googled ""metoprolol doping"", there it was. i still haven't told anyone, but reddit. what the hell do i do now?

tl:dr started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug.",4
"twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died.    happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. on wednesday's our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it's a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. it is normal to carpool all together and naturally i drive my two friend-coworkers each time. however this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we'll call her sarah (changed). she's quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. while everyone is leaving the office for lunch i offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. now here's where the first fuck up happens.
   while on the way to the restaurant sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. traffic comes to a halt and i slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. i check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing i am currently full on honkin sarah's right knocker my words start to trail off. ""damn i hope everyone is oka....."" that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that i was just reacting to the situation. for the next few minutes the car was silent until sarah said ""that's funny i haven't had that much action in a while"" which eased the mood and the car all laughed. and fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying ""ahh well we all have our dry spells."" something i thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. she goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   we get to lunch and everything seems okay but sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so i ask what's up. she told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. i instantly apologized saying i had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that i was sorry. she said she didn't care about that and that it was fine it's just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. my heart sunk. i had completely forgotten about her husband. i felt so bad i instantly started apologizing for everything in the world i felt horrible. my friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. i feel so horrible that i have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. please reddit help me feel a little better.

"nsfw by posting a video of me masturbating to my work group chat. 

okay so this literally just happened. im dying slowly from the embarrassment, and cant believe it happened to me. 

on snapchat we have a work group chat that i post on pretty frequently. well tonight my so asked me to send her a video of me masturbating cause she gets off on that and we haven't been able to see each other in a couple days do to our schedules. i always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. so apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. 

i realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. it wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow 


tl;dr dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat


update: so im not getting fired luckily. im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. ive heard so many michael jackson just beat it references its unreal. the group chat is mostly comprised of people i go to college with. even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. my boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  also holy fuck this blew up! thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.

"by being on this subreddit too much and hurting my boyfriend's feelings. anyone remember the of the guy that suck his own dick in front of his assistant at a bachelorette party? he included a drawing of how he did that.

so my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.

i commented about it and said ""hey that's how the guy sucked his own dick."" 

my boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and i gave him a little push.
obviously he isn't as flexible (just like how most people are not) and i said;

""well it's okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick""

and in that moment i felt as if time slowed down and i can see his face going into this super disappointed look.

and that is how i fucked up by hurting his feelings.


tl;dr: i told my boyfriend he have a small dick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings

edit: y'all need to chill. i never did mention that his dick is actually small (and to clarify, hell no it isn't).
to give more context, it all happened in a light hearted and silly mood. sure his feelings probably got hurt for a while (can't deny that horrified look i saw) but obviously i reassured him and we laughed about it. 

reason i posted this is because my boyfriend is the one that casually mentioned about posting here, and i am curious what kind of reaction it'll get

we are now both laughing at how worked up some of you actually got ;)

"by instead of sucking the dick, the dick suck me. today my cousin bought an 8 inch black realistic suction cup dildo as a birthday present for my brother, whom in horror discarded the obscene dingus. being the saint that i am, i adopted this orphaned device. 

my friend and i provided the poor discarded ornament with a purpose, i replaced the toilet roll holder with our new trinket, which worked fabulously. 

however, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus i proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn i was meant to be... i had reached my comical peak. as we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead i could feel something was terribly wrong. 

i heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. upon my forehead i had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. the curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. 

i leave for italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won't be able to look at me in the eyes. i fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound.

"tifu by not understanding that 3.5 grams can be a fuckload. this actually did happen within the last 24 hours, i'm still lying in bed trying to recover. 

so, weed has been legalized, yay canada! obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. my girlfriend and i had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. but we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

i figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? i mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. fucking harmless. so i spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of mk ultra and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. which were quite good.

we cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. now, i am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. but, i'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *apparently* you should start with 10 mg. see how that goes. but on friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and i didn't feel a damn thing.

we started with two brownies each. two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. i was fine. so i had another one. an hour later, she could barely walk. i didn't feel it as bad as her. so, i had one more. that's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

turns out mj is a helluva drug. jesus mother-fucking christ. we spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. oh my lawd, i had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. my mind is blown. i could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and i had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

we were wrecked. about halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. we just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. my girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. she wanted to call an ambulance. none of this is hyperbole. we're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. the dry mouth might've been the worst part. it was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

we threw the rest of the brownies out. the smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

tldr: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. it waaaaaay too much.

edit: thanks for the gold! and silver! and platinum! kinda worth it...?

edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. i honestly, sincerely hate the waste. but we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. that would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

edit 3: i *did* do research, i just didn't do enough. we have now learned correct math from the comments. you're **supposed** to dose edibles using the thc percentage. this stuff has been tested at 18%. so, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and i had 168... holy fuck.

edit 4: i used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. every 10 minutes i topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. there wasn't much smell at all. i can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**final edit**: some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. for those making **positive** contributions, thank you! we're enjoying them! 
1. they say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *wait longer*! like, a day. it is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. there's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. there's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. i fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. so keep that in mind. ",4
"by accidentally dosing myself with lsd at work.. throwaway.  well it was around noon when i ate my pasta.  shortly after that i found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  i initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee i shouldn't have had.  at 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which i always use for some gym time.  as i was walking out of the office i realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  the possibility that i was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  somehow.  life finds a way.  saturday morning i had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent tupperware lid as the backdrop. some of the residue must have lived through the night.  on sunday i made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the tupperware.  i put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  today i ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  or maybe i laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  i'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since i microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. it did though and by the time i had walked to the gym i knew damn well what was coming my way.   well anyway, i went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  the work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, i started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when i didn't know where i was going, or why.  i pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before i had to take the plunge.  i did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  i cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. my behavior was normal except for when i forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  we had a new team-member start today and i had to give her a tour.   i don't think she could tell i was fucked up but i know i was sweating a lot and rambling.  i now have another 50 minutes before i very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  what a fucking monday.

so i was playing re7 in vr, but it was getting kinda late but i wanted to stay up and play anyways. i started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.

so logically i stand up from my chair( i didn't even check to look, but i'm pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.

somehow my arm got around my monitor( or maybe a cord idk), i also ran into the wall (which made no sense to me because i wasn't even near a wall), and then it happened.

i start to feel hands all around me(my mom), and the feeling of something come in or out of my ear(my earbuds that i didn't know were there), and the sound of my mom asking ""what the hell, are you ok?""

maybe you already know where this is going.

my niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. they're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. my niece (who we'll call l), and my nephew (who we'll call w) don't have many games on their psn account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle i am, i game them access to my psn account, to play my far superior collection of games.all was well for about a month. i knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

but imagine my surprise yesterday when i get this message on facebook...

&#x200b;

""a\_sad\_frog, can you check your bank? ""

it was my brother in law. l and w's father.

""w is playing fortnite and he has 65,000 v bucks, is this normal?""

my heart stopped. their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.i went to my transaction history on psn, and nearly threw up when i saw this(https://imgur.com/a/qzu4scn)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&#x200b;

all told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. by the time i got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. i saw that the playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. that's **fu number 1.**""tell them to stop what they're doing. shut off your ps4. i have to sort this out"".

i immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **nothing**. playstation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. this is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherf\*ng v bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. for all intents and purposes, i have lost that money. the bank can't do anything about it.

so here's where it gets really messed up. **fu number 2**. my girlfriend is visiting family in the us, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. she will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. that was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than i ever could have expected, and far better than i deserved.

i'm not mad at the kids. i genuinely don't think they meant it. i'm mad at myself. i didn't think it was possible, but then i should have done more research. i feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just f'ed. we're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

so, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on psn are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.

**tldr:** left my playstation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.

**edit:** a couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. this is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. it would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **fu number 3** confirmed.

**update #1:** playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when i can contact them.",4
"by fingering a girl. obligatory this happened yesterday. this girl and i had a fun filled day out on the town. afterwards we got a hotel. things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. one thing led to another and i started fingering her. she was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that i was doing a decent job. a good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. i'm sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. i call her name and start panicingly shaking her. she's not responsive and i slap her face. as soon as i did this she starts having a seizure. now i'm freaking the out. i jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. i'm about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. she's giving me this wtf just happened look and i tell her what happened. at first she tells me she doesn't believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. she said that when she has a seizure it's best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. i just sat there in that ""thank god i didn't finger a girl to death"" state. needless to say our sexy time ended right there.

tldr: i fingered a girl into a seizure. she stops and says it happens sometimes.",4
"by revealing that i had secretly hid in my roomate's closet during his pre-bedtime ritual. obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

i lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we'll call them ned and ethan. the three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. the most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out adam sandler's at a medium pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (everyone thinks they're hilarious in college, i know).
the most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. but one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in ned's bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of adam sandler on my shitty washburn 6-string. 

trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but ned was no random college student. ned was the 6'3"" milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. in short, ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. so to me, that meant that whenever ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

so i grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he'd think i had went to bed early), and snuck into ned's bedroom to position myself in his closet. it was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, like this(https://cdn.instructables.com/fya/uc2h/hmvja37y/fyauc2hhmvja37y.medium.jpg). ned's bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so i'd have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and ned, in case i accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. but directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was ned's computer and desk. 
ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, i could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. the 12 inch proximity of ned spiked my adrenaline, and i began to control my breathing. my back was pressed against coat hangers, and i had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and i had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. (artist depiction(https://i.imgur.com/xmlm5bh.png))

as ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. ned did not reach for his glass of water. ned did not opt for the pajamas. ned did not leave his desk. ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

a million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. if i make myself known now, he'd be immensely embarrassed and angry that i had just violated his privacy. but if i *didn't* speak up now, chances are i'd have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. so i was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. it felt like i was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

my hands began to cramp as i awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn't generate an ounce of noise. my legs began to jitter as i compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as i waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell i was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

after ned's satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that i had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and i had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. all critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until i remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. but with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would i get the phone out my pocket? somehow i did, and i texted ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: in ned's closet. was trying to do medium pace gag. ned started wanking before i could start. now i'm stuck in the closet and can't get out. need help.
> 
> ethan: lol right.
> 
> foogama: ethan, i'm dead serious. i need you to help create a distraction for ned so that i can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> ethan: …we're going to need to have a talk later.

right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). it was 10:45pm on a thursday, but i could hear ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **""hello? why yes ned is here. is everything okay? ned! ned come here, phone for you!""** ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. how this never raised suspicion, i'll never know. it was a cordless phone. there was no need for ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. but thank god he did. i bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

i was forever in debt to ethan for saving my ass, and we never told ned. that is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in ned's wedding. there was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we ""found interesting"" about ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, i was convinced by ethan to write ""that he enjoys anal sex with large black women"" because it would make a fun ""bachelor story"" over 10 years after the fact.

but of course that's not what happened. the best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we'd be reading the bride's, and they'd be reading ned's. and of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. i didn't even know her name. i had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

the bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. he immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. i immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. ethan and i waited for ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. we were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr – hid in my roommate's closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride's best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

i've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

edit: thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for ned. ned is a really great guy and i'm sure we'll be fine.

edit 2: i got ""ethan"" to create a reddit account and entertain questions. you can find his comment here(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/duf2fq4/).

"by losing my right testicle in a ball slapping contest. obligatory ""didn't happen today"" but four years ago when i was 17.

also no need for a throwaway account since pretty much everyone i know have heard the story.

&#x200b;

my friend and i were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and i was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" so there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. my friend won the contest and we sat down. i started to feel a little uncomfortable. like someone was squeezing my right nut. it didn't hurt that much when i was sitting down but once i got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. my vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° c sauna). i dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. my friend brought me a glass of water and i chugged it down in one go. i told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. he asked me if i preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, i said i'll have both. i chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually i require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. i laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level i told him that i'm going to head home. i had ridden my moped there so i had to ride it home as well. it was winter and the roads were bumpy. each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but i managed to get home. once i got home i walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. usually i stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why i went to sleep so early. she was worried that i had been drinking or taken drugs so i just told her that i almost fainted and want to sleep now. in the morning when i woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so i rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. she examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. when i got home from school i showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. there they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. we waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that i had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. a nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. i changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. i was put to sleep and when i woke up in the recovery ward i immediately sat up. a nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. they tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. i started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). the nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. they were shocked about my condition and asked me how i was feeling ""as a man"" but i told them that i just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest.

tl;dr had a hip thrusting contest with my friend to see who could clap one's balls loudest, ended up losing the contest and my right testicle.",4
"by ruining a vegetarian's love of gummy candy. i like to have some gummy bears at my desk in the morning. because every day is a good day when you start it with gummy bears. i always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. one person in our office is a vegetarian, i am aware of this. they passed by as another person and i were enjoying gummy bears, i quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer i was like ""oh sorry, right! you won't want these!"" 

they responded with ""why wouldn't i?! i love gummy bears!"" i stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with ""well, they have beef gelatin in them."" 

them: ""what do you mean beef gelatin? why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?""

me: ""i thought all gelatin came from animals.""

them: ""are you serious? you aren't serious right? i love gummy bears. my kid and i eat them together all the time."" (kid is vegetarian as well)

me (now panicking): ""i think i am. i don't know. maybe you're right! i'm 
sorry! you're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.""

they now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. i swear i could see them going through the stages of grief because i know how sad i would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. so by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.

tl;dr by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)

edit: omg. front page. all you guys are awesome! and i'm learning so much! i just want to clarify a couple of items. first, this coworker of mine isn't preachy at all or anything. i just happen to know their choice and respect it, i have no idea if it's for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (yay!). i'm excited about all the dialogue. and feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. but pretty please don't bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don't judge me for eating candy for breakfast. thanks reddit world!

edit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. hopefully it's a bit better now). also, thank you for the awards!! but! it they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears!",4
"by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them.. my grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. they don't go out much from their house. so i help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to atms etc.  i'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. it usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. i also had somethings to attend to. so, when i was done, i realised that it was late. i came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that i'll return his pension the next day. 

the next few days were so hectic that i completely forgot about his pension. i usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which i keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. i use the latter one more. after 5 days, i was in need of some cash. so i opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

i was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. i was so ashamed that i ran to their house. i knew that they'd be angry so i bought some groceries as a compensation. as soon as my granddad opened the door,  i started apologizing. he kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as i was done. i handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

well my guilt was gone and i was again my normal miserable self. i opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. my guilt came running back to me, i walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. i knew i was the cause of this. 

i asked them about it and they told me how they knew i was busy and thought that i'd turn up when i have the time. they didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. i had never been more ashamed in my life.  my one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

they already had a really hard life. they had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. first their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. and i guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. it's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. i guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

tl;dr: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. they didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

edit: this really blew up! thank you random strangers of reddit for all your upvotes.
and a special thanks to /u/grousakes and all the others for your silver and gold. even though i don't know you, i know that you're good people.

i'm amazed that this made it to the front page! 
thanks guys!

edit3: guys check out r/caregiversupport, if you want to help someone. it was suggested in the comments.

edit4: guys i'd like to give you some context. there are so many valuable suggestions but i'd like to mention that i live in india. there are not many services available related to elderly. even the normal food delivery services are scarce.
also i've tried many things but my grandparents are very unlucky. they were doing well until 4 years ago, when my grandpa lost his eyesight due to his diabetes and cataract. he now can only see from one eye having only 1/8th vision and is advised to not to read or write. he used to handle all the finances but now he is unable to do anything.
my grandma is not literate. she dropped out of school in early years and couldn't read or write much. so she can't access any services. she just does the household chores. 
that's why i've been helping them. 
even after all this, they don't let me pay for anything. even a simple thing like electric bill payment is reimbursed to me. it's really unfortunate what happened with them but they don't show it even a bit. they're a proud couple and i really love them a lot.",4
"by not closing the tab of porn on my phone after masturbating.. here we go. this happened yesterday in university. 

so, i wake up at 7 and i have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

i brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. as i am drying myself i pick up the phone to check time and it's only 7:20 yet and i have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and i haven't had a good release since a week. 

i take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching pornhub. i take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. i am all into it and realise i have only 5 more minutes left. i give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

i reach university and the examination hall is already full. here (india) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your exam registration. i take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

the invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. i go to my desk and as i am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. i lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

i try to keep calm and switch it to silent mode and tell myself if i act normally i won't get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

soon after the unfair means squad (they check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. i keep my head down and act like i have nothing. 

one of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. i start sweating and i almost shit my pants. she tells me to empty my pockets and i take everything out and put it on the desk.

 she stares at me and picks up my phone. 

""you seem like a studious one. why are you cheating?"" she said. 

""i am not. it's an honest mistake."" 

then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if i have any pdf or browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she'll let me go. 

my heart finally stops powering a jet and i place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

my heart now starts powering a rocket as i recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. the video paused.  there's nothing on the screen though. no image or thumbnail. 

""cheating from a video?"" she says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

there it is. dani daniels and manuel ferrara going at it. the sound of dani daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

the professor dropped my phone and had a face as if i was masturbating in front of her. 

now i have failed computational mathematics and have to give a written apology to the dean of academics and convenor of examination. 

anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. had to send the link. 


tl;dr : i forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn't allowed and thr professor caught me. she checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.

edit : 

1. for the people who think this is fake. it is not.   
                                                         
2.  for people who are saying why was i failed and now need to produce an apology one even though i wasn't cheating - it is because in india these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. also, i only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. 

3. the porn was manuel ferrara and dani daniels, they don't have much together. you will easily get it with one search on pornhub. if i may suggest something much more better, please try manuel ferrara and the goddess remy lacroix. the video starts with them talking about cup or something. that also is easily available. 

4. about the girl who asked for the link. 

i was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. 

the girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. as she came outside she asked me why did i bring a phone to the exam and even if i did, i could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. i said i could have but my i couldn't think at that time and was afraid. 

after that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. the girl accompanied me to the admin office. i accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. 

it was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. she asked to show me what was the video while giggling and i thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. she started laughing and told me i am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. she remembered my name and my department. then we parted ways. 

for fuck's sake, she is cute. stop telling me to pursue her. i have another exam later. maybe will meet her there. 


the indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.

edit 2: man i have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. i have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. 

thanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. i haven't figured out what to do with them anyway.

edit 3: invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. in fact, that is the word for exam proctor here in india borrowed down from the time when we had a case of britishers. 

thanks for the gold and silver again. open some sort of privileged sub-reddits i think.",4
"by finding my girlfriend's tumblr. so i've been seeing seeing this girl for almost 6 months now. she's super terrific to me, and i really think things are going better than they've gone in my most recent relationships. we met on tinder! i personally deleted tinder two weeks after meeting her because i was that into her. she told me she did the same about two weeks after that. however, a recent instagram post notified me that she had a tumblr account. figured i'd look at it, because we had each other on other social media's (and i was curious)

it's a perfect summer night in 2018. i'm leaving a job that i hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. i turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 am,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&#x200b;

last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. i lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (mag) who approaches me shortly after. she's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. she's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&#x200b;

mag is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the bmi chart, leading me to believe i'm being hit with a bait and switch. they swiftly disprove that theory by literally asking if i ""want both"" of them. worth noting that this is the only time i've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so i jumped at the chance.

next thing i know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. there is alcohol everywhere. they're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. some girl is crying on the couch.

my drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. having been recently broken up with, i know exactly where her head is at. having done far too many shots, i am not scared to console this crying stranger. soon i will be the advice champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

* you're so much better than him.
* he *obviously* doesn't deserve you.
* you'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

so a little background: my current gf and i have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. before her i was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and i'm learning everything for the first time. long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. i said i was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside i knew that i had no idea what i would be doing and would kind of be winging it. last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. so we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. she's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
she kind of rambled for a bit, and i was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. the rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than i normally do. this is all new territory for me, but i'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like christopher columbus, and she's what i think is india. so i decide to talk dirty. her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, i figure this is the perfect time to strike. and that's when i cleverly decided to ask if i make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

her face fell. it's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. i went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. i've been wondering how i could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. we approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. i don't think i'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. 

tldr: i decided to be sexy and asked my gf if i made her moister than an oyster. she doesn't think oysters are sexy.",4
"by making fun of anti-vaxers at my new job in front of my pregnant and (apparently) anti-vaxer manager.. so i just started in this company a few weeks back. i'm your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn't say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. starting this job it was no different.

now, a few weeks later i'm starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. my manager named a few and i said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.

then i jokingly said, 'and nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...

my co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. she raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. it was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.

i guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.

**tl:dr** joked about anti-vaxx moms in front of my manager who is pregnant, and apparently supports the anti-vaxx movement. tension on the workplace ever since have been, so to call, quite high. ",4
"by letting my parents have access to my bank account and student loan money.. backstory- my parents wanted me to learn responsibility with money when i was in middle school so they opened a bank account for me with a debit card. they have complete access to it and can take out or add money if they want to. multiple times while in high school i had money saved up in my account and they took huge chunks out because they ""needed it."" i was paid back in increments when they took large amounts of money out but i still don't think they have fully paid me back for all the money they took. 

fast forward to now and i still haven't learned my lesson of keeping my money in a separate account that they don't have access to. i have to take our student loans to pay for school (tuition, rent, utilities, food, etc). i had $4000 in student loan money in my account last month and i get a text from my mom saying she transferred all that money to her account so she could pay my rent in advance for the next couple months. i didn't understand why she did that because i've been paying my monthly rent just fine but i said okay and didn't think twice about it until yesterday. 

my rent is due the first of each month and if my mom would have prepaid my rent, i should not have gotten a notification to pay it. but i did get a notification and i was confused. i logged online to look at my account and it said i needed to make a payment. i thought it was just an error or something so i called the 24 hour hotline and they told me there was no payment ever made. i confronted my mom about this and she said ""oh crap i forgot to pay it! let me go pay it real quick."" i was relieved but only for a little bit. she came back later and told me my dad spent all my loan money on bills and christmas gifts because he thought it was theirs. she told me she is sorry but they don't have the money right now to pay me back because they don't have any extra money leftover after christmas. so now i have come up with enough money to pay my rent and utility bill and am out $4000. i doubt i will ever see anything close to that $4000 again.

tl;dr - parents have access to my bank account and mom took out my $4000 in loan money to pay my rent. dad spent all the money and they can't pay me back. i'm out $4000.  

edit - i have since created a new checking account online at a different bank and will be moving what money i have left into the new account and will be adding my direct deposit to the new account. thank you all for the advice so far and the support!

edit 2 - i am overwhelmed with the number of people who have pm'd me offering advice, kind words, and even offering me money or starting a gofundme. i'm amazed how much people would do for a complete stranger and can't express my gratitude enough. however, i was smart enough with my money last semester and have enough saved up to still pay my rent. i never thought i would need a rainy-day fund so soon haha. but i am okay and it would feel wrong to accept any of your money. you all are an example of how much good is in this world.",4
"by ingesting my bf's chemo. figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. 

bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. so our sex life has stayed at our normal level. probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

i've been having horrible nausea and headaches. i already have anxiety so i figured i'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

this morning i woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. i google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. symptoms include nausea and headaches. and the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

i've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

you're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. now that i know this it seems super obvious. but uh, guess i was too horny to think it through.

tl;dr did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it

eta: thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

to answer as many questions as i can and also because i feel mildly defensive: he is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. there is no cure but no timeline either. we probably have a few more years. he is in excellent care at a renowned university program. we adore his team. i've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. this was not reviewed with us, only side effects. the separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. we didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. but it is mine. so all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. we're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. or they just forgot. or they figured we'd read the info. shit happens. 

edit 2: please stop hitting on me in my dms, jesus fucking christ ",4
"by letting my boyfriend have a lie in.. obligatory just over a week ago comment. so i have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we've only been together three months. and also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

ragebeak belongs to me. it is a saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. still, i thought being a saturday i'd take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

i fell down the stairs. still holding very small parrot and my first thought was oh god dont crush him so i threw my hands up like i just didn't care and...

i broke my back.

and then when i finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) i passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like the dead and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

tl;dr removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. right in his face.

edit - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so i'm not paralyzed and there shouldn't be any life-ruining effects. i'm just on bed rest and lots of pain medication!

thanks for the silver! and gold! and the poo! and all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)

"tifu by having a threesome. my girlfriend and i have been together for several months now. we only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend i fucked up. 

her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. they were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and i was involved. we went to the bed and started fucking, but before i went inside her friend, i looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

she said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. after a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

my girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so i thought. i called her the following night cause i felt extremely guilty. she said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. she simply asked that i never do it again. 

come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. i absolutely love her so much but i let lust get between us. 

i really fucked up guys..

tl;dr: i fucked my girlfriend's friend with her and then she broke up with me because she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends.",4
"by getting titfucked nsfw. so setting the scene, finished my last final, tired as shit. so, what do i do go to a bar. there i am chilling and this guy buys me a drink we chat and we hit it off hes really cool hes from my home town and we just really relate to each other really well.


fast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. we went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. i dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if i won he would get graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those graham cracker christmas houses, yes it was spring, yes we were wasted.


so the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. the liquor probably helped a lot but i thought it was hot as fuck. he starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and i close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. not a second later i hear a girl screeching. it scares the shot out of me so i scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. the guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and i'm still laying down and i cant see shit. she runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. 


i dont really know what i was supposed to do so i just kind of took a shower and left. their shower was really nice though. it was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.


overall
guys looks: 8/10 nice beard

sex: 9.4/10 nice and steamy 

cum in eye: ß gritty?

shower: 10/10 really cool

"tifu by accidentally revealing to my whole family that i masturbate every morning. 
this happened a couple hours ago and they're still laughing


i was visiting my parents house for dinner with my family, and almost everyone in my family *of 7*  got apple watches recently and was talking about fitness tracking and heart rate monitoring *they're all health nuts* and we got to the topic of resting heart rates and sleeping patterns and i was looking at my sleep monitoring and realized that my heart rate aggressively spikes every morning when i wake up so i brought it up with them and everyone was trying to think of what i could possibly be doing in the morning that causes my heart rate spike to an active heart rate so quickly. my sister and mom realized at the same time and started dying laughing until i realized what the first thing i do in the morning...

tl:dr family looked at my heart rate patterns and figured out i masturbate every morning.

"by ordering food online amd essentially setting restaurant on fire with the help of bee movie script. ok guys, gonna make it short. this happened like a year ago, but i just remembered it and wanned to share  


it was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  
so i got an idea, to ""prank"" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. thats where the fu happened. few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, ""wall"" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)  
the next day i read in local newspapers, that the exact restaurant caught fire because of some cash register malfunction

tl;dr: ordered food online and set restaurant on fire by pasting bee movie script into the order-note box

"by burning 700 lbs of marijuana and getting half of the military high.. while overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. we usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. enough pot for a lifetime. the pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. sometimes taller. it's grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. it's a remarkable sight. 

for those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, i would like to clarify… i never touched the stuff overseas. far too terrifying. they also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there's another reason to steer clear.

anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. well one day while searching a suspected hme (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. if you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. my mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. a literal fortune. this looked like the hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

a genius counterpart suggested that we bring mt. kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

""well that's a clever idea!"" i thought, relieved that we wouldn't have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

ah but ambushed, we were. the bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. i ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&#x200b;

the early effects weren't bad. the smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, tower 3. jokes went around as we awaited the results. coughing could be heard immediately and the private in tower 3 called out to us: 

""hey we need to…. we need to… do something… like… now?"" i could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

this was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

""sergeant, i'm… i'm high as shit!"" he yelled moments after. i panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

""someone, relieve him!"" (genius)

several individuals raced to take over tower 3. we devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. how perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. like a lazy pot-nado. around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently tower 2. several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

""who the hell approved this!!?"" the first sergeant yelled

""i believe you did.."" the co responded 

""well where's the detail that brought it in?"" 

""that would be us first-sergeant"" myself and a couple others. i thought back to the decision-making process and realized that i had a ton of responsibility in the matter. in fact, i was *really worried.* abnormally concerned… i felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking ""ohjesusohjesusohjesus i'm going to get caught...!"" it was in that moment that i realized, i was sketching. i was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

i turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. my leaders did not need to see me drool. i hazily walked back toward tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other's laps, goofing off, and having a 'deep philosophical conversation' about a bug's journey through life.

inert.

i wrote tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward tower 2 to see if i could help, a big stupid smile on my face. they seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. i started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. we theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the tower 2 crew.

i assume the wind was completely dead now, as i remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. **here**(https://imgur.com/a/lvzqg8f) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

at this point i thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. here i was reunited with half my squad. instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and i could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

although i was personally quite effected, i think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. a lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. i did not personally see it. i came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where i belonged. i theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. no repercussions followed.

 

tl;dr – tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.",4
"by accidentally assaulting a child in a public park. so today was pretty f*cking eventful. 

first, obligatory backstory: my best friend and i often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it's a lot of fun when everyone's enjoying themselves and letting loose. one weekend, my best friend's older brother came home from croatia ( first time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. he offers me if i want to come but i want them to have quality bro time so i pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.

it just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (we'll call him l) got into a fight with another group of guys. although he and his bro didn't sustain too much damage from the fight (the other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) l and i got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. it would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.

we caught up and chilled at a local public playground (keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we'd deck the other and how we'd essentially easily f*ck the other up. we began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. 

it was just two 18yr olds messing around. 

all of a sudden, i say something stupid in a mock japanese accent (i'm asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at l, when this child that couldn't be over 8 jumps in and says ""hiiyaahh""

i couldn't stop my momentum and proceeded to yeet this kid into the sandpit... 

no amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.

i went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. he wasn't seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. 

his older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. i apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying i talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.

his bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. all in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and i got to kick a child in the face... win-win.      (that's a joke)

tl:dr
best friend and i were pretend fighting in a public park and when i attempted to do a ridiculous kick i saw on ufc, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. worth it.

edit: holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, i am not worthy of this. i made this post at 12am last night and when i woke up, i was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. 

i appreciate you all!

edit #2: i didn't make one point clear enough regarding the playground. besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. l and i made sure that our presence wasn't making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn't have even entered the playground area at all.

hope that kinda clears some shiz up",4
"by unintentionally betraying the trust of my new kitten. (nsfw)?. obligatory, wasn't today, but 2 days ago.

so my gf and i adopted a new kitten a week ago. she's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or i go. she also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and i had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as i had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. so i went into the bathroom and began to pee. as i was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all i could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. i looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. i started screaming ""oh fuck!"" and managed to pinch off my stream. the kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as i pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. this all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

it took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. i set her in the tub and i had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. i got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. the last few nights i've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. i dont know what shes planning, but i'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

my girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that i pissed on our new kitten..

tl:dr - i gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... to my new kitten...

"when using the shower head to masturbate. alrighty it's now the morning after;  i am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won't stop laughing at me. 

last night hubby & i had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. 

as usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. one of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉

as a 35 year old woman i had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. sure, i have toys (i'm no prude) but i had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

the night ended and we went home. smelling of the bonfire i tell hubby i'm having a shower & he says he doesn't care, he's going to bed. 

i should admit i was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an uber in case anyone's concerned we drove under the influence). 

i'm washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. ok, imma try the shower head... 

ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

ok feels better but i could still use more pressure.. 

ohh ok that's just right. yeah that's the spot... oh yeah that's the spot!!!!! 

...screaming: ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

just as i was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. i slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as i managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

hubby came running in and i'm telling you it was a fucking sight. 

i'm planked from the shower across the toilet (in like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while i'm crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

i fucked up y'all. 

it takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that's ever happened. 

i managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. lucky.

anyway we went to the ed because i did have a few decent cuts but i only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. again, lucky. 

i told the nurse & doctor that i slipped while cleaning the shower. you know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

i'll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

tl;dr went to town on myself with the shower head, as i orgasmed i slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ed for a few stitches.

edit: changed the tldr for u/nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate

edit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. thanks for the awards too. 

to answer the biggest question: i was embarrassed and panicked when i said i was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying i slipped. stupid i know, but none of us are perfect. 

to all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can't so you've got that 😂

to the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think i'm a man, who slid into my dms just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. i'm not responding to anyone who attacks me, it's pretty sad you've got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it's just not needed. 

i've also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and i've learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you!",4
"by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.. okay, so by standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony i unintentionally put myself through, i think it qualifies.

i have fairly weird-sized feet.  they're very wide, but not all that long.  i have no arch to speak of.  i'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  i'm pretty short so i should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

wrong.

when i was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure i had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

as an adult, i assumed, well, since i'm full-grown, i should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  for me, that's a size 10 (us).

problem was, i kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, i'll switch to size 10w.

still no luck.  still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  my running shoes were so ill-fitted that i actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

my friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5w nikes.  i said, ""sure, fuck it, i'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

oh.  my.  god.

it was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  i was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  i had no idea how much misery i had been in until i wore those shoes.  i wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because i was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  there's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

tl;dr - i'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years i have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because i was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",4
"by going blind and posting in r/pics. by going blind and posting in r/pics 

a friendly redditor u/kevindavebob suggested i post on so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). this is certainly a and it all just happened so i'm still feeling pretty terrible about it.

i have a rare disease called usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. one of the ways i cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever i can to create visual memories before i go blind. i went to iceland to try to see the northern lights. i can't even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. i didn't know if it would be too late for me to see them. 

i really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for usher syndrome. only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, i certainly can't capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. i was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. the photo has been linked so many times that i didn't spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).

with my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, i posted in r/pics. i chatted with a few kind redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about usher syndrome. then i went to sleep….

well, all hell broke loose.

my post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. i woke up to thousands of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me i don't have my disease, redditors telling me they're happy i'm going blind if it is true, that i should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones i won't write here).

i wish the mods took my post down while i was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite reddit telling me i was a fraud. it then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where i got even more hate. i didn't say it was my picture, but i didn't credit the photographer. i seriously fucked up.

i can't even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. living with usher syndrome is not easy. there is no cure and it's terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. my vision especially. i want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for usher syndrome to discover a cure. not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. 

i was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, i didn't make the effort to credit the photographer the way i should have. i fucked up reddit. 

i am getting so much hate now, even outside of reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. i'm sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. we have too much negativity in this world and it's got to stop at some point. 

thank you to everyone who was understanding and realized i made a mistake. thank you luke stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. i'm sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.

from the bottom of my heart, i am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.

i really did fuck up, though. 


tldr; i tried to raise awareness for usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, luke stackpoole. my post made it to the front page and reddit now hates me.

edit: a nice redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested i share the non-profit that donates to usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don't want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - the usher syndrome society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org. also, full disclosure: i am on the board of directors and it's a pretty amazing organization!",4
"by escaping an escape room.. a friend-of-a-friend has apparently been into escape rooms for a while now, and finally decided to create his own as a halloween party experience for his friends.

since i don't know him, and wouldn't realistically be coming to the party, i agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. it ended up being a group of four people who totally didn't know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.

our host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. don't break anything, no answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. he was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn't there. this was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. he wore a black mask and black clothing.

immediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. as i mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. i didn't want to be the ""guy who's super excited to lead the group"", and i guess they didn't either.

the escape room was history-themed. computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. lots of books stacked around.

the first thing i did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.

i put in the first relevant number i thought of, 1492, the date christopher columbus landed in the americas.

lock opens.

things got a thousand times more awkward.

i apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. the host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as i could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. he didn't call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn't say anything rude.

soonafter, i decided it'd be better if i just left, apologizing again.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.

&#x200b;

**edit:** was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad i tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. i can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but i appreciate everyone assuring me i didn't fu. i agree with you on principle i suppose, but i also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. the escape room was ""intended to be easier than normal"" for the guests, the majority of whom haven't done one before. dunno if that's legit or an excuse, of course. thanks for all the positive responses!!",4
"by making everyone in the elevator think that they were going to die.. alright, so this is an old story, but when i found this sub, i had to share.

when i used to be a muslim, i had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

i was on holiday the day of the fuckup. i got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the paris attacks. there were roughly six people in it. then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. for those who don't know, the adhaan starts with allahu akbar. when that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. i had to explain to them that i wasn't a terrorist. then everyone just started laughing.

i understand that everyone may think this isn't a fuckup, but i feel like i shouldn't have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the paris attacks.

tl;dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks i'm about to blow up the elevator.

edit: holy fucking shit, this post has blown up.
thanks to the people who awarded me silvers and gold:)

i need to clear some stuff up first:

when i meant laugh, (ik, that segment was worded horribly) i'm not referring to full out laughter. just some chuckling and light laughing(if that's even a thing)

please stop with all these questions about my religion, let me make this clear, if you message me about my religion, i will not respond. so stop.

and one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn't seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what i wrote first :)

and to all the haters who are send messages to me calling this story fake, i really don't care if you think my story is real or not. i'm not here to argue  about whether this actually happened.",4
"by going to bed drunk.. so last night i went out as i do every saturday.
when i got there i met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than i could handle. after that i went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as i was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

i woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. it was cold and i couldn't move it at all.
at first i didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because i sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. however today i slept with my arm under the side of my body ( i got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. after about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement i woke up my parents and after i explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

during my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
however my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. after getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which i hope i never do again) i waited for the results. a little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

it appears that i have done damage to a nerve with my hip while i was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (i'm right handed) fingers . at first the doctor didn't know how i managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after i told him what i have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

now i'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

tl;dr: drunkenly fell asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves.",4
"by falling deeply in love with my own smell.. this didn't really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. this is a throwaway because i'm very embarrassed. sorry about formatting, i'm typing this on mobile. my girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. it was a horrible event and i still haven't been able to get back into the game since. i was and still am very much in love with her. now to the fuck up.

my favorite possession of all time is her pillow. it smells like her, and i usually sleep with it every night. i haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (i know, gross but i don't think straight anymore). i hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. but this morning when i went for a particularly long morning run i started smelling the smell. really strong. it confused me but i wasn't going to start complaining.

this morning, about 20 minutes ago i arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. and the smell grew more pungent. this was the moment i realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, i got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. i'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell i thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

tl;dr- slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.

"by being accidentally racist. so this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



recently ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so i thought i'd go along. 

so anyway here i am about to play my first game of chess ever. i sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (i should now mention my opponent was african american). the chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

i think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

so i grab a pawn and slide it forward, then i look up expecting my opponent to make his move. instead i'm met with a look of confusion and horror, i begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

i then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" i murmur. 
the teacher nods. 

now everyone thinks i'm a massive racist.

"by dating my cousin for 5 months. you hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

i was talking to this guy on hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, i thought he was the one. after exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. we dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn't had time to meet each other's parents. instead of doing the traditional, i'll bring you over to meet my parents, and i'll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. you can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend's mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(uncle's daughter). it took her a second to realize as well. since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn't seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and i moved to the same city. we could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn't right to do. that was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. i told my friends that it didn't work out and silently removed everything from social media..

tldr; dated a boy from hinge for about 5 months, and discovered he was my cousin after our parents informed us while out to dinner

"by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when i took them out. happened this week and i just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and i felt inspired to share my own story.

context: i've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. my childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as i fought them off, and surgery. i've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. my mom and i honestly lost count because there were just too many. my last tube set was put in when i was in 5th grade i believe. i was around 10 or 11. 

i've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. in fact they've helped a few times! i feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. it's awesome. 

so here's where the issues started. 4 months ago i started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. i ignored it because at this point in my life ent doctors give me a lot of anxiety. but the symptoms started getting worse so last month i bit the bullet and went in. i saw the same doctor i had seen and a child. i couldn't believe he was still alive! he told me i developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. i knew this day would come so i agreed.

my surgery was last thursday and immediately post op i realized things were off. my ear popped more times than i could count and i realize i feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. my hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. usually i blast my damn music in my car but now i drive around at 6 volume. and finally my voice has changed. the way i sound to myself it's completely different to what i've come to know over the course of my life. i can't really tell if i'm whispering or shouting just yet because i've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. the kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. i guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! i genuinely did not. 

parents: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood. 

edit: thank you for the gold! thank you so much for the platinum!!! thank you for the silver!!! 

tldr: i've lived my entire life with tubes in my ears and they were effecting my life in more ways than i realized.",4
"by slapping my teachers ass. so basically i was in class with one of my friends who takes the same subject, he was super energetic and always wearing semi-formal clothing.

this is in my relaxed electronics class where everyone moves around and is always chatting away. so, it's mufiday and look over at my friend who was leaning over a desk with his ass sticking out, while he was talking to another student. 

so i go up and with a huge wind up, slap his ass so hard that he immediately jumps up, as if he's just jumped out of his own skin. 

you see, the problem with that was that the person i slapped was not actually my friend... but our teacher. 

everyone is at a stand still, waiting for my death penelty, especially my friend whose just staring my down at this point. now the teacher's face goes bright red, and i'm starting to freak out thinking i'm doomed.

"by giving an alternative meaning to a (previously) suicidal girl's tattoo.. disclaimer: this actually happened several years ago, but i do still feel really bad.

i was out on a date with a girl and things were going well despite me being a nervous wreck. we got to talking and she admitted she had depression and at one point was even suicidal, but was proud of herself for getting past that chapter of her life. she then shows me her semi-colon tattoo on her wrist and explains the significance - that it means the sentence could have ended there, but the author decided to add more. it's all very sweet and heartfelt. now, i in no way have any issues with mental illness and still feel super guilty about this to this day, but me with a perpetual foot-in-the-mouth syndrome say ""you know in programming it means end"".

"by not openning a gift for 1.5 years. this actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. i was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. we got on well and i was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country i decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. i thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so i kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

in the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. it was all a blur but i kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what i think. well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided not to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). we met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but i was prepared and considered that was it.

the box stayed in my fridge for i dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? she went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and i also met somebody else. one day i was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously i still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then i saw a full page note from her. she basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

i just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. i probably looked like an asshole for how i acted when i last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am i..

"by changing a client's desktop background to sexy pikachu. this just happened 2 hours ago.


i work for an it company that services many small/medium businesses. i'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. we like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


i had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his pc unlocked. i sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. i quickly pulled up ie and googled ""sexy pikachu"". found the one(http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. then i went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. standard stuff.


i quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. he notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. then he says, ""hey, i'm remoted into a client's computer. you changed their background, not mine.""


i shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""hey, i have jane doe on the phone. she says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" jane doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. i also believe she's the owner's daughter. at first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. he's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


i stand there for a good 30 seconds before i say ""ok, send her over to me."" i'm a director and i have a working relationship with jane doe, so it's really best i talk to her.


i answer the phone. i listen to what she has to say. she had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. she attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new pc and she wants to know what's going on. i tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. i apologize for it, i tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. i hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  i've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""hey, i'm locking my computer for you"" or ""hey, i'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""

"by jerking off and forgetting my petcam was faced directly at me. so i want to just say this is 100% true and 100% embarrassing. 


so i usually have monday's off and spend the day doing homework, tidying up, playing video games, and today... jerking off. i don't usually feel inclined to do this however today i had the urge. it was about an hour before my girlfriend got home so i definitely had time. i go into my room and get into bed and start skimming thru ol' faithful aka pornhub. 

i finally find a video worth b'ing my l to and get down to business. as i'm about to... ya know... i get an alert on my phone that my girlfriend had just accessed the petcam we have in our room that's on our dresser. (we got this petcube camera for christmas so we can watch our two dogs while we are at work/school/out.) i immediately stop, now knowing that my girlfriend just witnessed me jerking it mid-monday so i text her ""........"" . she doesn't answer for about 2 minutes and then i see that she's calling me. 

now we've been together 2.5 years so this isn't like a make or break thing and i honestly thought that although it was slightly embarrassing, it was also pretty funny. so i answer the phone laughing, ready for this to be something we joke about for a long time to come. unfortunately, i was sadly mistaken to this being ""funny"". she tells me that her co-workers had asked about our dogs and she wanted to show them on our awesome petcam! but instead of two cute dogs on our bed, it was just me with my shorts down at my ankles, going to town on myself! so needless to say i don't think i'll be invited to any of her work christmas parties in the future.

tl;dr : decided to crank it before my girlfriend got home and forgot my petcam was faced directly at me. she wanted to show her co-workers our dogs and instead showed them me jerking it in our bed.

edit: lmao just some clarification... she's shown coworkers before because they love our dogs and ask to see them because it's ""cute"" to see them live and sleeping. also, in her defense, i told her i was doing homework and what not so the last thing to cross her mind was me yankin it probably. also the cam is tucked in the corner so i forget it's even there most the time. (b'ing my l = blowing my load)

edit 2 (last one) : for everyone saying ""why would you have a petcam facing your bed?"" that's where our dogs are 90% of the time. when we are out of the house, that's where we leave them. when we are home, that's mostly where they want to be unless we're on the couch with them. don't you think we put the camera there..... for a reason? lol and btw, my gf and i are fine! she was freaked out about it at first but now it's already funny. that's why i love her so much lol so take it easy on her, we both fucked up!

"by walking in on my teenaged son masterbating.. this just happened and i am still wishing it didn't.   my  15 year old son and i are home, i'm working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing fortnite.   he disappears for a little while and i go to find him.    i didn't really need him for anything, just wanted to say 'hi' since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.

i start walking down the hallway towards his room—our house isn't super big and i knew he was in there.   the lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but i could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.

i decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   he was lying with his back to me, i could tell by where his phone was.   as i am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, i see it.   my son's boner.   as i was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   it all happened so fast and i was already airborne before i realized what was happening.   i did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son's boner through his boxer briefs.   

the entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, i'm sure.   i have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, and i don't want to.

at that point, i am still flopped down on his bed.   both of us are well aware that i just saw him whacking off.    both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   i say, 'dinner is almost ready.'   (it wasn't)
he said, 'ok, i'll be out in a minute.'
i said, 'no hurry.'

now i'm standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he'll need if he ever finds out i posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering why don't boys close the door when they are masturbating?  

tl/dr:   basically the title.     

edit: spelling.   dammit, i can't change the spelling of 'masturbating' in the title.   oh well.   i fixed 'fortnite' though.   

edit 2:  for those asking:

—i am mom.
—i want to be clear, i have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   i am a nurse.   i talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   the horrifying part is that i walked in on him.   that was not ideal.  for either one of us.  
—his door was open.  
—i have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before i walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   
—he isn't on any social media.   i am quite confident that his identity is protected.

edit 3:   for anyone still interested...

thank you (almost) everyone for taking this as it was:  an embarrassing moment which has most definitely taught both my son and i lessons about boundaries and privacy.    

wow.   i now know what 'rip my inbox' feels like.   i had no idea reddit would be so into my awkward moment.

for those who sent creepy shit to my inbox, just no.

now, i was going quite fast and as i said, did not have a seat belt on. next thing i knew i was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. no pain, no panic, nothing. i just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush i've ever had in my life. i just laid there, not knowing what to do. i heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. i thought i was going to die. there was a lot of blood.

you know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? well that didn't quite happen but i did start thinking about who i care about and who i love. here's where i tell you about my best friend. a girl i've been in love with for around two years, i never let her know and never intended too. she is in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and i didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy i'm happy. there's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. but i thought i was literally dying, and all i could think about was her in those moments. the pain was starting to kick in but i was just thinking about how she'd never know how much i loved her.

i realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force i could muster i took it out. it was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message i could sent was an ""i love you"" to her. i thought that would be the last message i'd ever send.

i don't remember much after that. days have been a blur. i've had quite a few operations, aki due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. but my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like i got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! all i do is sleep and appreciate the fact i'm alive. the other driver and the kid were okay btw.
anyway, as you can see, i did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but i can't undo that message i sent. i've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. i told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. i haven't replied yet and i don't want to. i don't know what to do. so far i've been writing this as procrastination and then after this i plan on taking a long nap. thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.



tldr: got in a car accident and while i was bleeding out i told my crush best friend i love her. she's in a 10 year relationship and i haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me.



edit: god guys this blew up so much!!! i only wrote this to procrastinate the inevitable conversation you guys are amazing jeez thanks for all the advice and support!!

so i spoke to her... over the phone because we're college friends and she lives far away right now. i decided that the best thing i could do at this point was just tell her the truth. i didn't expect anything and i didn't want anything to come out of it, but i just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn't be legitimate. i would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but i guess life is just different from movies...

i told her how i felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. but i also added, and it's true, that i've gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he's great. i don't want to hurt him or interfere as much as i want her happy. i think she understood where i came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. i hope nothing will change with her because i love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. so i guess i just have to give you the boring response... but it's reality so sorry if it sucks... im okay with though, i really didn't expect anything and still kind of think i was being selfish. we talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! she said she'll try and make the trip, even though i told her not to because it's gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... she was really flattered though i think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing i thought about when i thought i was going to die",4
"by letting my cat put his head in my mouth.. throwaway account for obvious reasons. this just happened a few minutes ago. i was laying on my couch and my cat decided to jump up and lay on my chest as he often does. i had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. he was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. i was feeling pretty generous at that time so i got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because i was curious how far he would venture in. you know, normal pet owner stuff. he got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. i'm fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. 

tl;dr: my cat sneezed directly in my mouth.",4
"by plagiarizing from my own reddit post and getting threatened to be dropped from my university. ***background***

i am a very passionate writer. i *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. every week i would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  

***story time***

last year, on r/writingprompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. i forget the full details, but it intrigued me and i wrote a 6-page story about it. anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but i still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that reddit post.

**^((it was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**

***present*** 

so a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. so i was like, okay sweet i don't need to spend any time on this project. i went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. to be sure i don't get into any trouble, i delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. 

yesterday, i get an email from the professor saying i need to meet with the dean immediately. at this point, i am shitting my pants. she told me that i stole someone else's work and i could be withdrawn from my program. i try to explain but i have no proof that it was my work because i no longer live at home and i wrote it on an old laptop. i have a meeting with the head of the university later today. i am so fucking scared. i am currently driving home to find that fucker.  

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i copied and pasted my own work from my own reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. could be withdrawn from my program


edit 1: 17:00 i found my original work. took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. i'm okay with taking a zero, obviously, i just hope they can reason. 

also, i can't show the reddit emails because i never had a real email for the account. 

edit 2: success! i brought my old laptop to the university principal and provided proof that i was the one to write the story. they were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what i told them before. they asked me why i did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. i told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. 

*results*

i am not kicked out, and i am actually given another chance at the project. my professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. 


thanks everyone who supported me through this! i won't do this again. i'm sorry. 


also, thanks u/squid_fucker for the suggestion

> just read all the edits.  you know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  if the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.


maybe this will be the plot of the new story. ",4
"by saying the worst possible thing in a restaurant. this happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in austria.

being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly austrian and german people passing our table. we've been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

i was joking with the kids  that i'd left their nintendo switch at home, they suspected i was joking but went along with it anyway. so when i told them i had brought it they wanted to check.

""i brought it,"" i said 

""our switch?""

""yes, our switch""

""what?!! our switch?!""

""yes!! our switch!!""

they got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. i noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn't really register.

""our switch?""

""our switch! ha!""

then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - i was like ""it's ok... it's a buffet""

""our switch! ha!""

""our switch!""

then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered ""it sounds like you are all shouting auschwitz""

my whole body went cold with the realisation.

needless to say i immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son's knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before i could stop him... 

i have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

tldr: shouted ""auschwitz"" loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of germans and austrians. i'm really sorry.

edit: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! my first. to those calling bs: i wish it was. to the genial germans and austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - i will sleep better tonight because of you. and for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it's a kinderhotel. kind of like if michael bay did buffets.

edit2: just to all my salty comrades telling me i'm a ""scum cunt"", that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. i fucking love you reddit! i'm reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. you wouldn't like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. it's like a school playground where they've all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn't walking past our table..",4
"by teaching my 4 year old about static electricity. so it was rather cold today and i put some nice, thick wool socks on my 4 year old son.  after running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... zaaap.  

i explained to him that he's got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a ""shock"".  my son looks at me and says ""like pikachu?""

a bit of background.  a few months ago i discovered that disney now has the full run of all pokemon episodes.  like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  my son and i have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  my wife and i decided to get a switch as a family gift for christmas, along with let's go pikachu.  for my son's birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  

so a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his pikachu plushie.  drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing frostpunk and says ""donder shok!!"" while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  

as he runs away, clutching his plushie, all i can say to my wife was ""i think pikachu's been teaching him some tricks"".  she was not amused.  



tl;dr - pikachu taught my son thunder shock.  my wife is not happy about this development.  


edit:  my first gold!  thank you kind stranger!

edit 2:  i know this may be more cute than traditionally tifu, but i'm rather singed at the moment and the wife wasn't too pleased at the time.   i know she'll be laughing about it in a day or two with the rest of us (i hope).

"by almost murdering my friend and stopping a school-wide arms race.. so this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. and just before sillybands took over as chief tween pimp currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed ""locker artillery"". basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. we would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and paper hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.

eventually, things got out of hand. it became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. heists were performed on teacher's desks. books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. students presented welts from paper hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. rubber bands were contraband. it was a full-on mad max magic school bus adventure.

here's where the fuckup started. one night, i was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: the secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. i needed something aerodynamic. so, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. ""i'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?"" i thought to myself.

let me tell you.

the next day, i created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. with the inkwell loaded, i felt like a small, sexually frustrated macgyver with intent to kill. on the bus, my friend (let's call him neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. i obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). i aimed, pulled back and fired. all i saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before i heard an extremely sudden *crack*. i looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from neo's head.

my parents had to pay for the window. neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until senior year. the principal cracked down on locker artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. 

but i still won that arms race.

tl;dr: sixth grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. i upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. i was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.

edit: rip inbox. thank you for the gold, kind stranger!

"by catcalling my husband.. edited to add: holy crap, this post blew up more than i expected! thank you to the anonymous redditors that gave me my first silver and platinum, you are so awesome!

naturally, this did not happen today...
tl;dr is at the bottom.

about a week ago, i was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. we had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. so we picked up lunch and took it to my husband's work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.

we got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). our kids loved it!

as we were leaving, i saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out ""hey, nice butt babe!""

then it happened, my 3 year old yelled ""nice butt daddy!"" which quickly turned into ""nice butt mama.""

i tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. i thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.

i was wrong.

now, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;

""nice butt papa"" (what he calls our elderly neighbor)

""nice butt mama""

""nice butt baby"" (his little brother)

i don't think we will be leaving the house today...

tl;dr i set a bad example for my child and now he is telling everyone that they have a nice butt.",4
"tifu by accidentally proposing to my gf of 2 months. so this just happened. back story i had a gf of 6 years i was going to propose to, and as not necessarily superstitious i will not ""recycle"" an engagment ring even tho it cost what it did. i thought it was stolen or lost. it had been missing for close to 3 years. 

so what happened. in the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. simple enough i thought. 

now with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. this is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. 

seemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.

and thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way oh my god no fucking way. at this point im like wtf was that about. when i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.

light bulb she thought i was proposing to her ( in what may be one of the strangest ways possible) but never the less she saw a ring being held out to her and freaked the fuck out. 

hour latter trying to explain i wasent and it was a lost ring i had literally just found she and i are laughing our asses off.

good to know it wasent a flat out no!


tl;dr found a lost ring had bad timing gf thought i was propossing heart fell to floor hilarity insued.

"by unintentionally giving my friend a masturbation alert. so after five months of doing this shit i realized today that this has been happening.

before this happened i was unaware incognito mode on chrome was a thing. because of this every time i would go to a certain nsfw website i would type the link into a discord (basically the new skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. i only send the links to him while it said he is offline. i did this so my chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website i decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. i would then click on the link of the website through discord and delete the message. little did i know that my friend has discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. he basically had an alert for every time i masturbated.

so after i had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these nsfw links in the middle of the day. i start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. i told him about the whole process i go through just to get to a website. after that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. after more laughing we moved on.  

i'm glad to know about incognito mode though i will probably keep doing it has i have been because i'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   


tl;dr: i have been sending nsfw links to my friend on discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search. he has discord notifications enabled on his phone therefore giving him an alert every time i masturbate .",4
"by holding my breath and passing out during a lecture.. this happened earlier today. so i was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that i couldn't care less about what my professor was talking about. so i decided to start holding my breath. now, this is something i normally do if i get really bored. i'll hold my breath for as long as i can and then i'll rest for 3 minutes. i'll do 5 sets of that. i also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. i've actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. anyways, i start holding my breath and i'm feeling particularly good and i start thinking i can break my record today. i got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then i decide to drop out. ""i can do better, let's go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds"". so i go and i'm feeling super confident about it. i get to 2 minutes 20 sec and i'm feeling a little light headed. get to 2 min and 30 seconds and i'm struggling. like i'm thrashing around silently in my chair, but i'm going for gold. get to 2 minutes 40 and i'm seriously hurting. things are getting bad. i close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (it also made the seconds go faster) all of a sudden i open my eyes and i'm looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. as i learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. i spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that i was fine. lecture finally resumed and i just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache. lecture still sucked after that. 

tl;dr tried going for olympic gold in breath holding. failed and ended up spread eagle in our lecture hall.

"by becoming an accidental active school shooter. this happened in the oughties. tl/dr below.

my (relatively small) hs held an unexpected live active shooter drill.  it was the first time they had ever done this. i don't know who developed this genius procedure. it actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

we had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. the teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... the trauma would help us react better? no idea. in fact, i remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.

however, it so happened that i was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. my teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. now i understand why. (his mistake, but i played my part soon after)

on my way to the office (i was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. i was truly in a wtf state.

here's where i f-up. now i am the only dummy walking the hallways. given the layout of this building, when i tell you it was dark, i mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. and it was completely silent now. it all happened in a matter of seconds. i can't say i was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. still, given my aversion to our principal since i was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, i just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. i assumed my teacher knew what was happening and i didn't want to be in more trouble so i just yelled

**""hey let me in!!""**

the entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. this coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as i recall.  (again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and i'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice i had heard in my life said

**""get on the ground!!!""**

there was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! so whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought i somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, i don't know. he did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. he grabbed me up and took me to the office.

the rest was a huge blur but essentially i was not punished for that, but i got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. there was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

&#x200b;

tl/dr: became unaccounted for just as an active school shooter drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people.

"by ruining a happy family.. like all good tifus, this didn't happen yesterday.

my wife and i went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  it's just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

one of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  from our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  i assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

on this particular evening, my wife and i were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  i thought it would be fun to pull up youtube and make duck noises.  i found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so i started playing it.  lo and behold, the ducks responded.  at first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  they ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  it was a pretty fun experience.  that is, until it got out of hand.

apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  this other drake had no interest in me, however.  he immediately went for the hen.  this led to a fight between the two drakes.  they started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

my wife and i stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  she still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and i suppose that's fair.

i'm not really super torn up about it.  in fact, i find the whole situation kind of amusing.  i thought this more light-hearted belonged here.

tl;dr:  went to dinner and played duck calls.  called in another drake and ruined a family.

"by quoting thanos while arguing with my gf. trowaway account for privacy, this happened yesterday and i don't know how to make it up.

my girlfriend and i met at university 4 years ago, and we both graduated some time ago. since then we've both been looking for work, but the research is more difficult than we thought, and until yesterday neither of us had managed to get a job. yesterday my girlfriend received a positive answer to one of her applications, for a job located 430 kilometers from our hometown. she was very happy and that's how she told me to come to her house to tell me some good news about the research. so expecting some good news, i took a detour to buy her sushi because we both love it, and i arrived at her house early in the evening, and that's when she tells me that in two weeks she's going to go more than 400 kilometers from our city, and that i now have to look in the same area as her. i totally lost my mind when she told me that. i explain that i understand that the research is complicated, but that it was no reason to look at work across the country, and that i had no desire to leave my family and friends because my life is in my hometown. the situation then became very tense, she told me that i am selfish and that i have to learn to move away, that even if there is no urgency, it is important to find a job quickly so as not to remain inactive. i then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because i really don't want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city. and that, guys, she took it really hard, i've never seen her so upset in my life. she then gave me an ultimatum: either i follow her or we stop our relationship, and she asks me if i'm really ready to leave her to stay with my family and friends. maybe some people can see it, but this is the moment i fucked up.

i still don't know why my brain betrayed me like that, but the only answer i could find was : ""perhaps, maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"". i could have made long rants to show her that i love her, that i care about her. i could have found arguments so that we could solve the situation, as any person in a relationship for 4 years would do. but no, my fucking stupidity made me quote a purple guy. she looked at me with an empty look for several seconds, i realized how much i fucked up, but nothing came from my mouth. she just asks me to leave her house, and since yesterday she speak to me or answer my calls and messages. i sent her a very long message of apology, adding that i hope we will be able to resolve the situation, but still no answer.

i am now staring my thanos funko pop thinking how much this guy may have ruined part of my life.

&#x200b;

edit : whoah, this blew up far more than i could imagine. i took time to read all your comments, and i spend a big part of my day speaking with my gf about the situation. so here's the situation : 1) she's mad that in such a situation my only answer was quoting a meme, 2) she thinks (and she's not the only one from what i read) that i'm still a child for wanting to stay in my city.

to clarify some things i'm living in a small country in europe, that's why 400km is basically across the country. then i admit it, i may not be ready to start my professional life. in my head i'm still a student who always wants to enjoy his life like it was : going out with friends, enjoying parties in the middle of the week, watching sports and taking care of my gf. for me, the best to start my work life was to find a job in my city to keep my bearings and my way of life and to be able to gradually switch to something more serious. that's a big part of why a freaked out when she told me to come far away from everything that defines my life. also yes, there was a big lack of communication in my relationship, she's the first to admit it and apologizes for it.

today we had a more serious discussion (no meme quotes guys !) where both of us expressed their point of view. for my gf, this work is not her dream work, but she wants to take it because we can't find nothing here and she just wants to take it in order to gain experience, and then quit it to a better opportunity. she told me that it would only be a matters of months. i explained my feelings and what i wanted to start my life, and to my surprise she understood. we even reached an agreement : i will looking for a job in my city and in the city where she will work, and i will take the first opportunity. she also needs me to be with here the first month to help her settle in and not to stress about her new situation.  now that we've explained and reached a compromise, she's much calmer and ready to go on, so it seems my stupidity and the purple guy may have not ruined something.

oh, i saw some people were wondering : when i left her house yesterday, i didn't take back the sushi

&#x200b;

tldr : gf finds a job far away from our city and i doesn't want to leave my life to live this far. she asks me if i'm really ready to leave her just to stay in my city and my only answer was ""maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"".",4
"by knocking out the guy i'm seeing. this actually happened yesterday but i couldn't get a chance to post it.  

i'm a pretty ""basic"" white girl. i'm 21, i like starbucks, i wear leather leggings and hoodies, i'm blonde, i have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy i'm sorta dating didn't believe me when i told him i've been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. it kinda pissed me off he thought i'm making it up to look cool in front of him because he's been trying to get into kickboxing-- so i figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he's been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  

he kinda laughed at the idea but i made him accept.  

we got to the gym, i met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. the dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he'd go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn't hurt and it'd be fun. there was no way i'm saying no to that. my plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that i've really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn't put on any protective gear. i got mad.  

we begin. he's laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like i'm some kid-- and i'm just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. the cheering was the boiling point. as soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere i decided to head kick him with everything i had. i literally grunted as i kicked him. in the ten or so years i've been kickboxing i don't think i've ever kicked anyone that hard. he was out cold before he even hit the ground. 

needless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that i've actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- i also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the ko.  

surprisingly, he doesn't hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. 

tl;dr: my date didn't believe me i've been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. i head kicked him and knocked him out cold.

edit; this kinda blew up and i can't reply to everyone! i know what i did is fucked up and bad and i realize how bad it'd look if the genders were reversed. i didn't post this to gloat and brag nor do i think he had it coming-- i thought this sub is about fuck ups- this was a fuck up on my part. i didn't realize this would offend so many people.

edit 2; guys, i can't stress this enough- i posted this because i fucked up. he's fine and his coach took him to the hospital. i'm really sorry if this came out as me bragging, it's on me for writing it up like this. i hope someone reads the edits because i can't reply to every individual comment.",4
"by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years.. this did happen today. my grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. she doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. one of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. she says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. so she keeps changing the position of my bed when i am away for work. when i come back, i reposition it my way so that i don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
today, she was repositioning the room while i was there which annoyed me. so i took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that i was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. infact i was pointing east . i instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. and she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. i pointed it out to her. i thought she would take it lightly. oh man i was wrong. i fucked up biig time. she lost herself. she started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. i am looking at her old compass right now and i can say it doesn't seem right at all. i think i will have to fix this issue today itself. she is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. how stupid am i. 

tl;dr : i fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. she did not take it well . 

edit 1: a lot of you are asking me how she moves furniture at the age of 90. well she doesnt do it herself, she has a helper who is supposed to take care of her personally but my grandmother doesn't like the idea of employing someone particularly for her so she gives her household chores to keep her busy.
edit 2: yes the caregiver gets paid extra for this. we tell her not to do the chores  and i assure you it's not that regular. ",4
"by accidentally doing my black history month project on a white guy. in 5th grade, i had a black history month project where i had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. i looked up 'important african americans' and found a wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so i thought. i chose allan mcleod cormack, a south-african american scientist, seeing that he invented the ct scan. i put my blood sweat and tears into that project. two days before the project was due i decided to put a picture of cormack on my poster. to my confusion, all i could find was a picture of this white guy. turns out, he was a white south african. i made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. she let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but i had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month. 

tl;dr i did my black history project on a white guy and didn't realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.

edit: though cormack was born in south africa, he became a us citizen early in his career. that's why he was on the list of african americans.",4
"by not realizing cheese isn't supposed to hurt you. i guess this is three decades in the making but i only discovered it saturday, so it feels like a very fresh fu.

this weekend i was eating a sandwich with some extra sharp parmigiano-reggiano cheese flakes on it and i made the comment over voice chat with my friends that it was so good but so sharp it was tearing up my mouth. i had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.

""you know, it's extra sharp. it really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.""

and that's when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. i hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that i have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that i've had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that i always assumed *everyone* had it. 

""what the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if that's not what you're talking about?!""

i figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods. i love spicy foods. i love sharp cheeses. i thought they were the same kind of thing where they were supposed to hurt you a little bit. apparently ""sharp"" just means ""flavorful"" or ""tangy.""

tl;dr: i have an allergy to some cheese protein and for 30 years i've been thinking that sharp cheese is supposed to sting.",4
"by breathing with one nostril my whole life.. so let me give some context on how this happened, a while ago i tried out an e-cig my friend has and he made fun of how smoke only goes out of one of my nostrils,i didn't think much of it , i thought its just a stuffed nose.

so i try to clean my nose and its already not stuffed but yet again i didn't put much thought into it.
yesterday i noticed that my right nostril is blocked again and my nose isn't stuffed, so i go look in the mirror to see that my right nostril is completely blocked by my septum.

i took a doctor appointment the next morning and as soon as he looked in he said i have septum deviation caused by breaking my nose at some point in my life when i was a kid and that it needed surgery.
i cant believe i've went for god knows how many years without realizing i wasn't breathing correctly and thinking that this was the norm.
surgery is within 24hours so yeah, this escalated quickly.

tl;dr. i'm stupid and didn't realize my right nostril was blocked off by my septum for years.",4
"by fucking my dads couch. throwaway, because i don't want to become a notorious couch fucker on reddit.

this happened last week on saturday, because saturday and sunday is my father's custody time for me. saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got ""called into work"" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.

this made me think about all the possible (private) things i could do to anything around the house. then i saw; **the $700 leather couch**. i executed my plan. 
materials needed: dish soap, a couch, and rags

i started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. then, i put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. then, the couch bestiality commenced. lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin i am, and there was no turning back. 

another detail about my dad getting called into work is that i was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. on a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. 

not today

he left at 9:30 am for work, and i was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which i felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. then it **happened**. the couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight

here(https://imgur.com/wi2nz1q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.

i heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. the knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. he gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words ""what the fuck are you doing"". i couldn't decide what to do, so i just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags i stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly ""sorry^sorry^sorry"". he walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."". the rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.

tl;dr: fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected 

edit: typo

edit no.2: holy shit yall blew this up.
i really, really, really appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not. my couch fucking earned me a dollar and i'm proud!",4
"by accidentally asking a married woman for nudes. obligatory ""this happened a couple weeks ago""

so me (21m) and my best friend (22m) have been best friends since high school. we're from the same town, and went to high school together, but ended up going to different colleges. anyways, i'm super close with his entire family to the point of when summers come around, i end up spending entire days over at his house, sometimes when no one's there. his family counts me as part of their own family.

so his sister (24f) posted a story on instagram about her texting her boyfriend (23m) asking for help with a word puzzle. it was one of those ""even when i'm sick and can't hang out, i still need help with word puzzles"" things. classic couple. well i take it on myself to figure out the puzzle. so i swipe up and i'm thinking of what it could be, when i realize the letters could spell out ""nudes."" eventually, i send it off as ""nudes? lol"" and put my phone away, thinking she'll realize what i mean and maybe she'll also be glad for the help.

a few minutes later, i get a message from an old coworker of mine (26f) that says ""oh my!!"" i think to myself, ""well that's weird, i haven't talked to her in forever"" so i open up instagram. turns out, while i had been sitting and trying to figure out the puzzle, instagram had cycled through to the next person's story, which belonged to my former coworker who just so happened to have posted a picture of her 3yo son. my heart immediately sunk. i realized my mistake, and went straight into panic mode, showing screenshots of my best friend's sister's story and the like. she said she understood, but at the very best she figures that i was asking someone else for nudes and made up an elaborate story to cover up.

tl;dr was trying to help a friend with a puzzle on instagram and thought the answer was ""nudes"" so i accidentally sent ""nudes? lol"" to a former coworker who had posted a picture of her 3yo son.

"by realizing my history teachers gave me a horribly skewed version of what happened leading up to the civil war.. i had 4 years of rotc in high school and 2 semesters of american history. (2 separate teachers) so, not a history major, but i have absorbed a lot of material on the civil war. and i realized today that it was horseshit and i got hoodwinked.

before that, like most people, when someone asked me why the civil war happened, my answer would have been ""slavery"". and that definitely was an issue. but my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. they gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the north, what europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --there was a lot. and it made sense, because i found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. so they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. again, super plausible. this was all being presented with an attitude of ""now let me tell you what really happened"". 

im six semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the declarations of secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. i had no idea they existed. i read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. they were all about slavery and how it was ""the greatest institution ever conceived"" and that it had to be protected. there's no way this wasn't the forefront issue, after reading those papers. i messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, i wasn't. i told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the secession declarations either. ugh.

reddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong i was. i don't care about people calling me dumb, i'll own that. i just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and i got this...propaganda. i am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. i hope my stupidity is isolated, but i wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? 

tl;dr i thought the civil war was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.

edit: the fu part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the reddit community about how completely stupid i was for me to learn about the documents, or the cornerstone speech. which i guess is fair, i dunno. it hurt my feelings, but it shook loose the truth for me.

"by accidentally committing theft as a police officer in full uniform.. poilce don't seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. this happened a few weeks ago.

i woke up one morning at 5:00 a.m. tired as fuck. i put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on tv or in a video game.

i started my normal routine: got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best ""prepare for a police shift"" album of all time: ""the elder scrolls v: skyrim ost"". now for my 15 minute commute to the city.

my vehicle was getting low on gas so i stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. i went in, put my sausage, egg, and cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. then i grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like i do as the beginning of every shift. after this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.

at about noon, i get a call from my sergeant, who simply said ""i need to talk to you at the department.""

oblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, i began heading to the police department. millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. upon my arrival, i was directed to my lieutenant's office. when i walked in, i heard a stern, ""close the door"". at this point i knew this wasn't good. i sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my corporal. sergeant, and lieutenant.

after a preface from my sergeant, he says, ""tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.

i didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. ""aaawww.......shit. i forgot to pay for my burrito."" then i just heard ""guess what, that's theft.""

after a ""come to jesus"" moment with my superiors, i left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. they didn't want to press charges.

although nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is i can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. all they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. 

on a lighter tone, now other officers have nicknamed me ""the burrito burglar"" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when i see them.

tl;dr: i'm a police officer. walked into a gas station i go into every morning and, being in ""autopilot"" mode, i walked out with the same burrito i get every morning, and forgot to pay for it.",4
"by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store.... this happened earlier today and i'm pretty sure i'm on a police watch list now.

needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store i was running low on that i like to have around. zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

while i was there i noticed they were having a store wide sale. i'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up i like to keep certain back up items in my truck if i need them. i figured i would grab some things while they are on sale.

walking through the isles i start randomly grabbing items i think i might need for my kit. such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

keep in mind i already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when i walk up to the register. these are things i generally purchase, buy never all at once.

girl at the register greets me as i start placing items on the counter. i give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

about half way through she slows down a bit. she looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. i'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

her: ""wow that's a big knife.""
me: ""yeah i like having cheap, throwaway knives around. same with tarps and stuff too.""
stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

her: ""can i see your id to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as i've never been asked for my id here. pull it out and hand it to her. 

she quickly looks at my id info and then glances up at her screen where i noticed my reward info was pulled up. didn't think anything of it at the time.

she says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. almost looking like she was taking inventory of what i had.

she gives me my total and i hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

i get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. she yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. i grab it as i notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
i say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

i get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. she glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

i was like what? still clueless. before she points out that it looks like i'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

girl at register must have thought the same thing. checked my info and i'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

tl;dr: 
bought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. pretty sure cashier thought i was a serial killer.",4
"by blowing my load absolutely everywhere during a massage. so this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.

i visited thailand in september '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. this meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and i never felt ok jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so i decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. i was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.

one morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on koh samui, i decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. after a little splash around i used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, i didn't think much of it. i then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious pad thai.

i suffer from ongoing back pains, so when i hit thailand i took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. now, considering how vulgar my username is, i am actually bit of a prude. i didn't want any ""rug and tug"" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once i start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? not that i'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. so, after being a little drunk and full of food i decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.

this wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. i went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. i asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought i was after anything ""extra"") and got ready. it was only when i started taking my sweatpants off that i remembered that i was free-balling, i explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst i awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.

the first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones i'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (i'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), i was in absolute bliss. then came the time for the front. look, by this point i had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had ""awoken the beast"" to some level or another. with this massage i was at absolute full-mast. one of those ""i've not jerked off in three weeks"", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. i apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. she laughed and started working on my legs, i started relaxing a bit more, i imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. she went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch i imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. i went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.

cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that i thought i'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but i also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. all the while i'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. mostly despair. after a short while, the fireworks were over. there was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. i realised that i'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. wordlessly i put my clothes on, not making eye contact, i pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. i often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.

edit - typos  


edit 2 - after desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as i could, i received a notification that i'd hit the front page. so, i guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, i still need to work too. in all honesty, i wrote up this event because i had been told i had to during one of the many times i have regaled people with it. i had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so i posted it typos and all. i did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and i am grateful beyond words. every little complement and giggle is doing more good than i think most people would realise. thank you.

"by losing a butt plug nsfw. this happened about 20 min ago.

so last night my girlfriend and i decided to go out to the bars. got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. well last night was the first time we decided to use them. we read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. everything went well but afterwards we couldn't find the plug. this is where the begins. 

we figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. gfs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she's a little extra hungover no big deal. we arrive at mcds to get some greasy hangover food. i order while gf heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. as i take our order back to our table, gf walks over in a panic saying we need to leave now.

she found the butt plug. in our drunken state, we managed to put the entire thing in her ass. handle and all. and now it's sitting at the bottom of a mcdonalds toilet in all its glory.

"by suggesting twin peaks as a joke for the location of a company meeting.. about two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.

as a joke i wrote in twin peaks as one of the suggestions.

i am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. the trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a huge margin.

i am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most rsvp's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.

the day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. in the entire process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. the organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. the waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.

about an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. by then it was too late. the money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.

i have to hand it to upper management. they powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. although he did start the meeting with. ""i was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but i think i know why so many of you joined us today."" this drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.

other than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.

it took all of 3 hours after the meeting for it to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.

i was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.

i came in this morning and was informed i am to receive a write up for this. they are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. they understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at twin peaks.

tl:dr suggested twin peaks as a joke location for meeting. bosses did not research twin peaks at all and we had a quarterly meeting at the location. i got written up for it. ",4
"by cripwalking out of my maths class. no, isn't a joke. this happened less than 2 hours ago.

so you might be wondering, how in the fuck did i manage to cripwalk out of my maths class? why on earth would i do it? well, let me tell you. here i am, chilling in class, while we're doing simple quadratic equations, and one of our classmates could not even comprehend how to solve it. my teacher, of course, gets pissed, and then she catches a student chatting, which led her to losing her shit. she starts saying how we all copy our answers when doing work, and tells us that if we don't enjoy the class, we can exit the room, pointing to the open door.

i sat there hesitating for about a few seconds, thinking ""should i? nahh"" and then thought: it's the end of the year, nothing will happen and everyone would get a good laugh out of this! maybe. but not the teacher.

so i get up, put my books in my bag while everyone is giving me confused looks (including the teacher), and i shit you not, i cripwalk out the door, closing the door on the way out. as soon as i'm outside the classroom, the whole class is fucking howling, literally screaming, you could even hear it from the first floor.

i'm feeling all slick and shit thinking ""that was definitely worth it"", but then it fucking dawns on me. **the parent-teacher conference is today, in less than 3 hours. and i have to go to it too.**

&#x200b;

*yeah, i'm fucked. please pray for me*

&#x200b;

**tl:dr** \- i tried to be funny by cripwalking out of my maths class when my teacher offered us to leave the classroom and the parent-teacher conference starts in less than 3 hours now. rip me

edit: i'll add an update if i'm alive by the time i get back home from the conference

edit2: thank you for the gold, i didn't think this would blow up so much lmao

edit3: i am alive and well. still cripwalking on the haters. mom did not kill me, i repeat, mom did not kill me. i will post a tifupdate soon.

"tifu by getting a facial. this happened about two hours ago.

i've been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. he flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. he even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. i really wanted to show him how i much i appreciated all his gestures, so i thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. i start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. he gives me the signal and i activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view i can. that's where the fuck up occurs. i tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. it took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time i figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. at this point, i just sit there and take it up the nose because i'll be damed if i let man gravy get on anything. i immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but i didn't get it all. not long after, i feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. i still have the smell of semen in my nose. 

tldr: a dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.

edit: holy fuck, i did not expect this to blow up like it did. thank you to whoever gave me my first silver!

"by ruining a movie shoot with jennifer aniston. disclaimer: this should be, ""several years ago ifu,"" but i'm a reddit n00b and wanted to share one of the most awkward series of events i've ever caused.

i had plans to meet up with some friends in atlantic city for the weekend. i got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the taj mahal. i had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.

i parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. on my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. he let a bunch of people in and, of course, i squeezed through as he was closing it off.

that is where things went sideways. i saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, ""huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if i'll be in it?"" but before i could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. a second later, someone yells, ""action!""

i start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, ""i'm not suposed to be here, am i?"" he immediately shook his head no.

so, i see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. i think to myself, ""if i can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby."" 

i make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. success! i didn't screw anything up!

after a few more steps, i catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. and they're blocking the full width, and not walking! i mean, come on!

only at this point, do i see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. then someone yells ""cut!"", and the two people in front of me turn around. 

turns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were jennnifer aniston and gerard butler, and i completely blew up their scene. there was nothing i could do.. i just said, ""uh, i'm sorry."" i figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.

tl;dr. i somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation.",4
"by telling a girl on a first date that i work with deaf children and know sign language.  

so first of all i'll start off with a little context… i don't usually do formal first dates, especially when its with somebody i barely even know. however, i've just come back to university for my final year of studying and i met up with my old flat mate from last year. she had already moved into her new flat and met all of her new flat mates, one of which happened to be a very attractive girl who we will call stacey. now my old flat mate was always trying to set me up on dates last year at university, but i always had an excuse. now with it being a new year i thought ill have a fresh start and really knuckle down and stop going out all the time (i said exactly the same after my 1st year) and focus on my uni work and look for a serious relationship instead of having flings. 

so i get shown a few pictures of stacey and my old flat mate is telling me how nice she seems and how great she is and honestly i just thought why not, i may as well, what harm could going on a date possibly bring about? so she gives me staceys number and we start to text and chat for a couple of weeks and we seem to be getting along really well. so much so that i suggest we should go for some food one evening to meet in person and get to know one another a little better. now bearing in mind i never ever do this, i usually just speak to girls on nights out when i'm filled to the brim with liquid confidence and i'm usually so drunk that my confidence is through the roof. however i feel myself really starting to like this girl, i've never really been one for texting but our conversation seemed to flow naturally.

so i meet stacey at this very busy restaurant last week, i'm full of nerves but i'm ready for the date. we get sat down and we begin chatting away and things seem to be going really well. im still nervous but after a few pints the nerves start to settle and i get a bit carried away telling my stories and my somewhat crude jokes. at the best of times i'm a very loud person, however, after a few beers i turn into a human fog horn and unbeknownst to me, i'm speaking at a level high enough for the whole room to hear. i know this because all of my friends love to remind me how loud i am when we're on a night out. now here comes the fuck up. 

so being full of my favourite ale and with the nerves starting to settle, i'm growing louder and louder by the minute. so much so that stacey, very politely i must say, lets me know that i need to turn the volume down just a tad (especially when telling my alcohol fuelled jokes). now i'm not an angry person by any means, but i can't begin to count the amount of times i've been told to quieten down when drunk, and for some reason i decided this night was the night where i'd have enough. so instead of apologising like any normal person would, drunk me decided it would be a good idea to try and turn it back on stacey. i don't know what come over me but the only excuse i could muster was ""well i do apologise but, you see, i volunteer working with deaf children so i'm used to having to speak really loudly, i've actually just come from there before our date"". 

now if you knew me you would realise how ridiculous this sounds. once i told my friends and my old flat mate about what i had said they were falling to the floor with laughter. so far it doesn't seem that bad, until stacey says something along the lines of ""wow, i'm really sorry, that is great, you must know sign language then?"". drunk me thinking i'd got one up on her proceeded to nod and claim that i do in fact know sign language, i think i even threw up a few fake hand signs which probably looked more like gang signs to cover my tracks. however, what i didn't expect was for stacey to have a younger deaf brother who would apparently love to meet me as she's never dated a guy before who can do sign language!

honestly my heart sank, she was sat across the table from me signing something to me and god knows what she was saying. i just smiled and nodded and to this day i still don't know what she was saying but my unenthusiastic smile and nod seemed to work. i quickly moved the conversation along and got swiftly off the subject. so now stacey thinks i know sign language and what's even better is that she can't wait for me to meet her younger brother who would be so excited to be able to sign with a guy she's dating!

ive tried youtube videos but all i've managed to pick up on is being able to say vowels and ask someones name. i don't have the balls to tell her and i really don't know what to do. im seeing her again next week and i know i need to tell her the truth, she seems the sort of person who would just laugh it off but she seemed so happy when i told her and she's even suggesting we face time her brother when we're next together so i can have a conversation with him. i just feel like a dick now and i don't want to let her down or upset her younger brother, but i don't think asking him his name over and over is going to cut it. 

tl;dr im a loud idiot when i've had a drink and instead of apologising about being such on a first date with a girl, i tried to cover it up by claiming i work with deaf children and know sign language. turned out she has a younger deaf brother who she now wants me to meet and speak to using sign language. i don't have the first clue about how to sign and i don't have the balls to tell her the truth because i don't want hurt her or her brothers feelings.

edit

wow i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, i've just woke up now and had a chance to read through all of your comments, thank you for the platinum and what not, i just want to clear up a few things i've read. 

thanks for all your concern regarding me possibly be a high functioning douche bag alcoholic. first of all when i say really loud, i'm not a boisterous loud, all attention to my please sort of loud, i just speak really loud when i'm drunk enough for other people to hear, it's because i get overly excited and it was a mix of that and the nerves which made me start talking over excitedly and get carried away with the volume. 
also i've seen a few comments about the lying. i know it wasn't right but that's why i tried to stress i never do anything like this, me and in person first dates just don't mix. my nerves just got the better of me and i'm an anxious person at the best of times, i knew right away that coming clean would have been the best thing to do but i'm so awkward that i just didn't know what to say or do and i just wanted to move on the conversation as quickly as possible. i said it in the first place intending it to be a light hearted joke (clearly i'm not funny), i wasn't actually going to roll with the lie that i work with deaf kids. however the last thing i expected was for her to come back with that and it just completely threw me off. i'm seeing her again next weekend so i'll be sure to update you all on how this turns out, thank you for all the advice and the genuine concern a lot of you have, and especially to all of you who have helped me see the funnier side of this situation.",4
"by using my parents pc.. tl;dr at the bottom.

nsfw

this is still fresh in my mind as i'm typing. i take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. today was just a routine visit. my folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so i visit with dad while driving their garbage to the dump. as we are talking i bring up a video i had seen and suggested i share it with him. he agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests i find the video while he does something else. 

commence fuckup. 
my dad has an older model desktop pc that is quite temperamental and only likes to use google chrome. i go to open a window and see that my dad has 20+ tabs open. all of them were different profiles on fetlife. for those who don't know, fetlife is like myspace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). i just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. unfortunately the tab i opened chrome to was my parents profile page. i not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; i also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. so now, not only do i know my parents are pretty kinky, i also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a christmas turkey. 

tl;dr:
opened google chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular.

edit2: wow my first gold! thanks stranger!!

edit 3: my wife is a reddit user and knows her husband posted this from the commute detail. she didn't believe me so she temporarily created a fetlife account so i could, for once, be right. now she is very distraught and has told me she can never look at my parents the same. what do?",4
"by masturbating too hard which led to having surgery. obligatory this didn't happen today but when i was in the 8th grade.

8th grade was about the first time i discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (whatever year they show the ""birds and the bees"" movie at school) well, needless to say, i was all for it. i think i did it just about everyday after school. and i was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.

one day in particular though, i wanted to see how fast i could do the deed. so after school i ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. i counted down from three and went full speed. let's just say i was a little too rough with my ding\-ding.

after i beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times i had ""spatooshed"". i just assumed i over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so i laid down on my bed to take a nap. the tightness never went away so i had a hard time falling asleep. the tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.

i was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. i told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (i failed to mention that my dangly bits hurt a little bit too) so my dad, being the classic mexican dad that he is, just said ""just drink this 7up and take some tums and you'll be fine in no time."" unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""thats it, i can't take it anymore. we're going to the hospital.""

oh. my. lanta. talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  i thought i was going to pass out from the pain. this was my new worst pain of my life.

we eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. i tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. i didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. so they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. at this point it's been 2\-3 hours since i got there so i say screw it and i finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""hey mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" right away she yells why didn't you say something?! then she calls a nurse to take a look.

the nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then manhandles my beanbags! for those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. so this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! i scream in pain. now, i would never hit a woman in my life but i would be lying if told you i didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. haha. remember when i said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

the surgery was quick and i didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. they went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. i just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then i was back to ""normal"". well, because righty decided to take a left turn at albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. this means righty shrunk. like a lot. lets just say lefty towers over the little guy now. could be worst though. the doctor said 30 more minutes and i would've lost him.

i ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. rob and big, dr. evil and mini me, pinky and the brain are some of my favorites. lol.

lesson to be learned here: some things are meant to be taken slow.

tl;dr  wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.

edit: thank you for the gold kind stranger! glad my story could make your day. :)",4
"by smoking on my apartment balcony (this happened saturday and was without question the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life). this is long and will have a tldr at the bottom.

saturday night my gf and i had my parents over for a  game night. we just moved into our new place last week monday and wanted them to see it. we were waiting on my brother who was running late so i decided to have a smoke on my balcony. 

everything is normal for the first few minutes. i'm just playing some ""free"" game i've spent way too much money on and not aware at all of my surrounding. then it happened. a bug flew in my ear. now this happens occasionally. a bug will fly and hit my ear and be on its way, but this little bastard decided my ear was going to be its new home and dug deep.

i immediately lost all semblance of self control and flung my phone and the chair i was sitting on and sprinted into the apartment while freaking out. the bug was digging or chewing and vibrating and that sound and feeling against your ear drum has to be the worst thing you can ever experience. my gf freezes, my father tells me to get in the shower and just fill my ear with water. i'm helpless at this point so i just follow my dads instructions. 

the bug did not like the water. it dug deeper. the noise and feeling got worse. i used a qtip to try to dig it out. all i got was blood. my father took a used water bottle from my recycling, poked a hole in the cap and used that to try to directly flush the bug. nothing but more digging and moving. i am literally screaming everytime it moves. both from the pain and the disgusting feeling i got when i felt it. 

my mother at this points takes off to run to a store to grab something she thinks will help. i barely notice she leaves but i hope to god she will save me. in the mean time, my gf reads that a couple of drops of vegetable oil can suffocate the bug. so my dad opens our brand new bottle of oil and dumps it in my ear.   at this point my entire body is covered in oil. i could have used concrete as a slip in slide. i'm naked in my shower with a bug in my ear, topped of with oil, holding the shower curtain over my crotch trying to keep some bit of modesty all why freaking out at the chewing next to my brain. 

the oil does nothing but piss it off. we are talking about going to the hospital when my mother returns. she has what looks like the top of a turkey baster. apparently this is something used to suck out booger's from babies noses. my father tries to use it at first because my limbs no longer work. he doesn't go deep enough because he doesn't want to pop my ear drum. i didn't care at that point because the bug was using it as an actual drum already so i managed to regain use of my arm, grabbed the thing and jammed it in my ear. it sucks the bug but it's too big to get it out. too heavy for it to hold onto. 

my gf then fills it with water and suggests i use that to flush the bug. after 4 attempts, i finally feel some relief. i look down on my chest and see something far bigger than i expected. at this point i'm too freaked out to look closely and yell for her to look. she freaks because it's a moth. a good size moth. i again nearly shit myself and rinse it off. 

i can not do justice to this event in words. i can not accurately describe the noise, the feeling, the horror of this. picture it yourselves. imagine you have a dime sized bug in your ear scratching, biting, chewing, digging. then realize it actually feels worse than that. 

if this was punishment for committing crimes, we would no longer need jails. 1 day with a bug in your ear would be enough punishment for murder and i can promise you they wouldn't do it again. 

i'd rather be waterboarded while listening to barney on a loop. those terrorists had it easy. 

i now wear my girlfriends bright pink beats headphones out while smoking and am strongly considering quitting. it shook me that much. 

tldr: a bug flew in my ear while i was smoking. stayed in there for half an hour while i tried everything conceivable to get it out. i finally did. it was more horrific than you can imagine.

edit: i've tried to keep up with the comments so i'll answer some of them here.

i'm still flushing my ear regularly with peroxide. this morning i still found what i think is moth wing residue. i've made an appointment with my primary doctor for 130 this afternoon (eastern time zone us). i'll keep you posted on the egg situation haha. 

i'm now smoking a lot less and mostly when i'm driving . i feel like god would be after me if a bug managed to find its way in my ear driving down the road with the window down only a few inches. 

i didn't expect this to blow up but to everyone commenting saying it happened to them, i'm sorry. i feel your pain. 

to those saying moths don't bite, i'm not exactly a bug expert. all i know is the feeling, the sound, the blood, it was doing something in there that id really rather never experience again. it's truly an indescribable feeling and one i hope you never have to experience.",4
"by leaving my dragon dildos out to dry nsfw. this is literally still happening. maybe it will continue for the rest of my life. maybe this is it for me.

so i live in an apartment-style dorm, but my roommates do not move in for a few more weeks so i am alone in my unit for now. this is very clear because there is a placard with my name and my name only on the front door.

this morning i woke up to the sounds of clanging and walking in my unit. i panicked before my mind supplied ""oh that's the janitor that comes to clean the bathrooms on monday's"". 

and i immediately suffer a heart attack.

it is wednesday. 

i was not expecting a janitor visit. 

in the tub, drying overnight, i had arranged a smorgasbord of sex toy delights: anal beads, a plug, and four dragon/monster dildos of increasing size. lined up. like little sex soldiers.

i hear her open the door to the bathroom, and i lay in the bed in my locked room quiet and still. maybe i'll can stop existing.

i hear some noise, and what sounds like talking.

a few minutes later i hear my ra walk in. i hear some comments and some laughter. they quietly convene for what feels like a long while. the ra simply laments ""why?!"" and the  janitor asks if any boys live in the unit. i continue not to breathe. there are four bedrooms and they don't know which one i use and all the doors are closed so if i continue to be quiet i can astral project off this plane of existence without them noticing.

i currently hear the sounds of a spray bottle, occasionally followed by bag rustling and the tell-tale sound of unsticking a six pound hunk of silicon from a tub. i don't know when she'll leave, if ever. i think i'll be trapped here forever, sweating under the covers from anticipation and embarrassment while she talks and laughs and cleans around my monster dildos.

please send me instructions on how to dissolve into the floor, thanks and have a lovely afternoon.

tl;dr: left all my sex toys out overnight so of course the janitor made a surprise visit this morning and invited the ra to come look at my dragon cocks.

-- / -- / -- / -- / --

update: oh my god this absolutely blew up. i'm going to give an update and answer some questions because i think my phone is going to explode.

-- i emerged from my room about an hour later, my toys were as i left them and there was cleaner in the toilet, so my understanding is that the janitor cleaned the bathroom and perhaps lifted the toys to clean underneath them. i rinsed my things and put them hidden in a drawer in my room. i was waiting to update because i half-expected some communication from my ra but this hasn't happened. sorry the ending isn't juicier but honestly i wouldn't have been able to handle it so i'm thankful.

-- the janitor coming in unannounced is standard procedure. i still have no clue why the ra was allowed in; i'm starting to believe maybe it was, in fact, another janitor? the voice was hushed and i may have misidentified it.

-- a lot of you want pics of the toys. i have a pic of the four in question in a post i made a month or so ago. yes i recommend them, yes they are worth the money.

-- i am ftm, so i am a guy but i currently still have my vagina. i didn't mention my sex or gender because for many reasons it was irrelevant to the story. i put the toys wherever i decide i want them. this clarification is here so that discussion and speculation in the comments is no longer necessary. comments about this aren't going to spark fun or interesting conversations so if you want to argue go do it on a debate forum, not on a funny dildo story.

-- i don't know anything about game of thrones and at this point i'm too afraid to ask

"tifu by selling my nudes to my stepdad. obligatory notice that this happened a couple of days ago, but i'm still recovering from it.



let me introduce myself real quick.
i'm an ethot who sell nudes and feet pics. been doing this for almost 6 months now , cuz life is hard and i need money. i've been reaaally discreet about it tho. my family is too traditional for a closet bisexual hoe like me, and if they were to find out, my head would be on a platter n i knew it. so me, the sneaky know it all i thought myself to be, continued selling nudes n living my best life until the major fuck up  happened.


2 months a ago, an elderly man dm'ed me on twitter  asking to be his sugar babe. knowing the scammers that lurk around, i didn't give much attention to that. his profile was new n anon with a few tweets and no face (has body pics tho) , so my suspicion grew. also, i'm not open about my ethotness on my twitter handle so when he dm'ed out of the blue it felt weird.

but this man was persistent. he dm'ed again after a couple of days, saying that he has noticed the paypigs that follow me and kinda know that i'm an ethot, and if i wasn't one he's sorry. i ignored again. but i was intrigued by this older man who has a decent tl so being the bitch i'm, i started stalking to know if he's legit or not. his page contained mostly political tweets and there was actual people interacting with him. my curiosity grew so i thought it'd be a good idea to text him back- and that's when it all started.


we both kept our anonymity and started having little chats. what started out as  sweet chats transitioned to mad dirty as days went by. he was extremely sweet n sincere . he bought a few of my nudes and then we started trading pics. every night he sent me vids of him jerking off , n i sent him mine. we literally fucked each other virtually. he told he was 45 but his abs said 30 and i was excited to get his dms every night. 18 y/o me somehow felt more valuable cuz  older man with a hot body found my itty bitty titties attractive. it went on like that for a month.

a week ago i got really horny at night n texted him . it was really late but he replied saying his wife is sleeping next to him, and can't sext. i , being the obnoxious dumb doodle i am, somehow thought it'd be a good idea for him to go to the bathroom n film . he did as i said .

i opened the video with the intention of masturbating, but boy, i was in for a surprise.

i noticed the tiles on the wall behind him. at first ,i felt numb , then a shockwave went through my entire freaking body. i recognize the tub. the tiles.the fuckin blue tiles. the same tub i used to bathe. holy fucking shit. that used to be my fuckin room.

my mind went to dumb bitch mode for a while. i sat in my room clueless . tf just happened? did i trip? was that my room? or is my mind making up shit now? the doubt kept me sleepless thru the night. you know the feeling u get when it's your finals next day n you haven't learnt shit? that feeling.

but i wasn't gonna let the doubt kill me.so,to make sure (that i was wrong), the next day i asked him to give me a mirror selfie in his bathroom. and boy, was i right. he's in what used to be my bathroom. the bathroom that i first fucked in. jesus.

i blocked him right away and sat down to process all the mess that happened. i physically revolted. i felt this thing where something goes glsbsks down your chest n abdomen. i virtually fucked my step dad. tf is my life. i don't know what made me feel so disgusted, whether the fact that we used to sext or him cheating on my mom. i felt like telling my mom that he ain't what she thinks he is, but how will i ? we weren't as close as we used to be. ever since she married him i kinda kept a distance. may be that's y i never realized that it was my stepdad. i've only met him in person just twice. also, what evidence would i provide? i felt so disturbed, nauseated and obviously , emotionally scarred. how on earth will i ever face this man again?   pretty sure he's wondering where i  dipped to. and kinda worried to invite them over to my place cuz he know my damn curtains and walls.


tl;dr : sold nudes to stepdad and made him jerk off to me, and now  anxiety and embarrassment are strangling my fucking conscience.


edit: since this blew up i think i should link the dm. it's literally 7:30 here n i haven't slept for over 24 hours so let me get some sleep first. i'll be back. be ready for some laughs at my expense.

"by having sex for the first time in 2.5 years nsfw. obligatory, this didn't happen today, rather three days ago.


i've been single now for three years and haven't knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, i joined a dating site.  


i started talking to this pretty good looking guy. he was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on thursday evening. he looked exactly as he did on his profile (6""8' power lifter who looked like a legit viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that i hadn't been catfiished but i was pretty sure i didn't want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. that said, he didn't seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so i invited him back to mine. 


it started well and i was like fuck yes, let's do this! so i said as much. i also said you're not going to call me back if we do this are you? he said he would. he's a liar. so bullet dodged. 


anyway, he proceeds to pick me up like i weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (i'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. i'm like strip because i've gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. at this juncture, i realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but i figure babies come out of there so i'm grand.



there's a warm up wristy and a little spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. it's over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so i open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he's just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. 


so i'm trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have i got a tissue? my first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. 


blood.jpeg


so much fucking blood. well, i know it's not a wild period since i'm not afflicted with that shit. i run to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. i'm like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. meanwhile i've never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. 


we have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. i clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. like it'll stop. 


nope. next day is agony and still going. trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know i went on a date and i don't want them thinking i'm some harlot. i'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.


wake up saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. but like fresh, bullet wound type blood. and i felt so sick and dizzy. i'm freaking the fuck out. obviously can't tell my mum because catholic shame so i go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who i think thought i had been raped because i was crying so much because i've broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever i think for too long about how this is probably the last time i'll ever have sex and it wasn't even that good. mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she's wonderful.


get in to see the doctor. after a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that i have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. brilliant.

theres surgical glue on my vagina. i'm never dating again.

tl;dr: had sex with a giant viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.

edit: first, wow. i didn't expect this to blow up like this. thanks for reading and thanks for the gold to those who gave it.

second. to clarify, a spider-man as i meant it is also known as the finger trick (middle and ring fingers in, the rest out, pull up repeatedly) although the plah!! spider-man version is also great! hope that helps.

"by forgetting my weed butter in the fridge while my parents staying in my flat. it all happened this morning.

i´m a student  in cologne, germany. my parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat. yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. my dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. she woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. i couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. so my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). after a few minutes i started eating too. i took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. i had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. we made way to much of it so i kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. yeah.. so i took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the wurstbrot. i was shocked and felt like frozen. i didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on. my mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. i asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. so i started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. my mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. for her its a real, hard drug.my dads reaction was pretty chill. he started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. an hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. he started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to amsterdam. i am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.as soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. she is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought i would never do drugs. my dad told me she would calm down soon. they drove home a few hours ago.i think i never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!

tldr: my mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. my dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.

edit: so my mom called me today. she apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. she told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. she has absolutely no relationship to it. she said that she is proud of me and that i should be carefully with smoking weed.   
thanks for all the likes, comments and awards! didn't expect that to happen. i try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed.",4
"my friend brought her new date over for dinner and i jokingly vetted him in front of everyone by asking if'd ever killed anyone. he said yes.. as it's often the case, this didn't happen today, but a few years ago when i was maybe 15yo, young and naive.

my mom's best friend back then was v, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

v is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. after losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. she brought to our home a few men over the years.

one of those times, v had invited over for dinner a man (let's call him a) who she introduced to us as a ""good friend"". a was a middle-aged man originally from bosnia. he now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

for those of you not fully aware of bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. it's a small country in the balkans (eastern europe, north of greece), and it used to be part of the former yugoslavia. long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including a.

that evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know a better. he seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. we start asking him questions about how long he's been out of bosnia, etc.

i start to think of something witty to say to ""vet"" him. something funny.

i asked him if he'd ever killed someone, jokingly.

he looked at me, all serious. he said yes. everyone became silent.

he went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. they were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person's. he wasn't a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.

i felt horrible for asking this. when i thought i was just making a joke, i opened up some really painful memories. things that were not easy for him. still today, many years later, i can't imagine how he must feel living with such memories. and it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

after a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. we never spoke about that again.

—

tl;dr: i thought i'd make a funny joke and ask my friends' date at dinner if he'd ever killed anyone. turns out, he did during the civil war in former yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. the joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day.",4
"by playing music for a sex dungeon. i currently live in an apartment building in seattle. nearby my unit is a man named ""frank"" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why i know her boyfriend's name). now frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of friday and saturday nights. annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, i began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. as an added bonus, i could hear my neighbors yell ""sing"" throughout the night, so i assumed that my playing was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance borne by all of the other neighbors around me.

&#x200b;

however, tonight, i noticed something kind of strange. they were having sex, per usual, and i began to play music to cover up the sound. i stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling ""play."" for some reason, though, i didn't do anything for a few seconds, and i heard the guy, frank's, voice call out ""keep playing or i'm not going to cum"" through the walls. i listened a while longer to see if i'd heard correctly, and they both kept moaning the same thing. it was at this point that i came to a terrible conclusion. in my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, i managed to pull some weird pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, i played guitar and sang. thus, whenever i started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. when i'd heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually frank and his girlfriend. unsure if i was right, i started playing another song and when i finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so i figured that i'd assumed correctly.

&#x200b;

my neighbors them get understandably angry that my music playing has made this neighbor couple have sex, so then ***they*** begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that i've caused this problem (which i have). at this point, i'm listening to frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because i tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.

&#x200b;

edit: here's a video i uploaded as proof that i'm actually playing music. they weren't having sex this morning, so everyone will have to leave that part to their imagination.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyop3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyop3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be)

2nd edit: wow, this really blew up. hopefully everyone enjoyed the story! regarding proof of their sex, i'm not going to record the sound of my neighbors screwing and upload it to the internet, so my apologies there. to answer everyone's questions, the song is an original, but i've never recorded anything professionally and i play as a hobby. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr: thought i was covering up sex sounds with music, turns out i was serenading a couple while they fucked and keeping them horny all night. neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep because i acted as a musical facilitator.",4
"i said no to my gf's proposal.. warning: this is a long one. scroll down to the tl;dr if you don't want the full story. 

yeah... i f***ed up today. see, i've been dating my gf (k) for 5 years. we are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. i've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. the reason i haven't is that about 2 years ago, i got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

it's been very rough on the two of us, but k has stuck with  me every step of the way. my disease, gpa, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. i'm starting drugs that haven't been fda approved for my condition. all other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. this new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. i'm terrified to say the least. all of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

i want to be healthy and stable before i even think about marriage. i don't want to leave k as a widow with no support! k & i had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that i needed to go into remission first. we agreed to it, or so i thought. flash foreword to a few hours ago and k is with my family in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

i saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. i immediately started freaking out. first thought: i haven't even gone into remission yet and i have no clue if i'm going to get better. i cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. what if i die from all of this? second thought: goddamn it dad! why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

i guess i'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my dad was a very involved parent when i was young. when i entered high-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. the expectations would get so high that i couldn't live up to them. similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. both my brothers and i find this to be a real problem, if my dad is left unchecked. i would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. back to the story!

anyway, i'm freaking out. i just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" with my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, i ran out of the building... i made the love of my life cry as i selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. i've never felt so ashamed in my life... after calming down, i talked to my mother, and drove back to talk to k.

in the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. tears were shed and things were said. k told me i was being selfish. ""we've been dating for years, who cares if you die, i want to marry you!"" she also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. she understood why i would be paranoid about my dad though. k understands that my dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

in the end, we reconciled. we made up, decided that i was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. we came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. we want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

now i'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if i do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, i'll be with my best friend/lover. k is my world, and i'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

thanks for listening.



tl;dr
i said no when my gf proposed bc i'm on chemo and don't know if i'm gonna go into remission or die. decided i was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.

edit: thank you so very much for the silver, gold and platinum!",4
"by going to my parents house, and now i need to bleach my eyes.. literally happened ten minutes ago, the fallout has yet to happen.


bit of a backstory, i (26m) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30f) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.


my parents, and my youngest sister (15f) are out of town on vacation. now, i generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. plus i live in an apartment complex and don't have a garage).


so i'm going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.


this is where it happens. now, my parents have two dogs. and i was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as i knew my eldest sister was house sitting and i didn't want them to lose their shit.


this is where the fuckup happens.


it works. i'm quiet. i sneak into the house, and silently close the door. i heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so i go, thinking the dogs were playing.


it was not the dogs playing.


it was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. on the couch.

with her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.


i have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.


i also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. 


and what she sounds like.


i literally screamed ""my eyes"" covered them and ran out of the house.


i'm outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.


send help.



tl;dr parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style.


edit: based on a lot of the responses, apparently reddit wants me to either a) describe my sisters tits, b) make a porno, or c) go all r/sweethomealabama with her.
y'all are animals.

edit 2: holy shit this blew up. damn. what happened after was as i was sitting in my truck, they left. i went into the garage and did my work. we haven't talked yet. i'm gonna give it a few weeks for the memory to not be burned into my skull.",4
"by going for a walk and accidentally traumatising a woman for life. obligatory ""happened a few years ago etc"" but basically there was this walking/bike path near my house that i would occasionally walk along for exercise.

sometimes, while walking, i'd set myself a personal goal, like ""reach that pole by the end of this song"" or whatever (i listened to music while i walked).

well, one time i saw someone walking in front of me. they were a considerable distance ahead of me, but i decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time i reached my turnaround point.

so i started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. at the time i didn't think anything of it, because, hey, we're both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.

as i slowly yet surely got closer to her, i noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. i'd had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, i only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, i'd turn around and look behind me, because i thought she may have heard a bike bell that i hadn't heard over my music. meanwhile i kept my speed up because i was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.

near to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it's of course here that i finally catch up with her..

as i get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what i can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). aimed directly at me.

i immediately realise what i've done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).
i gave her the most awkward smile in the world while i powerwalked past her, walked wayy past my turnaround point so i could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.

as an added ""bonus"", i later learned that there was a notorious rapist named ""the bike path rapist"" that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.

tl;dr decided to race a stranger without their knowledge, awkwardly followed them, caught up to them in the darkest section of the path, nearly got bruce lee'd, awkwardly smiled and powerwalked away.",4
"by flipping off my four year old neighbor.. i'm a salty fucker. i'll admit that from the jump. i can't stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. i can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. he's a little fucking hellion. 

his hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when i get into my car and leave for work. i got so sick of being stared at by this little asshole, so i flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as i was getting into my car. he immediately started screaming and crying. as i drove off, i felt...weirdly satisfied. seriously, it was the most fulfilled i'd felt in weeks. so, i immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. each time he'd start screaming and freaking out. it made me bitterly happy.

this morning, as i was getting ready to leave, i saw the demon child in the window again...giving me the stare...and i flipped him off. only this time i heard the bellow of ""hey fucker!"". the kid's fucking dad had been standing behind him and i didn't see him. i sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the house. i got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn't stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.

i'm at my girlfriend's place right now; my roommate tells me that the fucking psycho has been to the house twice looking for me. kind of dreading going back; thinking that i'll just hang out here for the long weekend and hope it all blows over.

"by wearing my late grandfather's shoes to a job interview. this happened january, 2018.

i was desperate to find a new job and was basically applying for anything that was asking for at least a bachelor's degree. to provide some background, i graduated with a sciences degree and there was a job posting for a junior risk management position at an accounting firm that allowed folks with a stem major to apply. and so i did even though i barely knew anything about the field of accounting or risk management. but hey, might as well.

surprisingly, they invited me to do a ""1-on-0"" interview where you basically stare at your computer webcam and answer questions that the company has prepared for you ahead of time while recording your answer... it's a pretty awful experience. however, they were all soft-skill questions so i could answer them pretty decently. after that, i surprisingly got an invitation to have an interview in-person at their office. i was very excited.

now for the fuckup: my family has an assortment of dress shoes that i could wear for the interview and i ended up grabbing a pair that belonged to my late grandpa. they were lookin fresh. i put em on and my parents dropped me off in front of the building.

i entered the building and entered the conference room where the other 5 candidates were alongside some company reps. i was cool as a cucumber and just sat in my seat until everyone arrived. right as everyone got up to enter the ""group case"" room, i looked down at my feet and noticed there were these black things scattered all around my shoes. i quickly deducted that they were shoe crumbs.

it turns out that the shoes i wore were so old and no one had worn them since... a long ass time ago. they were so old that the polymer in the soles were extremely brittle and my shoes were deteriorating in front of my eyes solely due to pressure and friction.

at that moment, i was just thinking ""oh god oh man"" but didn't want to let anyone know about it so after i got up, i pushed in my chair to hide the shoe crumbs. unluckily for me, everywhere i walked more traces of my shoes came off, leaving a trailing of black shit behind me. it was a nightmare. thankfully the carpet was greyish color so it wasn't too prominent with my black shoe crumbs but it was only a matter of time before people were going to notice. we walked to a different conference room nearby where we did a group case. it didn't go too well and i left another big mess in there but oh well.

afterwards, we were going to do the in-person interviews with the company directors and partners and divided us into two groups where three of us would go the interview first and the other three would do it after. i was a part of the latter team so we had time to kill. one of the company reps wanted to show us around the two floors and in my mind i was screaming. i wanted to minimize walking to prevent my shoes from breaking off even more.

i ended up leaving a trail of crumbs all throughout both floors and then we decided to grab some starbucks on the main floor. when i went to go grab a straw for my iced coffee, a giant block from my right shoe came off. holy shit. i kicked it into the little condiments corner and hoped no one saw. we sat down at a table until our turn for interview was approaching. on the way back to the office floor, a second massive chunk came off, this time from my left shoe. however, this time i was in the middle of the cafeteria and couldn't go back to grab it or something. so i just continued walking and just left this black shoe turd in the middle of an open space. at this point, so much of my shoes have fallen off that i was starting to walk weirdly, as my shoes has gotten so much fucked at this point.

we got back to the conference room and the moment i entered the room, i noticed two other people hovering around where i was sitting originally and said ""what's all this black stuff?"" looking at debris i had left earlier. i pretended to not hear them and sat at a different chair, attempting to engage in conversation with someone else. at this point, i was 99% sure everyone knew it was me. however, i continued to play innocent and not acknowledge the amount of debris i was leaving behind everywhere.

finally, it was my turn to do the interview and i walked to yet another office to do it, and of course that meant leaving more shoe crumbs along the way and in the boss's office. he told me he was gonna take a quick bathroom break after we entered and will be right back. i was so glad he did that as i frantically picked up the crumbs that i had already laid waste upon his office and quickly stuffed as much as i could in my pockets while he was gone. as i was doing this, all i could think was ""how did it come to this..."". the interview itself went pretty well though.

after everyone was done, the reps ended up buying lunch for us at a nearby restaurant. all i can say is rip to the cleaning staff over there. by the time i got home, you could almost look through my shoe, top-down.

needless to say, i did not get the job.

tl;dr: wore old af shoes to an interview, the soles began to deteriorate as i walked around and shuffled them, leaving an absolute disaster of a mess all around their offices as i continued to not acknowledge that i was the culprit even though i'm very certain everyone knew it was me.",4
"by shaving my butthole before a first date.. edit1: technically ""trimmed"" not ""shaved""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

so the happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...

this is gonna be tmi, but that's kinda the nature of tifu, so whatever. i'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. i also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and i don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (aka the taco bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it ain't fun. so i had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. so i trimmed it off at night, added some aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. win-win!

fast forward two days, and i'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl i've dated, so i wanna shell out the monies of course. dinner went pretty well, and we got coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.

but, guys, i can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  we're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and i just had to let one out. i'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so i'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. and this fart was not silent! it was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart i've ever had in my entire life, hands down. i was mortified. she immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and i of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. she did not laugh with me...no text-backs so far.

i googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. so a little there for you inside this tifu. just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so i can go on dates again.

&#x200b;

edit2: man i shouldve used my real account for the awards! guess i'll have to switch over to this baby.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - i shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. turns out it makes your farts super loud, which i discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after.",4
"by listening to my gf's obviously stupid game.. so, yesterday my girlfriend and i were playing around, you know as lovers do...naked. some time in this whole play activity, she asked if i could stick my penis in a bottle.

now, this was a weird thing to me but i thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so i went ahead and did it. it didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes i know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. she started laughing and i started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. she never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. she knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. i begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. now my dick was straining and i started to get really worried. then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.

long story short, she started crying and finally stopped. the bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts). since yesterday, peeing still hurts. she thought i wouldn't be stupid enough to proceed with putting my limp dick in a snuggly fitting bottle.

tl;dr i fucked up my dick by putting it in a bottle.

**edit**: so my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.

if you come back here to check, no i'm not taking it down, i am the one with the sore dick and no one can tell from the story that it is us because we told no one (well i hope you didn't). sorry, i'm keeping it up. see you at 8.",4
"by not checking who was in the house. nsfw. sorry about the formatting, i'm on mobile. 

me (23f) and my boyfriend (22m) have both been struggling with mental health stuff recently so we've not really been *in the mood* (if you know what i mean).
so today we were making out and things were starting to get a little heated so my boyfriend asks me to check there's nobody else home. normally he means to just check out of the window and see if either of his parents cars are in the driveway which they weren't so i tell him we're all good. we proceed to have very loud, somewhat kinky sex. 
after we're finished he goes to the bathroom to clean up and makes a jokey comment about how we left the bedroom door open and that it's a good thing nobody else is home. then we realise we can smell food cooking. i never checked if his younger sister was in the house. she definitely heard us and everything that was said during. i have never been more embarrassed.

tl,dr: me and boyfriend have kinky sex, his younger sister is in the house and definitely heard us.",4
"by pitching a really fucking stupid slogan to my only cool client. i'm in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. so, a few days ago i was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: they had an uncharacteristically shitty location.

there's no way people were just finding this place on their own. it was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. so, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

last night, i went there to get some food... for research, ya know... anyway, i was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. the pizza was really good. the beer selection was varied. they had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. pretty good stuff. even if i wasn't writing for them, i would've given them 5 stars on yelp, is what i mean.

when i was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

i wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""where wine country is next door!""), but i was determined to get something usable. 

finally, it hit me: ""go somewhere."" it had nearly everything i wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

but, still, it wasn't quite there. it lacked the feel i wanted, felt a little too abstract. customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. they needed to be pointed.

after another hour or so, i had it.

eventually, the slogan i pitched these poor people was this:

""go somewhere else""

which, i believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""get the fuck out of my face.""

they haven't emailed me back.

tl;dr: today i fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan i wrote and i'm pretty sure i definitely lost a client because of it.",4
"by using the faceapp everyone's been raving about. so i guess this is a bit of a change from your normal posts but i felt like sharing anyways.

so this just happened like an hour ago. i'm sure you all have heard about the ""revamping"" of the faceapp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. for those who don't know what i'm talking about, here(https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.

anyways, so i saw someone post a picture to their instagram and that's how i heard about it. i knew i had to download it and try it out...because why not?

so i download the app, take a picture and set the filter. 

and omg i'm totally old lol. it's kinda crazy, and i'm not gonna lie...i look good as an old dude.

i decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. we start comparing pics and wonder if that's how we will really look in the years to come.

then a thought pops into my head...

everyone tells me i look just like my dad, and if that's true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! so i send it away!

...nope.

he isn't excited, and he isn't laughing. he said it freaks him out.

i asked him why, and assured him it's just a harmless filter.

what he said next broke my heart.

""i know i'll never see you that old.""

tl;dr: i used the crazed faceapp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. fuck.

edit: whoah!! did not expect this response. thank you strangers for my first gold!!!

edit 2: thank you for my second and third gold!!! wow.",4
"by not wearing pants to a job interview. this happened today, 8:30am.

i cannot even try to make an excuse for how i could have literally forgotten a vital piece of clothing.

i got pretty close. i donned my favourite opaque tights and chose my shirt then i proceeded to get distracted by some forms i had to complete online, ran short on time, put on my long winter parka and left the house.

i got up to the interview feeling very comfortable and fifteen minutes early. as the receptionist told me to go hang up my coat i gladly walked over to do so. i began to unzip my jacket, looked down and for a brief moment i thought my skirt had just ridden up on my commute. nope, nothing there. luckily i never fully took off my jacket.

i proceeded to turn on my heel and leave. i got downstairs but was still holding the coat hanger.

i didn't want to be a theif on top of just leaving abruptly. so i then took the elevator back up, claimed a family issue, and returned the coat hanger.

silver living is they let me reschedule. so now i have an interview for later this afternoon. in about an hour.

tl;dr left my house without any pants on for a job interview then absconded with company property

edit: i think the job interview went well. i appreciate everyone's encouragement, and also thank you for the silvers.

i'm also happy (?) that so many other people have gone to work in various states of undress.

and to the people who are/ are now afraid of coming to their work places 'naked': i'm sorry! this was also a latent fear of mine too, and the stuff of my nightmares. i can't believe it actually happened and that 'checking for pants' will now become part of my routine.",4
"by eating first and asking questions later.  

my fiance and i have been eating keto for the last 3 months. she recently bought these ""butter bombs"" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. i saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because i hadn't used one yet.

i proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. i threw it in the blender and glugged it down. i thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. it didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.

smash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as i'm watching tv, ""hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?"" smh. my fat ass thought it was food. i suppose i should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 stars, would eat again.

 tl;dr i ate air freshener wax thinking it was a keto ""fat bomb"" because i'm a fat ass.",4
"by mistaking my coffee thermos for my wife's.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but happened a while back.

&#x200b;

so for christmas, my wife got her and me matching coffee thermoses. hers was copper tinted, mine was stainless steel. apart from that they were identical. i loved it! but after a while, being the absent minded person that i am, mine goes missing. ""no biggie"", i said to myself, ""my wife is staying home today, i'll just take her thermos to work."" so i fixed me up a nice thermos full of black coffee, and headed out the door to work.

this particular day was rather busy, and i had meetings back to back pretty much all morning. i had my thermos and laptop in tow, and was migrating from one conference room to another, when i realized i needed to run to the urination station. so i dropped off my laptop and thermos, ran and relieved myself, then stopped back by my cubical to pick up a couple of reports for the meeting.

while sorting the papers at my desk, i reach over and grab for my thermos and take a big swig of coffee. immediately, a few alarms and thoughts went through my head. ""this coffee got pretty cold pretty fast today...that's odd. also i don't remember putting any cream or sugar in it this morning...that's odd. also what is this texture??""

at this point, still mid-gulp, i shift my eyes down to the top of the thermos, which has a clear plastic lid, and i notice a very large floating blob of mold, which i had just taken a sizable chunk out of. also i notice the thermos is stainless steel, not copper colored.this was my coffee that had been sitting on my computer desk, in plain sight, for a month. oh no...i thought as i immediately reach for the trashcan to try and lurch the coffee back out, but to my disappointment it would not come back up. so i run to the bathroom and try a full on puking position to try and get it back up, again no luck. i just knew i was going to get deathly ill, but actually i didn't get sick beyond the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: took my thermos to work, forgot about it. took my wife's to work a few weeks later. accidentally drank from my month old coffee and got a nice dose of penicillin and rotten cream.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit:  my apologies to anyone i made chunder this morning!

edit 2: for clarification - i just borrowed my wife's thermos, filled it with fresh coffee, and took it to work. hers wasn't the moldy one. mine was, as it had been setting at my desk for a month.",4
"by thinking my welsh - english bi lingual boyfriend was having a stroke, i caused a car crash. i've been with him for roughly a month and i knew he spoke welsh fluently but i've never heard him, or anyone speak welsh. 

we are driving to his house and he's on a call with one of his friends so i'm just sat on my phone, relaxing, enjoying the hills. well, he suddenly starts speaking welsh and flinging his arms around, apparently having some sort of an argument. ive never heard welsh before and tbh, it sounded more like lots of slurring. 

i legitimately thought he was having a stroke so i grabbed the steering wheel, he did the exact same thing but in the opposite direction, he out strengthed me, we span around on the road and came to a stop. 


he was so confused as to why i randomly grabbed the wheel. i explained the situation and now his welsh family and friends are having a great laugh at my mono-language self.

"chatting with my gynaecologist. so, i went in for a routine lady checkup right. these visits are awkward from start to finish... the hype yourself up to be able to leave the house, the play-it-cool conversation before taking your pants off.. and oh god, the cleaning beforehand. pretty sure i've discovered a new layer of skin from all the scrubbing. pubic hair? what is that. 

so, enter the doc's office. awkward prelims, tick. pants off, tick. on the table (please tell me this piece of disposable paper has been changed since the last patient) my ass is vulnerable right now

fast forward to the speculum *shivers* now it's just silence. silence and this guy, just having a stare off with my lady taco. after a few horrifying silent seconds, i decide it would be a good idea to make small talk. (only god knows why) clearly out of creative ideas, i blurted ""a lot of cobwebs up there"" 

the doc stops moving and chuckles awkwardly.. after what feels like an eternity he says, ""not having an active sex life then?"" 

awesome. no. i meant the ceiling!!! your ceiling. not my vagina. *crawls into a hole and dies*

for some reason he thought this was way funnier then i did. so yep. should i change gynaecologists, can't bear to 'face' him again.  😅😅

"by finding my gf's porn videos and confronting her about it. this actually did happen today and i'm still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.


basically me and my gf of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. we're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. long distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. great right? wrong.


last night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. i went home with blue balls, and decided that i was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. after going in and out of sleep, i eventually decided that i needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.


i loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until i found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. i got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. the girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. exactly like my girlfriend. i was thinking ""oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes"", and began to jack it.


but once the fucking started, my heart stopped. she had the same birthmark as my gf did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. this wasn't a look alike, this was my girlfriend. i grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.


i checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. i was hesitant, but clicked on it. turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen i was looking at page after page, video after video of my gf being railed by giant porn dicks. my girl wasn't as innocent as i thought. she was a porn starlet.


i was so fucking torn right then. so many feelings started running through my brain. it now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. she was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.


i then started freaking out about stds. none of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. we were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now i was terrified i had been duped. not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. i realized that it was late enough that i couldn't do anything so i went to bed again.


i woke up the next morning in cold sweats. i was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. i sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book i could think of. i called up my doctor's office and scheduled an std test. fortunately they could take me right then so i drove over. 


after the tests were finished, i got a text from my girlfriend. ""what the fuck are you talking about???"". i was even angrier than before. that little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  i was furious, but i had evidence. she wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining. 


i fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but i couldn't find the casting one i started on last night. no worries, i remember her stage name. i typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what i found. not because i was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. they didn't exist.


now i was just fucking confused. i tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. i knew i saw them last night tho, so i knew they were there though, right?


and that's when the realization hit. remember how i said i was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? it was all a dream. a very bad dream. my brain decided that a great dream to have would be my girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.


so here i am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how i had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names i called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so i think we're good for now.


tl;dr: had a very realistic dream that my gf was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a doctors office taking std tests for diseases i don't have.


edit: ok holy shit this blew up overnight. i can't reply to most of the comments/questions/concerns so i'll try to break it down by groups that i see most frequently commenting.


for everyone saying the relationship is done: surprisingly not. she took it pretty well and were talking this through pretty openly. i'm gonna go over later tonight in person just to make sure, but it hasn't gone nearly as bad as i thought it would.


for the conspiracy theorist: nah, the videos don't exist. she didn't pull them or anything, there were enough videos that on a normal ph page there would definitely be at least one re upload. i checked my browser history, nothing there, and nothing is ever deleted on the internet, and i trust my gf so i'm fine on that note.


for the ""yta"" crowd: yeah i know that's why this is on and not on wholesome stuff or smthn.


for the ""sex work is real work, you're just misogynistic"" crowd: sex work is a real job and i'm not contesting that. i also don't care if my partners body count is as long as troy polamalu's hair, or as short as oj simpsons prison sentence. what i got mad at was that she was currently banging dudes without my knowledge, breaching my trust of her, and crossing a deal breaker for me. obviously it never happened but that was what i was mad at, not anything else.


for everyone getting mad at me for not knowing how porn std tests work: thanks. now i know i guess?


also shout-out to the one guy who thinks it's fake solely bc he never heard of jacking off in bed before. can't find your comment but it gave me a good chuckle.",4
"by receiving 2nd degree burns on my butthole.. so this happened roughly about 4 hours ago. insert generic ""i'm on mobile"" text here. 

so i was getting ready for work and stepping out of the shower.
i don't know about you guys, but i really like to use a hair dryer on
every part of my body. i've got hair all over my body, so it makes sense i guess.

i use the hairdryer to dry my (head) hair, then my torso and then my legs... and then...
my butt. you see, i'm a guy and there's some hair down there. it's not always
easy to dry it with a towel so i just use the hair dryer. 

i would get out of the shower, use a towel to dry myself as much as possible 
and then let the hair dryer do the rest.

for the last 10 years this technique has worked perfectly fine.. except for today.

you see, somehow my hands were still wet. for some reason i didn't notice this. so
while i was spreading my butt cheeks to dry the hair between them the hair dryer slipped
out of my hand. i quickly cought the power cable but by doing that the hair dryer was rammed
directly between my buttcheeks while it was still on.

the hair dryer was on the highest setting and the moment it hit my butthole i was shocked.
i instantly clenched my buttcheeks together while the hairdryer was still in there and running.

god, i can't tell you how much this fucking hurt. it still does. it's literally the worst pain.
like, i know the anus is relatively sensitive but this was just pure hell. the pain was so horrible
i was literally unable to loosen my butt cheeks. the hairdryer was blowing hot, and i mean hot air directly on my butthole
for about 7 full seconds. i managed to get my shit together and pull the plug.

but by the time i pulled the plug the damage was already done. i fell on the floor and puked all over
the place. the pain was unbearable. i was crying, screaming and i think i even might've passed out for
a couple of seconds at a time.

i was laying on my bathroom floor for 30 miniutes trying to somehow live through this immeasurable pain.

it was horrible. but after half an hour of laying there i realized i had to move, this had to be treated, so i tried to reach for my phone to call help. but when i tried to crawl to my phone i realized that the hair dryer was still
between my butt cheeks!

so i tried to pull it out and that was the second time i puked due to the pain. when i got it out it was covered
in bloody/burnt off parts of my butt's flesh. i have no clue how it looks down there but it can't be any better than
how i'm feeling right now.

i eventually managed to call my girlfriend. she drove me to the hospital.

so... that's basically it. i'm currently laying in a hospital bed. the wound has been 'treated'. it was so humiliating.
the pain is still horrible but they gave me painkillers so i guess that'll help.
this is literally the worst day of my life. i've not only felt the worst pain you can imagine, i've also never been
more embarrassed/ashamed.

but i really have to give credit to the nurses/doctor who treated me. they did perfect. they tried to cheer me up
and they were totally nice. i'm so grateful.

also, i really hope i could explain this properly but if you had problems here's a visual depiction of what went down:

https://imgur.com/a/yinsqgn

so, if you're reading this you've probably stopped laughing by now. so thank you for reading this giant wall of text.

i'll try to keep you guys updated.

tl;dr: i received 2nd degree burns on my butthole after i accidentally rammed my hair dryer between my butt cheeks.

***edit***: insert generic rip inbox line here. time to make my first edit. so, the last couple of hours have been a  blast. you guys are so f*cking amazing. your responses are the best things i've seen all year tbh. i'm glad i could make some of you laugh. you people brought me joy and happiness. it really sucks laying in this bed. i might get released soon. the wound has been cleaned but we have to keep an eye on it so it doesn't get infected. the doctor said the worst part is over but pooping will be a problem. but thanks to all your happy comments i'll manage, hopefully. oh, my gf finally stopped laughing; better tell her to order some aloe vera quickly ;)

***edit2***: for the people wondering why i need a hair dryer for my entire body. here's a selfie: https://imgur.com/a/xzm7unc

***edit3***: here's a video of the aftermath https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eqf0ea-tjm&feature=youtu.be

***edit4***: holy hell, this story is everywhere on reddit. well, despite all the agony i'm so incredibly glad to see how many people it reached. you guys are the best. this has been the worst day of my life but all your support and help made it better. you've helped me live through this terrible day. thank you.  https://imgur.com/a/jphbzho

***edit5, the morning after***: so i woke up about an hour ago and i had to poop. it was mostly soft and the skin wasn't stretched that much but holy fuck that hurt. i was able to clean my butt on a bidet so that's alright for now. this might be my last edit on this post. maybe i'll post an update in a few weeks/months. anyways, i'm gonna focus on my recovery. to all the kind commenters: you're amazing, never stop! https://imgur.com/a/mmsrprd",4
"and my son ended up thinking santa clause was stealing penises.. so my wife comes home after picking our two youngest kids up from school. she opens the door and goes, ""did you say something about santa clause stealing penises?""

i reply, ""i didn't say any shit like that. i would never ruin christmas.""

here's how we got there:

i have two daughters and a son. my son was 3 or 4 at the time. he refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. my daughters weren't having any of it and were like, ""this is your department, old man. do something.""

i tried to reason with my son and that just didn't work. i was thinking that i needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. he's a tiny kid. he'll play with a cardboard box and be happy. 

that's when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. that's it. he loves his dick. i love my dick. me and my penis are tight. 

so my son and youngest daughter are eating lunch. i look across the table and go, ""hey big guy, you know how sometimes you can't go to sleep cause you think there's something in your closet?""

hesitantly, ""... yes.""

""i didn't want to scare you but you're old enough to know now.""

his eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. she's 4 years older. 

i go, ""there's a goblin that lives in your closet. and if you don't do what you're supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you're asleep and steals your penis.""

he incredulously responds, ""nah ah.""

i reassure, ""oh yeah. what do you think happened to your mom and sisters?""

at this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. she's holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. 

my son was dead silent. i could almost hear him thinking, ""damn... they don't have dicks.""

so where does santa clause come in?

after i told my wife i would never ruin christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, ""you must have done something really bad for santa clause to steal you penis.""

my guy confused goblins with santa somehow and thought santa clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. 

fear not. i straightened him out. i googled pics of santa and pics of goblins from the movie labyrinth. 

tldr: tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking santa clause was stealing dicks.

"by having sex with a tampon in, losing it, and having to get my professor remove it (nsfw). this happened last night. put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. i had a busy night, but at the end of the night i got to see my boyfriend. totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. i have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an iud, so between that and my busy day i totally forgot i had a tampon in. 

we wake up this morning and i remember. my stomach drops. i immediately go to the bathroom and i can't feel it. its gone. i tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything i could think of. nothing. after close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the vagina gods, i accept my fate. this shit is gone. 

at this point i'm worried that i'm never finding this thing and it's going to be stuck inside of me forever. i also know the risk of contracting tss if i keep it in much longer so i know i need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. after class i'm off to our student health center. i go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. i strategically timed it so that i wouldn't see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, gen med, at night once a week. i wasn't keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so i was hoping the nurse could do it. 

nurse is very nice and reassuring but says i have to wait for the doctor. great. some time later i'm in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. he comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing i wanted. really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn't know me. 

he starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:
dr, to the nurse: ""well, she got some pretty good news last night""
me: "".........""
dr: ""theres no final in gen med!""
me: ""..oh""

i for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. don't get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. 

he finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. i have his class in a few days. not sure how i'm going to look at him. i'm a 4.0 student and i've never felt more stupid in my entire life. 

tl;dr: forgot i had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. 

edit: i was dumb enough to say ""stupider"" instead of more stupid, as many of you have pointed out. its been a long day, ya'll. 
 
edit 2: turns out ""stupider"" was fine. lesson learned: those terms are interchangeable, trust your gut. also, take your tampon out before sex. 

edit 3: wow, i didnt really expect this post to blow up like it did. thanks for making a story about my vagina make the front page, guys. 
for those of you asking, it ended up near my cervix. it was too small/deep for me to have much success getting it myself, because when you lean forward to do a self-exam, the vaginal canal tightens. 
thanks for the supportive messages, i didn't realize this was such a common problem. makes me feel a lot better, lol. ",4
"by thinking i had a family history of glaucoma after finding my dad's weed 17 years ago. tldr at the bottom

17 years ago i passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. being a huge nerd i checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when i found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. i just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. i handed it to him, said i didn't care who it belonged to but if i ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. he just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, ""it's your mom's for her glaucoma"". whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.

&#x200b;

i was at a family a dinner awhile ago and i can't remember what someone said but i replied with, ""yeah, because mom has glaucoma"" and my mom goes, ""i don't have glaucoma"" and i, incredulously, said ""dad said you had glaucoma"", in which my dad responds to with, ""what the hell are you talking about, i never said that"". after reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe i believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. i told them i had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit i'd been on for the past like 15 years. they just laughed harder.

&#x200b;

tldr: i found my parent's weed stash when i was 16, they told me it was for glaucoma, i believed them for almost 2 decades.

&#x200b;

edit: this was my first post, thank you so much for the flair!

edit 2: sorry for those saying this is made up but i really was (am) just a huge nerd/goody two-shoes and was terrified of getting in trouble. yes my parents were cooler than me and still are and no i didn't appreciate that until i was much older

edit 3: the only time i remember a doctor/optometrist ever really commenting on it was when i went to have lasik when i was like 26/27 and they said they did a more in-depth exam before approving me for the surgery",4
"by hiding in my girlfriend's room while her parents are home. as the title says, i am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend's room. 

you may be thinking she's here with me, scared to be caught, but she's not. in fact she's nowhere near me, because she's at school.

my girlfriend and i live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. my girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she's asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).

on wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. the plan was simple, i would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and i would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.

it went great, i made it out, even ran to my car which wasn't necessary because by the time her dad was coming back i was driving out of her neighbourhood. 

fast forward to that night and i end up going back over. thursday goes good, i go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. 

now it's friday morning. her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. then she leaves, i lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where i'll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. 

her dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. fuck. it's locked. he pauses, turns the light on, i assume he looks in her brother's room, then tries the door again. still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. he says something to himself (i don't speak chinese but i really wish i did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.

i text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared i am to get caught. she tells me to chill, tells me they don't have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. she texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. her dad doesn't always listen so that worries me.

pretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn't awake. now i'm currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because i can't do anything.

escaping is impossible. her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. plus i have no idea what time her mom wakes up.

i have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but i doubt i will. anyone have any advice? she's 19, i'm 20, her parents don't even know she has a boyfriend.

i imagine they'll be beyond pissed if they find out i'm here, we'll both be fucked. not only is she dating me but i'm staying in her house without them knowing. it's scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn't even know it, i feel bad for doing this but i love my girlfriend and i'm literal melted butter in her hands.

update: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now i have to poop really badly. about 6 more hours to go though. rip my bowels and my asshole. also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so i have to be very careful with what i do on the bed, sleeping position wise.

update 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: i still have to poop, not as badly though. however a new probably has arose. i grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of hawaiian bread. i ate the egg obviously because i can't really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. tummy feels a bit weird. hope i don't throw up because it's very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. also think of napping but too afraid i'll let out a massive fart or make some noise. girlfriend stopped replying due to class. i've given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. the dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. mom is high level once she wakes up though. hopefully she'll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn't awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. 

quick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, i think she'll make breakfast or something. dad is talking to mom, don't know what about. hope they don't try the door again, really feel like i'm gonna shit and throw up now.

good update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure i can hear her dad snoring. i can finally relax a little. might actually catch some shut eye. off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.

okay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom's long gone for sure, dad's asleep, not snoring but i'm pretty sure he's sleeping. unfortunately girlfriend hasn't answered texts for the last two hours i think. finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens i get spooked. i'm glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. not really sure how to prove it's real. as i said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. hoping it doesn't come to that. dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in china so his body is in another time zone. might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. thanks for the good luck. see you in an hour or when something interesting happens. 

updated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. so far dad's still asleep, mom is at work, ac still spooks me. here's some answers to questions: gf's birthday is late, yes dad works but ""he can't handle work"" so he goes later (around 6 i think?), and i'll make it clear now i'm not planning to escape, it would be stupid. i truly think gf's dad doesn't care enough to try and bust down the door. also yes, florida is a stand your ground are but dad doesn't own guns, just knives (i feel like i could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so i know how to run and fight). to those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then i'd have no problem doing that. as for my poop situation, i still have to go but it's not that bad anymore. yes i have a bit or orange and bread left, and i have headphones that are supplying me with some nice spotify service. also, i played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. see you in an hour. 

not really an update but i'll post link to gf and i'd texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) proof reddit(https://imgur.com/gallery/9pv91je) 

update again: uhhhhh i didn't see a post that got deleted. i deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but i uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. if this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? as for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. i'm probably going to watch some youtube or netflix, since sleeping isn't a good idea. i'll update in an hour as always. 

update: try using your phone to view. anyway good news. as we speak i am shitting in the toilet. dad left. pooping has never felt so good. i'll update you when my girlfriend comes back.

update: girlfriend is home, i pooped as soon as the dad left. yes i know it's stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home i'm safe. for those who are asking why didn't i leave when i got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and i didn't have my bag packed. there will be one more update after this when i get home, the true safe zone. as for now the girlfriend and i are going to play fifa and chill until i have to leave. 

final update: hello i am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend's parents. i have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. about my girlfriend's age,,, she went to school in china at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she's making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. she's not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, no boyfriend. for those of you saying she's an adult her parents don't control her... they do. as long as she lives there and they support her financially. not to mention she isn't white... she's asian (chinese specifically). i myself am italian/cuban, so the same rules go for me until i move out (planning to before the end of next year).  many of you ask why i didn't leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. first off i had to poop so badly. secondly i won't see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so i've been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn't need to go to the hospital (mom's a nurse, taught me everything since i was young). i wanted to be there for her in person. also yes, her parents own a restaurant. i won't post anymore updates (99.9% chance i won't bc it's over) but will reply to dm's and replies :)

final permanent update: yes it's about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. i'm glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. i'm currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, i'm mentally and physically better than when i did this stupid shit. i will never do this again, and i don't suggest anyone else does it, i had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if i was the dad and found out i would be beyond pissed. sorry mr.ex's dad. yeah, i hope everyone is doing well, i'm doing better, enjoy your day/night :)



tldr: currently staying in my girlfriend's room while her parents are home, doors locked, dad tried to get in, parents don't even know i exist, no escape route. also have to shit really badly.",4
"by missing my own graduation. i was supposed to graduate with my masters degree and had invited my whole family to attend my graduation. the only problem was that i told them all that my graduation was on sunday because i actually thought it was on sunday. people booked tickets, and cousins were coming from all over america. 

this morning i wake up at 11:30 and was casually seeing my instagram stories to see everyone in robes. my official school account also was posting about people graduating today. so i went back to the email they sent a few weeks ago on the graduation dates -- turns out i missed graduation. i'm still lying in bed calculating the magnitude of my stupidity. i don't even know what i'm going to tell everyone in my family who's going to come down to ""see me walk"". i missed my own graduation!! 

tl;dr: thought i was graduating on sunday but the graduation was today.

edit: just found out there is also individual department ceremonies at the university of florida. i missed the university-wide ceremony but i can still go to the engineering department ceremony on monday!!!

thank you u/ifntchingyu",4
"by trying to edit a headshot without permission, hr is involved.. tl;dr at bottom.

i work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. a portion of what i do is handling the corporate website. one of our mid-level professionals (i'll call her gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. it's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.

every year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. it's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.

so, gina's paper is being published, and i'm called on to do all the marketing around it. this includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.

the thing is, gina's headshot is a little... off.

as a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. not a little ""maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch"" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.

so, i can't exactly call up and ask if i should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation i want to have, and i'm also not known as the most tactful person. i'm very familiar with photoshop, and use it all the time (i've got no graphic design qualifications though, so i'm very slow by comparison), so i go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. i'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.

i work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. still, it's not something i want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, i alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.

lo and behold, gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. as she comes by, i hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. she comes in and freezes, asks what i'm doing. i say im just tweaking a picture, and when i look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.

she gets louder and asks what the fuck i'm doing fixing her chest area. she then asks if i'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. for some reason, i decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say i'm evening out the skin tone.

she dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.

about an hour later, i get an email from hr saying that i need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  i ask if i can speak privately first, and explain the situation. i still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and ""make her prettier"". i acknowledge that, but also mention that i tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, i'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. 

we have the meeting, and i had to explain the whole thing to gina directly. she is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. she's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). she then goes on to suggest that i altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).

i then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the hr rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.

she's still livid, and hr suggest that i should jump off this project. 

i'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. i told my boss the whole story and he's assured me i'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.

tl:dr: tried to edit a moustache out of a female colleague's professional headshot, didn't want to embarrass her by letting other people see, she walks by and i reflexively scroll down to hide the mouth and it looks like i'm zoomed in on her breasts. ",4
"by unwrapping a condom. so this happened earlier in the week but is nsfw so posting on the weekend. also on my throwaway acc. since i don't want this story going back to the irl me.

so at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. i'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. it never has and so i took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

anyway, i'm on intersemester break right now so i (19m) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. i decided i'd open the wrapper since i'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and i thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

as i discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason i took a smell since i could kind of tell it smelt weird.

when i did this, i realised that i had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. i have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when i was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. except now i realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. i felt pretty sick then.

i wish i could delete memories and that i'd never remembered/realised this.

tl;dr  got out a condom to try it out, realised i've tasted condoms before.

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. i have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. i think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.

i think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that ""pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc."" i'm also from new zealand, not north america as a few have assumed. here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me ""the talk"" either.

the ""balloon"" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.

thank you for the awards, i wish they could make me forget, at least there is a small positive now from fake internet points.",4
"tifu by loudly telling a female workmate i was going to finger her. so i (m 22) work in a factory that is slightly short staffed, so from time to time some of the office staff have to come through to the factory and help out. one of these office workers is a (f 18) who we'll call jess. so jess was in the factory helping out and i happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. now jess and i have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as i was passing her she looked at my gloves and said 

""you look like you're about to go finger a cow""
(which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) 

so me being the master of wit that i am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! if i say the right thing i could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
my brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was

""i'll finger you""

not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
because of the level of noise i  the factory i have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. it just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
at this point i wanted to just crawl into a hole, but i stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""i meant that as though you're a cow, not that i actually want to finger you""

this seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
i can't look jess in the eye any more. works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

tl/dr:  female workmate said i looked like i was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response i said ""i'll finger you."" now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

"by trusting some rando on airbnb. shit river 2k19

we have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with our dear friend paul from august 3rd to august 4th, 2019. let me spin you a tale...a tale of shit river.

4:30 pm

our initial impressions of the house were terrific! our illustrious host, paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. paul was friendly! check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. everything was looking great!

6:00 pm

we return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. we fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. we had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! a few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.

8:15 pm

after a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. we discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). plunging half successfully, we messaged paul and let him know the situation. only one working toilet isn't ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we'd make it work!

8:38 pm

the remaining toilet won't flush. the party grows worried. paul assures us that he will call a plumber.

9:00 pm

paul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won't be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. a five second google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in virginia beach, but paul did not want to call them. after ""informing"" our dear friend paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. a plumber was found! magic!

9:30 pm

raw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. the house likely possessed. drinks have been drunk like it's the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or uber to safety. after all, where would we go? we pray to whatever eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.

10:01 pm

the stench. dear god. the stench.

11:20 pm

emergency plumber arrives with paul and paul's friend in tow. one of them goes to the roof. one of them pounds a pabst blue ribbon. advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. we split the party.

12:20 am

plumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for ""the final blasting."" paul's friend fails to discover how to ""switch off his nose"" and taps out (""i'm out man, i'm out.""). it's been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. the backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *for now.*

12:22 am

paul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. classic paul! we oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.

12:24 am

the final blasting. the stench. the horror. the splatter. we all take 2d6 damage.

1:00 am

paul & co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. he requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. we decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. we also decide to leave the next morning.

2:00 am: the witching hour

lights flicker ominously. the house isn't finished with us yet…

4:30 am

paul offers a full refund (excellent). he later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). we ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. he offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).

10:30 am

the party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. we take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the toilet gods.

11:10 am

we commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. after completion, we agree never to speak of this again. who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?

11:11 am

the great gurgle. we hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. was it the broken spirit of paul's friend chugging another pbr? nope. the shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.

11:15 am

we hasten our efforts to flee. paul is called. we finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.

11:30 am

we convene to discuss departure. suddenly, one of our party realizes we've been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping shit river pooling in the hallway. fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the rubicon. we form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.

11:32 am

water oozes up from the baseboards. satan's septic tank thirsts for blood. the lights flicker once more.

11: 35 am

our dearest friend paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: ""this house is fucked."" agreeing with paul's uncanny observation, we flee the house. the smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.

tl;dr i trusted my airbnb to have functional plumbing but instead it exploded.",4
"by applying for engineering jobs and telling employers i'm retarded. so this has been going on since i graduated in may and started applying for jobs. i've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and i have not had much feedback. well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since i have adhd, i have been checking the box marked ""intellectual disability"" all these months. 


so about fifteen minutes ago i'm going through an application like normal and i get to the part where they ask about disabilities. this is what it reads: ""intellectual disability (formerly described as mental retardation)"". i feel sick to my stomach knowing that i've been applying for jobs that i really want and i have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. i don't deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.


tldr: i've been checking the ""intellectual disability"" in applications to declare adhd when that actual means mental retardation. i've fucked up over a hundred job applications.",4
"by accidentally putting mentos and diet coke in my mouth at the same time in a foreign country. being half japanese, i take a trip to japan every two years with my dad to visit relatives, sightseeing etc. unfortunately i was never actually taught japanese so having my dad there with me is super useful when i need assistance. on our trips my dad usually takes a day to go hangout with his old friends (we live in the us) and usually leaves me at our hotel or whatever. today was one of those days. while laying in bed watching pewdiepie's minecraft videos i got quite hungry and thought to myself ""i can go down to the convenience store and get some snacks by myself right?"" normally, yes. so i take a couple thousand yen that my dad left me and walk to the nearest family mart (for those of you who don't know it's a japanese convenience store.) i browse the shelves a bit and up buying a bento meal, mentos, and a diet coke. checking out goes fine since i don't really need to communicate, just hand over money. so as i walk back to my hotel in the middle of a crowded sidewalk my dumbass decided to pop a few mentos in my mouth just because. so i suck on those for a while and than without even thinking about the consequences i take a huge swig of diet coke, like so big that i can't swallow all of it and it's just sitting in my mouth. than all of a sudden so feel a very weird foaming in my mouth. than it hits me. i remember the experiments i did in elementary school, the crazy russian hacker vids, etc. that was the very moment i knew i fucked up. so before i can think literally anything else it's foaming out of my mouth and i choke a little and end up just spewing out this diet coke foam. so obviously the people around me notice and come up to me and start speaking japanese. and of course i am sitting there, completely clueless. they were probably asking me if i needed help? i am dying of sheer embarrassment so i deadass just bolt back to my hotel with foam dripping down my face and clothes, im feeling sticky everywhere and life is not good. once i get back to my hotel room and start to settle in i remember that i left my actual food on the sidewalk. so i just ended up starving until my dad came home and brought some leftovers. 

tl;dr: i mixed mentos and diet coke into my mouth in front of a bunch of people who didn't speak the same language as me and sheer embarrassment ensued.",4
"by putting my dick in a year old fleshlight. i bought a fleshlight back in february of 2018, using it on and off again for about 3 months until i decided to box it up for good. i had had enough of the joy the toy brought me, and had just started a relationship with my now lovely girlfriend.

flash forward to yesterday, when i was looking through my old junk. i was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when i came upon the box. i smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. i put it aside for today, when i decided to use it. out of lube, i went it dry, fuck up #1. once i reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, i felt a tickling sensation. uneased i pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. to my surprise, and disgust, i was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. without thinking, i instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. in pain, i freaked out and let the spider get away.

my dick now hurts, and a spider is now loose in my house.

"(nsfw) by forgetting that my boyfriend creampied me last night and going to my gynecologist's appointment.. before everyone freaks out - yes, i am on birth control. also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.

this happened 30 minutes ago. i'm currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist's office typing this.

my boyfriend and i both lead pretty busy lives. he works full time and often works overnight shifts. on the other hand, i'm a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. on top of that, i had to put down my beloved fur child last saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my chamber of secrets..if you catch my drift.

after an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in conan o'brien's words, ""take grandma to applebee's."" it's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. as in, i felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. when i was cleaning myself up after, i noticed just how much was coming out of me and when i told him he laughs it off and says,"" haha, yeah, that was a lot.""

anyways, this morning i check my calendar and of course i have a gyno appointment. i'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, i completely forget about last nights sexscapade. 

fast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. i guess my gyno was training a physician's assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. 

for the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner sasha grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. they then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.

anyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. my experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,"" do you finally have a bf?"" (it's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, i must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, i wasn't sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). i awkwardly answer ""yes"" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. the new pa still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. that's the exact moment that my soul leaves my body. as she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, i see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter dripping off this thing into the floor. once the speculum was removed, i proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. yes, i was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. 

the poor pa looks at my gyno and asks,"" did you want me to clean that?,"" referring to what dripped on the floor. before he could answer, i made a strange ass sound and rushed out,"" it's okay, i'll do it.""

before they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,"" guess your dry spell is finally over!"" we speak casually like friends so i'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.

guys.. i am seriously fucking horrified. what the fuck. i'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. 

also, not using a throwaway because i have no shame.

tl;dr: boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.

edit: for those of you suggesting that this is an april fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. my dignity is in shambles but i'm glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.

also, yes, i did shower. my after-sex routine always involves a shower where i proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like i am a reborn christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. although a hefty amount did come out last night, apparently, not all of it. contrary to popular belief, cooter's are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there's a breeze. washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the inside which, if you're not dipping your 'nana into the nutella jar, is where the semen goes. a pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.

in my case, just like ~~noah~~ moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend's high fructose porn syrup. 

edit 2: for those that don't believe this is true.. or that i am female (grrls don't use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/twrhkgz

edit 3: for those that still don't believe me:

https://imgur.com/a/ymzjvjk

also, please don't speak badly about my gynecologist. you may think it's unprofessional but i've been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, i was single for 3 years and i'm not one to partake in one night stands) and we're really close. as part of a regular check up for std screening, he always asked if i have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, i'd say no then tell him how much i longed for a relationship. if this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have never acted like this. i have pcos/am high risk for cervical cancer so i am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/metformin/etc. (we're still working on a method to regulate my period). he's become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. it took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and i wouldn't change it for the world. though it'll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician especially a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that i view him as a friend. 

to clarify, bf and i had sex around 3am last night, i cleaned up, then we went to bed. today (or i guess yesterday since it's 12:33am right now), was my day off so i legitimately woke up and netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.

believe me or not, that's up to you. all i'm saying is i swear on my beloved fur baby's soul that it happened and i am still super embarrassed. in the years that i've been his patient, i have never seen this young female pa before. i do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, i can only guess. i'm sure she'll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. the pa gave me my pap smear and i had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my pcos anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, i'm sure we will redo the pap smear. my appointment was at 2pm but i was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. however, i'll be sure not to have piv sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as i genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where i am in a relationship ever).

i honestly was not expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. i never even really post on reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows i have this account *shrugs*. i guess this will become my ""throwaway"" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.

some of you are criticizing my writing style and that's okay. i decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. i also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as i could. sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. i appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.

it was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day. 

goodnight reddit!",4
"by turning my grandpa into a weeaboo.. my grandma died last year and grandpa's tken it hard. now he used to be the dirty old man sort of guy, so i thought getting him nekopara vol. 0 (a visual novel about catgirls) for christmas would be nice.

a few days ago, we met up at a wedding. i see my grandpa. he starts excitedly chatting with me about the game and i think, ""i did a good thing"" and tuned out the rambling.

i shouldn't have. we go back to my grandpa's place.

grandpa: here are the new decorations i have!

mom: dad, what is all this?

grandpa: stuff from the game your magnificent son gave me!

the whole apartment was littered with nekopara figurines, posters, merch and etc. he had a body pillow in his bedroom. now my family looks down on me for converting my grandpa into the weebiest of weebs.

i learned today through text he picked up eromanga sensei. god help his soul.

tl;dr: i gave my grandad a copy of nekopara. he went ape-shit and bought merch. my family now hates me for converting him into a degenerate.

"by sending a picture of the engagement ring to my girlfriend. tl;dr: accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.

&nbsp;

  so this was actually a few months ago. i (24m) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24f). i was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. 

&nbsp;

  so i put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. welp, it was immediately after clicking send that i noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. i looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: it was my gf. ""shit"" i said over the phone. my friend asked what was wrong, and i told him i'd have to call him back. tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.

&nbsp;

  as a last ditch effort, i called her, as the message did not yet say ""delivered"". she answered the phone and i immediately said ""do you see the message i just sent?"" ""yeah...it says attachment, why?"" immediately i blurted ""dont open it! just delete the thread. please."" 

&nbsp;

  she sounded concerned, and asked ""is this something i should be worried about? you're kinda scaring me lol"". ""no, no,"" i said, ""i just have a little surprise for you i was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise."" she relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. ""ok, i deleted it. didn't look at it."" i know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but i can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. the 1 or 2 times i ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. it's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).

&nbsp;

  so i had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now i had her highly suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. so i immediately went and found a cute little necklace on etsy i knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. later that week she got it and texted me, saying i was very sweet and she loved my surprise. phew. a few weeks later i actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected i was going to propose. despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her ""girls' day"" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.

&nbsp;

  when i told her about what that text really was and how i covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. she was impressed with how i improvised and threw her off track lol. we're getting married next october :)

"by having, what is hopefully, the strangest sexual experience i encounter. nsfw. literally happened a half hour ago.

husband and i have been together 15 years.  we are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.

he asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  i did.  unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  it was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.

i walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  he's not home 90% of the year because of work so i, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  i thought ""i'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls"".  

he's loving it.  i'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.

i feel something as i'm making circles with my tongue.  no big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so i quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  as i pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) i glance at it.  it's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  it took a half a second to realize that i had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.

"when my best mate changed his name in my phone to ""sexy jess from work"". so several years ago my best mate todd changed his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" and then would ring my phone in the middle of the niggt to try and get me in trouble with my partner. but she was friends with him before we had even gotten together so she recognized his number and his prank didnt really  work out.

fast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.
im sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.

que fuck up.
i never changed todds name back. its been a running joke between us for years.
so ""sexy jess from work"" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. she freaks out. comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams ""i hate you dad!"". she runs off upstairs.
so im sitting there really confused. after a few seconds i follow her upstairs. i can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.
now im really confused. i get to the bedroom. my partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from ""sexy jess from work"". i piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.

tldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" several years ago as a joke. today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.

sorry for formatting on mobile.


edit. wow this blew up.

so yes my daughter threw my phone at me. then picked it up and took it with her upstairs.

"by laughing at my son while he was saying his prayers. so, my 6 year old often likes to make up his own prayers at night time and it's adorable.  

so,  tonight,  he was kneeling at his bed in his jammies looking so cute i could just eat him.  


him: ""dear lord jesus, please watch over me as i sleep tonight. please look over mommy and daddy and teachers and friends too and the friends i haven't met yet. 

thank you for dinner and inventing minecraft ...""

*i chuckle lightly*

him: *turning to me angrily* ""it's not funny!!""

me: ""i'm sorry sweetie, i won't do it again""

him: *resuming his prayer* ""and please don't let my toys come alive tonight. amen""

and he hopped into bed. 

my stifled laugh sounded like a loud pig snorting, so i just layed my face down in his blankets and pretended like i was praying deeply as i tried to compose my self. 

then i got up quickly trying to hide my face, and i sneaked one last look to say good night as i shut the door and he was giving me the death glare. 



edit: thank you so much for the likes, comments,  gold and silver!  i really didn't think it was going to make it to the front page ! 

i actually thought it was going to get removed or downvoted because of our religion! i didn't realize so  many people have such hate towards people who believe in a higher power! 😥 it convinces me to keep teaching my son to love and to show respect to everyone no matter what they believe in. 

 i had a lot of fun reading everyone's comments.  they were very funny.  i am very thankful!😊😊

this is the cute little guy with his mama!

"by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina. 12 hours before my first ""grown up job"" interview, i was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company's grounds. considering i smoke weed daily i started looking up ways to pass a drug test. i came to the conclusion that i was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. i had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they're just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

unfortunately i was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time i had to prepare, but knowing that i wouldn't be able to pass if the temperature wasn't correct i had the idea to stick it up my vagina. i tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so i could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

fast forward to the interview.
it was an hour and a half away so i decided to wait till i got there to insert it. i did it in my car w some coconut oil before i walked in just incase they decided to drug test me first. i walked in and everything was fine, i signed in and they told me to take a seat. as soon as i sat down i knew something was wrong. i went to the bathroom to make sure i could still take it out. i began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn't move. i tugged again and the string broke. at this point i'm freaking out. i try getting it out with my fingers but i can't reach it. the only ""tools"" i have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. so in a 3 piece suit and heels, i squat and begin to use these ""tools"" to try and remove the bottle. about 4 min go by and i'm really freaking out but need to go back incase they called my name. i walk out and the hr rep sees me and asks if i'm okay. i tell her i have a tampon stuck up my vagina that i can't get out and that's why i'm freaking out. she then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, i ask her if i can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. obviously that didn't work. so she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... still didn't work. at this point i just have to do the interview. it lasted 3 hours and i had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

when the interview finally ends i rush to the closest urgent care where i have to explain to the doctors why there's a 5 hour energy in my vagina. at this point i'm convinced i just don't have the right tools and they'll get it out in no time. upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it's also sideways. her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle in my vagina and then fish it out. ~luckily~ they just sent me to the er instead. 

so now i'm at the er where they then inform me that since it's behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since i wasn't actually giving birth my body wasn't dilated and they couldn't remove the bottle without putting me under.  

well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.
i didn't get the job and i didn't even get drug tested. 

tldr: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. after 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the er it was finally removed

edit: this isn't made up. idk if i have all the ""anatomy"" right i guess? yes it was very painful. yes, i have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don't believe me

i'm just telling you guys what the doctors told me. they might have just told me a dumbed down version without the right medicinal terminology, idk

"by trying to remember what a customer looked like. the time has come. i've made it. i'm writing this from the break room shaking and humiliated. not only did this fu happen today, it happened within the last hour. i don't see my therapist again until friday, so you get to hear about it instead.

i work in a customer-facing position in a small office. today's just a regular monday. talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. at time being, i have three customers sitting in my waiting area.

the most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we'll call her jan, has been here before. or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it's my first time meeting her. the name on their account is hank junts and i feel like i've met him before. i *know* that i've met him before. i browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me i cannot place his face.

after about ten minutes of idle clicking, i decide to search his name on google with the name of our city.

>""beloved softball coach hank junts passes away in tragic fire."" 

headline from a local news station.

*oh my god. maybe that's why i've never met her before. maybe he always came in instead of her.*

the article is dated december of last year.

*jeeze, it probably has been that long since i've seen him, hasn't it. oh how tragic.* jan is probably only in her 40s or so. 

i wonder if i should say anything.

but i don't have to say anything. i would credit satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but satan never did anything so heinous.

**in tragic news, hank junts, softball coach at smith middle school, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**

at full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. i cannot catch it. the bird has knocked a vase onto mrs. junts' head. the bird has knocked me on my ass. there is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.

*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*

**no no no.**

i frantically scroll trying to find the video player. fuck. found it. pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.

*oh yeah, that's what he looks like.*

jan looks up at me. i look up at jan. the earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.

no, i'm not that lucky. i stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where i now sit red-faced and horrified. i can hear her on her cell phone. she is crying. i am crying. i fucked up and just ruined my customer's day and have a new addition to the file of horrible things to think about right as i fall asleep.

tldr: couldn't remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and i played it all of ten feet from his widow.

edit: okay i hate edits but now i understand why people do them. our faq of the day - no, my keyboard unfortunately does not have a volume button and i do try to keep my computer on mute. for what it's worth (i.e. not much at this fuckin point), the only reason it wasn't muted was because i was showing someone a coworker a video while we were opening. and yes, i probably shouldn't have done that either. 

there's a lot of love/hate about the bird thing. thank you for the compliments. if you said something mean i hope a real life non-metaphorical bird poops right on your head.

as far as what i'm going to do next. mrs. junts is coming back into the office next monday so i'm planning on talking to her in person then. thankfully i have a some days to practice because tbh, even though logically i know it was an innocent mistake, it still feels awful and it's hard to think about facing her. my coworker said she seemed okay when she left. and yes, i know that it was probably a mistake to run away but if i had any good judgement about any of this i wouldn't have a reason to post here in the first place.

so when all this went down, my sister and i asked my mom to take a dna test as well. she agreed. as it turns out, my mom is not my biological mom. as i said before, it makes no difference to me because my mom is my mom no matter what. 

here is the kicker though

my mom was wholeheartedly under the impression her eggs were used in her ivf treatment. she is contacting her doctor who is still in practice to figure out what the hell this means. 

i'm actually sort of sad for my mom, i didn't consider this as an option in the realm of possibility. we are her daughters of course but i can't imagine finding out at her age with adult kids that your biological line actually ends with you. 

so yeah, guess that's all i have for now!

tldr; mom is not my mom and she is more shocked than i am. 

edit: i talked to my mom this morning and she's ok, thank goodness. she said we're still her babies! i discussed the idea of hiring a lawyer with her, she said she still has her ivf paperwork somewhere so she is looking for it. her paper hoarding may come in handy this once! i'm just happy she is alright.",4
"by letting my nephew use my deceased brother cell phone. this happened yesterday. my brother passed away in an accident a few months ago, he was only 35. needless to say, it was - and still is - a huge trauma to all of us. my 6 years old nephew wanted to play a game in my brother´s (his father) phone, sister-in-law was ok with it, so i let him. all of the sudden, i hear him doing a monologue... went to check up on him. he was clicking on family member´s pictures and making calls. a few moments later, people started to message me saying they almost had a heart attack. some didn´t have the balls to answer... my sister had to leave a work meeting because she started to shake. they were scared. they were surprised. the best was people´s description of the moment they picked up the phone and saw my brother´s name on the screen, thinking he was calling from the beyond. we all had a good laugh.

mandatory edit:

thank you for the gold.


thank you for the condolences.


my brother´s phone line is still active, it´s in a family plan...  i won't be pestering my sister-in-law about this, she is having a hard time already and if this isn´t a issue for her, i sure won´t create one.  

tl;dr: family freaked out thinking my deceased brother was calling them, instead it was my nephew using his phone.  ",4
"by playing a joke on a colleague who took it seriously. i ended up losing a vacation day and got a disciplinary action in my file.. i worked for a workman's compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - todd - who was mildly annoying.  nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  he enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. it got to be enough, so i decided he needed some payback.

he paid out a claim that was huge and he was nervous about it. i don't know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so i waited. about a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but todd), i said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.

a couple of days after that, i stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, ""did you payout x-amount on the smith file?"" he said he had and asked me why. i just walked away.

the following monday, i had my plan laid out fairly well.  after sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that i borrow his black surplus impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. then, early that morning, i went about putting crime scene tape across the door to todd's his office.

i had the receptionist in on it too. when todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.

todd made it to the top of the steps when i rushed up to him and said, ""dude - go, just go!""

""what the hell are you talking about?"" he asked.

""just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!""

he shrugged me off, but i could tell that he was a little rattled. he turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. he walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. he ended up slipping out through the stairwell.

he was gone for nine hours. i had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.

his absence meant that management got involved. i had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. i got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and i lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.

todd doesn't tape my mouse anymore.


tl;dr  i played a practical joke on a colleague and he took it seriously


*edit:  i posted this thinking it might be amusing to a few of you and i wasn't expecting much of a response from it.  i have to say, i've enjoyed the pissy posts the most, the ones saying i went too far.  yes i did, which is why this was a fu.  for any of you worried about todd, he's fine.  this actually happened in 1993 and i posted it because todd and i were remembering it recently (and laughing) and so i had it on my mind.  yes, i still work with him (a different company now) and we've been friends for almost 25 years.*",4
"when i read my mom's recipes. throwaway because there's just no way i'm immortalizing this shit on my actual reddit account. 

this morning my mom messaged me to ask if i could come over and update the antivirus software on her pc. i agreed to drop in when i'm done working.

fast forward to me appearing in front of my mom's computer, initiating the update process, and proceeding to do nothing but stare at the progress bar. while i was doing that, my mom proceeded to prepare dinner. 

the update was taking forever so i decided to kill time by bringing necessary order to my mom's desktop. it was a mess. dozens of random folders scattered across the screen in no particular order whatsoever. i couldn't even see the fucking wallpaper. it was enough to summon the ocdemon buried inside of me and clean up the clutter. 

so, as i was organizing my mom's shit, i noticed a folder called ""mom's recipes"". now, as a guy who's dating a girl who loves a man who can cook, this folder peaked my interest. i figured it wouldn't hurt skimming over some of my mom's recipes and perhaps surprising the girlfriend with an unexpected home cooked meal.

i opened the recipe folder and clicked on the word document inside. now, i'll be honest, i'm not the world's most intelligent person, but when i see the words ""mom"" and ""recipes"", i imagine wholesome family dinners and shit. not...

""i'm a woman, i'm a widow, i'm a mother, i'm over 50, and i'm still the whore next door""

this was the fucking opening line to my mom's so called ""recipes"". it was an ominous sign that i should not read any fucking further. i read further. it became clear to me my mom's recipes had nothing to do with how to cook, but rather how to fuck. i made it through the first two pages before the ""recipe book"" went into graphic detail about what my mom's preferences were when it comes to size of the dick going into her mouth and vagina versus the size of the dick going into her ass. 

i closed the document, finished the update, and got the fuck away from that computer. my mom invited me stay for dinner but i declined. all i could see was different sized dicks entering my mother everywhere. i think i need to end our relationship now. 

tl;dr read my mom's recipes and realized her favorite ingredient is cock.",4
"by asking too much from my gf's mom. this actually happened today.

so my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. she lives up in ohio and we reside in florida. well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

the last time she visited, she saw an old wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the wii tennis game. i always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

now to the fuck up.

i thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working wii and wii sports game for the next time she visits.

so i text her: 

me: hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?

her: what's that?

me: bowl me! if you think you stand a chance. >:)

her: excuse me?

me: you heard me, lol.

so 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.

i never said ""bowl me"" oh no dear reddit, i wrote ""blow me""

luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

tl;dr: got wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of bowl me.",4
"by ordering underwear off of amazon.. 

not a fuck up that just happened, but one that i just realized happened. 

this christmas season, and like the last few, i did almost at all of my shopping via amazon. for friends and family that live far away i had their gifts shipped right to their house.

after spending more that i should this holiday season i haven't felt the need to buy anything until last week. i remembered i had a $50 amazon gift card, and decided to get myself more boxer briefs and black long sleeve undershirts. i ended up with around $70 (puma performance boxer briefs are super comfy) in my cart. a few quick clicks and one confirmation email let me know my order went through. 

like i said that was last week. but as of today the package still hadn't gotten here. so i checked my order and it says that it arrived. i was pissed. i had issues with delivery in the past. but i live in a small apartment building and i didn't think anyone would take my boxes. 

and then i noticed the address it shipped to. apparently amazon auto filled in the last address i used:

 my reddit secret santa. 

so one of you guys out there got a random shipment of underwear. if you could return them  pm me. i'd appreciate it. otherwise enjoy some comfy boxer briefs.

tl;dr my secret santa got a surprise gift.",4
"by farting during mass and making the priest laugh. this actually happened about an hour ago. i'm just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.

so...i'm sitting at mass listening to the reading when i feel a slight grumble in my stomach,

""uh oh...gas.""

no biggie, this has happened before, i'll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. but alas, my body had other plans.

we stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, i'm starting to panic, not sure if i can hold it. we finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as i land on the pew...

it happened!

now this wasn't a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. it created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as gabriel's trumpet.

the church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, i looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. at this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...

the priest stands up at his chair, says ""i'm sorry...i'm sorry...i can't..."" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, i can hear him laughing.

at this point i decide it's a total loss, i shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.

tl;dr  farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now i gotta find another church. ",4
"by letting my wife into the bathroom while i was taking a shower. so we had just finished having a wholesome breakfast of eggs, potatoes and cinnabread my wife made and i hopped into the shower. when i shower i listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. i'm a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn't. after she finished she asked to come into the shower, but i was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes i'm a guy, i just don't like body hair) and told her no because i had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder's width stall. she said fine and walked away. shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and i hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. this is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as ""top 3 minecraft songs"" and ""3 hours of farting."" sure enough, she'd stolen my phone. i got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. this behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before i was finally able to get my phone back.

edit: first time using reddit, color me impressed. i did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! this is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that i've left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. her go-to video is '3 hours of farting' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. i am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and i'm very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who've pointed that out. for those of you 
asking, shower sex was not an option. our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you'd find in the changing rooms at your local beach. we've done shower sex before, it's a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.

"by ejaculating in my bed. throwaway obviously. this is a few months old but i feel like i have to get it out of my head.

so i know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but i've always done it in bed. i am living with my parents so i guess i just like the privacy of my room. then - and this is what i now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time i would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. i never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so i just kept doing it because it was easy... nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

after some years of doing this i recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. i used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks i started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. this usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since i was always ejaculating on my wall/bed i began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

i didn't notice at first and since i've never had cockroaches before i didn't really know what they were but eventually i read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... at first i felt really disgusted. i wanted to exterminate them but i definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so i tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. but then i felt really bad.



i don't know why but it felt like murder. i didn't really dislike the cockroaches. i had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. so i decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point i finally began masturbating in the shower). i know this sounds really weird but i kind of began thinking of them as my children. it started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. i actually want kids when i grow up. and this was kind of like that - i used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and i just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



then my parents found out. i think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while i was at school. 



so we had to move out for about a week to an airbnb and i was really depressed the entire time but i couldn't tell them why. they thought i just didn't like the airbnb.

tl;dr i jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation",4
"by toothpasting in the nude. this actually happened today and i'm still feeling the consequences. ..

while standing in the nude, waiting for the shower to warm up this morning i decided to try that toothpaste dance the kids do in the stands at hockey games. i was getting into quite the rhythm, doing really well and moving pretty fast. it felt invigorating... i noticed something was just a little off however, and started to make adjustments to try and figure it out. turns out i had my hands open and flat and you're supposed to have them in fists. well, i made fists and it looked perfect for a moment until i proceeded to punch the life out of my dick as it was flapping back and forth due to the motion of my hips.  i immediately bent over, smacked my face on the bathroom counter and fell to the floor. now i'm sitting here at work with a sore dick and forehead, feeling like a fool.

"by leaving my facial cleansing brush in my boyfriend's parents bathroom. this happened 2 weeks ago and i've only just stopped cringing entirely when i think about it.

my boyfriend and i were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. i took a shower, and i remember feeling really smug because i remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. for anyone that doesn't know what it is, it's literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. 

after using it, i wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when i had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. it's important to note that i had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the 'head' of it.

anyway, everything's fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and i are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for ""a word"" with my boyfriend. we both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.

after a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says ""why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?""  obviously i was perplexed, saying i really had no idea what he was talking about. he was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as ""pink with a big bulb"" and then it hit me.

i too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as i explained what it was. unfortunately, i didn't realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. 

""you don't have to lie bloatedrabbit, it's ok but just next time don't leave it around for everyone to see.""

""i swear on my life it's a face cleanser!"" i said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. i handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. my boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he's a dirty old man for thinking like that. his dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when i think about it.

""well i'm sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother's toys!"" 


i'm not religious at all, but when i say i wanted god to beam me up there and then... i'm not kidding. i felt like jumping out the window. the whole energy of the room shifted. his dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn't dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.

worst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. my boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. talk about awkward.

tl;dr i left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend's conservative parents bathroom. his dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend's mum's toys.",4
"accidentally watching a black mirror episode with audio description on. not today, but black mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and i just remembered my fuck up. 

said episode was ""shut up and dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

now, i don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. so the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and i definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. but of course, the black mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

i think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. we were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

well, the end was near, and came the twist. normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. we were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? and to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

we were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as black mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. after some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.

"by going jogging - i'm bloody and afraid to go this route again.. unlike most posts, this happened just half an hour ago. 

i'm a 21 year-old male. i was out running my 2 miles. headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. i round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and i see this big black duck looking at me. as i get closer, i think to myself, ""man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" i keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. so i stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. this bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

i'm thinking to myself, ""what the fuck?"" so i'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and i keep running think he will leave me alone. i start running again and the faster i run, the faster he chases me. i start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. i'm thinking, ""i've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, i don't need this shit"" so i stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. in all my years of being a person, i've never trained for this.

this little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. he starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as i'm trying to run backwards away from him. we've covered a quarter mile at this point. i try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. i'm thinking, ""how the fuck am i gonna explain this if i have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? i'm a grown ass man. this is bullshit.""

i try running again and he keeps flying after me. i'm at a loss. i don't know what to do at this point. i'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. am i really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? like, i don't want to, but i might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? seriously?"" we have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. he bites me again and i drop my phone. i pick it up quickly. who do i call? i've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. while i'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, i hear a noise; someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

this was a big mistake. the duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. i saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. i feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. the last i saw of him was the look i took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake i did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

i cannot make this shit up. i would have recorded it, and i tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

this is bullshit. i'm covered in cuts and bites. most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something i was not ready for.

tl;dr i'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. i'm covered in blood.

"by giving my 19 year old puggle the fat off my t-bone steak. this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. 

on mobile so forgive me for my sins. 

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause i'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, i was cleaning my t-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. i thought, ""man, buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so i proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. i proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (quickly for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so i didn't expect this, but i suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. i'm watching him eat it cause i'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk irishman.   i instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so i grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. i'm freaking the fuck out. so i start giving him cpr. (i don't know how to do cpr for humans, let alone a dog, but i gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day i die. he lays there for a second & i rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug i gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat i ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. i monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. i gave him some love & he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. 

tl;dr i brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.

"by trying to inflate my penis like a dick balloon.. this fuck up took place 15 years ago when i was around 11 years old.   i had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  it got me thinking about how small my penis was.    i decided i needed to do something about this.   i did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  i however knew that i had a penis, which had a hole, and i had a pump.   the pump i had, was a soccer ball pump.   the ones with the little metal needle.  well i examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   i stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   i decided the pain would be worth it.   i pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   it inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   since i was 11, i was not an anatomy expert.   the sensation gave me an erection, so i decided it must be working.  i inflated again.   it hurt a little this time, and now it felt like i had to pee.   i wanted results though, and people always say ""no pain, no game.""   i pushed the handle down again.   now i really fucking had to pee.

i removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   the sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   however, i really fucking had to pee.   i pushed super hard.   no man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  i get to claim that i guess.   the air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   it really hurt my dickhole.   amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    i can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when i pee occasionally.  i am considering going to a urologist one day, however i am not sure how to address the issue.   the last thing i would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

tldr:   i thought my penis was too small so i inflated it like a balloon.    it hurt when i peed.

"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics.. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

evil is evil. stop blocking breaking news.






edit: i would like to clarify. 
i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

i am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, i had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as notre dame or new zealand massacres. 

i don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case muslims. it could have been extremist christians and i would say the same thing about them. 

humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. stop the violence and protect the planet. why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",6
"amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail see below. edit: thanks for the awards. i hope this post can raise some awareness.

in a speech schumer gave(https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  ms. foundation for women's gloria awards and gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""and then came the sex, and i use that word very loosely. his penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. in this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urhxqrq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. the host says ""so you raped a guy"" at 11:12(https://youtu.be/8urhxqrq2_4?t=670) and amy replies ""yeah i know. when i tell this story i say i let a cab driver finger me but really i took his hand...\sic\"". if the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this twice, he'd be in jail after public outrage. why the double standards. amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist.",6
"pedophiles who are trying to get help are brave.. it takes a lot of balls to admit that you're attracted to children. if they are trying to get help, they shouldn't be attacked by people for being a bad person. a pedophile is not a bad person until they actually commit an offence.",6
"if the father of your child is still active in their life and paying child support, you're not a single mother, you're a single woman.. i think people make a big deal about how hard it is to be a single parent when they have joint custody, their ex wants to be in their child's life, and they receive  child support and/or alimony, even though the only thing that's different between them and me is that someone sleeps in my bed at night.

eta: i didn't think this would get so much response. but since everyone is in my inbox making assumptions, let me clarify and say that a really quick internet search would have shown you i'm a 30 year old white married woman with kids 🤷🏻‍♀️ not a bitter dude who pays child support. calm down.

"being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but i don't have a rally cry of support behind me. my ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. i have none of that. its not that my friends don't think i'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. what about single dads?  we do the same shit. i work and take care of my kids the same way but i don't get celebrated like i'm doing something amazing. i just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous. like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids. like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

social media has like minded individuals the opportunity to find each other and create a larger voice. we act like we're living in a world where the average person is this upset by everything snowflake when it reality the average person is as sick of it as everyone else. i mean how many of you have actually met one of these people? because i only hear about people getting upset with things like ""baby it's cold outside"" ",6
"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl. i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6

that is the work of a predator. maybe it isn't as bad as bill cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. cardi b should not be a celebrated public figure.

as a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. if you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less.

"young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are ... acting completely reasonable.. there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

if you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. it's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. there just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. young men don't owe society anything. we should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

"""ok boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.. facts:

•	millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did—despite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

•	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

i feel like telling people (politely) when they've used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying ""language is fluid"" isn't appropriate for such a serious mistake. i think it's fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong ""there"" actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used.

"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?. they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6
"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",6
"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant. i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant. every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

"preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money. every fucking time i buy a frozen pizza, i put that sassy bitch in right when i start the oven. why? because i've figured it out. that's right uncle sam, i'm onto you. 

the directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425f and cook for 15 minutes. my oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. so, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? no way. not chance in hell, buckaroo. when i shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, i add 3-4 minutes to compensate. this means i wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. and guess what? it tastes fucking delicious. ask any of my friends. i cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can't get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. the pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. source: i've been doing this for 12 years.

so nice try, mr. president. i know you want all of us to cook our pizzas for that extra 10 minutes to make us use a little extra electricity. maybe it isn't significant if one person cooks their frozen italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you're a thinker. you're looking at the grand  scheme of things. millions of people cooking their pizza for 10 minutes extra? that's straight theft, my man. and i ain't giving in to that scheme .",6

i'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely ""oof"", ""yikes"", and ""le"" (""doggo"" and ""pupper"" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). expanding on what i said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. it's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",6

"defaming a historical figure for their ""blatant racism"" is stupid. if you were around during the 19th century, you'd be just as racist as anyone else.. so much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. no shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. it's just how things were. despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

note: this post inspired by a twitter rant about hp lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. get over it.

edit: my inbox hurts. thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. also, i get it, lovecraft was *particularly* racist. still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. separate the art from the artist.

"we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.. i get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and i am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  i agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  why is that?  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  is it that no one in hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

disclaimer - i know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  i don't debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. not only respect, but gratitude.  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. but still...

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

"traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven't traveled. i've traveled everywhere. the uk, germany, france, india, bangladesh, about half of the us (including california, las vegas, new york, minneapolis, tennessee, hawaii, you get the idea) 

not once have i ever felt ""yeah, i'm experiencing something i couldn't back at home""

when you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

i've hiked on mountains, i've swam in oceans, ive been on the london eye, i've run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have i felt ""yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away""

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

yes i'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to bumble, and it's not as bad as something like hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. while this is about tinder's new settings, i think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

in fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange coke (which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them).

"reddit gold is fucking stupid. i mean really, who would actually pay real life money just to say they liked a post a bit more than average? same goes for reddit silver/platinum, the fact that some people actually pay to give these to someone is just astonishing.

edit: no i did not make this post to get gold from people, this subreddit is for unpopular opinions so i posted what i consider to be an unpopular opinion.

edit 2: i honestly don't know whether i should be happy or disappointed about the gold i got

edit 3: i don't hate reddit gold. i think it's stupid and i don't care for it. people calling me a hypocrite for not taking this post down after i got all this gold don't get my point. gold makes no difference to the way i experience reddit, so i have no reason to care about it.",6
"small penis jokes count as a body shaming and are harmful.. i am a female, but i still dislike how acceptable it is to make jokes about small penises or degrade other people by saying ""they must be compensating"" and what not. i think it's harmful and should be just as frowned upon as other types of body shaming.",6
"whether 18 or 40, women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison, just like when its men doing the same thing.. https://preview.redd.it/zapcm4pe97c21.jpg?width=426&auto=webp&s=5da2b71aa1fd7350e23e933a19a84b7133b96a68

the double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/em28yfrmdfi?t=9

here's a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

there's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

neither is acceptable. the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period. if there were a progressive victim stack, males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay.

edit: jfc this blew up. 

#edit 2: omg thanks for the gold guys, i really appreciate it! omg i also got gilding! thank you stranger. i am so blessed. i love you!

edit 3: google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". i dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. claiming i'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually worse because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

for anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

>i live in aus and about 11 years ago i used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with america, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the us for one summer. she went over there an had an inappropriate 'romance' with a camp attendee. he was 15 and she was 20. the boys parents found out and had her charged. she went to a women's prison in iowa. her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the us to try and get her sent back home. she is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. she is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. she is banned from ever travelling to the us. imo she got what she deserved.

"a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer. a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. i think it is.

furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

ps: i am not defending drug dealing, i am just comparing it to teachers.

"alcohol is overrated and drinking in general is not that fun.. i personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me i personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. i never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am i missing something ?

and before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends i doubt that since i have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. hes probably part of the reason i dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something i couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.

"the death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.. generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. frankly, i believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

the child leaves almost nothing behind. it's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   on the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. they had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

i don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking i think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

- i'm not saying the death of a child is worthless. to those who told me i should kill myself because i'm advocating the death of children (?), just know that you can't even fucking read
- of course  it depends on the situation, that's why a put ""generally"".
- it's not a competition but it doesn't mean things can't be discussed 
- english is not my first language, so if you think my grammar is shit i'm sorry but couldn't care less.

so as long as a woman is able to keep up a lie for several years, she should be able to trap any man to be a dad to her kids?

it appears as though companies can do what they want to the ""little people"" as long as the right peoples pockets are being lined, nothing seems to have any regulation and no one who can do anything about it seems to care. 

what's worse is a lot of americans seem blind to this, they've been raised to see it as normal. they talk about how they are free and america is great but from my point of view it they're spewing nothing different from the propaganda force fed to the people of communist countries.

"alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does.. alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. it slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

there is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly.

**1,153.** that's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per the washington post.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) this averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - terrorism.** let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016. this is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. source(https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - falling.** whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 us lives in 2011. the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury. so why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   source(https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - diabetes.** if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. source(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

and, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **airplane/spacecraft crash** \- 26 deaths
* **drowning in the bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **getting struck by a projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **pedestrian getting nailed by a lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **accidentally strangling yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200b;

now, here's a new york times article(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*new reality for high school students: calculating the risk of getting shot.*"" complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? what it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the washington post:(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>that means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. and since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. the chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200b;

in percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. it's a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",6

"trying to force someone into atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into christianity.. i am one of those atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. i would honestly rather just let people be. i don't think i am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. i have been seeing several threads on reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. albert einstein was a jew, does being an atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? no.

and it also makes me cringe when atheists try to force religious people into atheism. if we are going to strongly condemn christians trying to force others into christianity, we should condemn atheists trying to force atheism on to other people.

if it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

edit: thanks for bringing einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically jewish, growing up in a jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. that being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. isaac newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) christian. if you don't want to use scientists as an example, james madison, who wrote the bill of rights that is idolized by many, was also christian. the conclusion i am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",6

"there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women.. perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but i'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot. (i've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

i don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. my size isn't great either but i've come to accept it, however, i know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

when i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, i laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. a man can't. a woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

the rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. while it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

edit: as an addendum, i'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

all i can say is fuck most of you. you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. even though i accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do. i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever i'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. i'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**edit 2: i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

i didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. i'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

firstly i'd like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women. i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont. i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. my problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

i understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. no one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **i never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) i simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. but from where i'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault. and before anyone addresses it, i'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and i used penis size as an example. what i really want is inclusivity. of everyone. 

another topic i'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" while i understand the logic, i dont really see how its productive. sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. many of us crave it, strive for it. make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. i understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. which is why i'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. and i agree with that, but all i'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

i obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but i believe i'm a bit of an idealist. for better or worse, i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that. i admit i'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why i dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. many suggested that i should start the movement myself, but i'm simply not the right person for the job. i'm hot headed, i sometimes don't think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. i'm a private person, despite how i am online with anonymity, in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. perhaps rightly so, because i'm a bit of a dick. but love me or hate me, i stand by most of what i said. 

i sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. supporting one particular group. (culturally speaking i'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) i care about people despite what many of you may believe. and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

the last major point i'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. i'll admit that sure, i wish i had a bigger dick. i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it. i've had partners who didn't care and i genuinely believe them. i know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

one last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion. there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didn't address here, and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself. and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",6

"if we should blame anyone for the lack of action on climate change, it should be greenpeace.. because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

because of their crusade on gmos, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

and because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a unesco heritage site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against ddt.

they personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. they have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. they are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

edit #1: a slight correction on the ddt point. it was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. it was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. however, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that ddt is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

"if your are ""literally shaking"" from the recent national tragedies, but you have no direct affiliation with the victims, you need to get over yourself.. i have seen a few overly dramatic people on twitter and reddit going on about how they are ""literally shaking"" from the recent spree of mass shooting attacks.

while those attacks are worth a long in depth civil discussion by itself, if you aren't directly affiliated with the victims, you need to get a grip with yourself and stop making everything about you.

like you are taking national tragedies, and making it about yourself. if it bothers you that much, get off your ass and speak to your local lawmakers.

it just really annoys the shit out of me. like i may like guns, but at least i respect anyone calling for action against guns. that's action. you're voicing a stance, and that's good. 

you saying ""omg, i'm literally shaking"" is just fucking worthless reaction to tell anyone.

very classy. you're mad about me saying anything about these attacks, but you realize the recent orlando attack was a gay nightclub, right? is that irony lost on you when calling me a ""faggot""? 

otherwise, thank you for the mostly civil discussion, even if you really disagree with me. only a few people grossly misunderstood me. i also do have empathy for innocent people getting slaughtered minding their own business, but i don't have room for people seeking attention over something that has little to do with them.

"swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.. when you swim in denim jeans it's like you're an armored aquatic creature. the way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. i personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. they (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they're soaking wet. 

also, when your jeans are soaked, they're heavier. it's always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

if you haven't tried swimming in baggy jeans i suggest doing so. it will change your life.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men. it's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. and a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

and if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. its ludicrous.

tl;dr: women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. this is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. sorry this was so long.

edit: okay obviously i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things. 

1. this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, i think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. it starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",6

\- the other thing is: i have to admit that this post was rushed. and yes, i am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive. i don't regret what i wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. that's right. and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw i'm female for those who thought otherwise). the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). and at the end i'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. i should have considered more factors. i want to apologize about that honestly. so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now i'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. i'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. so thank you for offering the experience. i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. i'll try and digest them properly in the following days. i'm still think that i'm right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless. i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**content:**

honesty is not kindness. honesty is honesty. period. i don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. if you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. and yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

you can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is your responsibility. the partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. i wonder why it's so sensitive…

eta: like i said in a reply to a commenter, sure its a ""nice thing to do"" and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it's a nice gesture all around, but disabled people aren't mindless angel pets. they have brains and lots of them don't like to feel pitied or patronized. especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. i'm not saying ""don't ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives"" i am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. also if you're gonna do something nice for someone make sure you're being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. don't be nice one day and then cruel the next. i know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that's not my main issue here. the motive isn't the issue either, it's the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. instead of mistreating someone, doing one ""nice"" thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. my issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. i really don't give that much of a shit about ""prom queen"" or shit like that anyway, i'm using it as an example. i'm almost 20 years old and when i was younger i never ran for those positions anyhow. another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. that way he won't feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. make him feel like he's not a helpless invalid.",6

"in general, women are grosser than men.. i'm a woman. here's my reasoning.

i worked janitorial jobs for almost 10 years, in various settings. banks, doctor's offices, businesses, gas stations, etc. the women's restroom was always, 100% of the time, nastier. things in the toilet i can't even begin to describe. toilet paper everywhere. poop on the walls and the seats. spit and make up on the mirrors. and blood on everything. all the time.

in ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing i saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. i worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. and had money, and the women destroyed their bathrooms. sometimes i wasn't even sure the things i saw, came out of humans.

secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms i've been in, were women's. in female friends homes i've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

i've never seen worse than dirty clothes on a man's bedroom floor.

"there were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today.. this came up while discussing movies with my sister. i asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. she said something like ""i'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good and female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

the current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like wonder woman being exceptions). i found terminator, power rangers, castle, etc. way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them. also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. now, with a separate chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. but i'm digressing.

power rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point. females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers. they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. that. was. awesome. the new ghostbusters isn't. 

now i'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

edit: to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, i'm not making this up. women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. although this was challenged by judit and now by hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",6

"american colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.. according to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. in america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


in those 8 years of school, i must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. there are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and i hate using this term) a sheep. to my understanding, american colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (not 100% sure on that) so, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


edit: ok, i understand and agree that philosophy is important. however, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. hell, my school has bio ethics, i haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant.

all they know is that on a regular basis the most important person in their life, their owner, is taking them to a strange, smelly, terrifying torture arena. they are stabbed, poked, prodded and their veins are filled with poison. the next thing they know they have gone from terrified to nauseated, fatigued and just feeling like absolute shit. and you, their human, are doing it for what? to squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

so, it has come to my attention that i was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. for more information on pets and chemo i went to this site, seems reliable(https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

in keeping with the spirit of this sub i'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""if your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

i know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. the reason i think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, especially in instances when the animal is suffering.

"instagram is ruining everything (a rant). i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. let me explain:

1. **ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. no political or important dialogue is happening. i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something.
2. **ig is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **ig is bad for your mental health.** because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in ig. this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (see also this article: http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/(http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **ig makes people vain.** taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. it's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **ig gives the worst incentives to people.** the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka)). they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. this shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. now i don't think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

i would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. so just to clarify, i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. however, i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",6

edit: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why i care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. fat is fat. not curvy, just fat. there are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on youtube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). i simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations. but hey, if calling me insecure/a bitch makes you feel better, go ahead :) ",6
people who drive 15-20 mph under speed limit and brake check anyone they think is too close are more dangerous than speeders and tailgaters and should be punished more.. there's nothing worse than driving 40 mph on the interstate/highway or someone brake checking the car in front of me. people who do this tend to be unpredictable and disrupt traffics in other ways such as late merge or not paying attention in duel turn lanes. whereas people speeding or tailgating just want to go faster rather than because they are oblivious to their surroundings.,6
"it's fine to not like kids, but constantly talking about how much you hate them is just you being an asshole.. seriously. like i get it, kids can be gross and annoying and stressful. it's fine to not like them, it's fine to not want to be around them, and it's certainly fine to not want to have them.

what some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. even if you're not saying it to their face, even if they're too young to even understand you — you're just an asshole. 

also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. they have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. they are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. and just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

i'm just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren't people yet, like they're less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. it's so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.


edit: okay i need to clarify some stuff. i'm usually just a lurker on reddit, i'm not used to all this attention and i'm not completely sure how to deal with it.

i think people who shove their pro kid opinions down people's throat are down right awful. people have every right in the world to not want kids and as i've mentioned in the comments, i totally get why so many people hate kids. you're allowed to hate them! they can be nasty, annoying, mean, etc. in this post i was trying to express how people who treat children like they are subhuman are assholes. i'm not trying to insult anyone's lifestyle.

also, i deleted all the edits thanking the people who gave me awards because someone commented that it was annoying and i realized i wholeheartedly agree haha. sorry about that! like i said, i'm not used to my posts getting attention.

"acne can actually make a person more attractive.. i have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. however, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? i'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. to clarify, i am not talking about severe cystic acne. painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. but people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. this kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. i can't really put my finger on it. it would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. and even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

well this has never happened before. it's been kind of hilarious to read these comments going from: ""you're an absolutely disgusting vile human being"" to ""i 100% agree with you"". i'm also surprised at how unpopular this opinion really is! but i guess i put it in the right place lol. i'm not sure people should be thanking me either. i can be quite shallow as well. this is just one those subjective quirks i really enjoy and thought needed to be pointed out. but really if you read the comments some of the things you guys are into is pretty unconventional. beyond all these superficial traits though, i think the biggest thing to remember is that sometimes love just happens to you. you don't get to choose it. so stop worrying about who you're gonna pick. and as a the great redditor u/chief_economist once said: sit down, be humble. or was that kendrick lamar? anyway.",6

many stories in there about hints girls dropped for guys. some of them i read and think, ""i could see someone doing this in a truly platonic way.""

personally, i have an experience i think about often. a coworker (girl) invited me over to get drunk on tequila and sleepover. when it came time to go to bed, i asked where i should sleep and she said ""well you can sleep on the couch or you can come to the bed with me.""

i elected for the bed.

however i wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so i didn't initiate anything and she didn't either. to this day i still don't know if it was a missed opportunity or a correct interpretation.

my opinion: is it really ""missed hints,"" or is it ""fear of misinterpreting and violating someone?""",6
"the reason a lot of subreddits are moderated terribly is because normal, mentally healthy people don't have the time to moderate internet forums for free.. all these ""power mods"" that moderate multiple big communities do so because they don't have a life. removing posts and comments they don't agree with is all they have going for them. i just feel bad that nobody loves them so they have to come here and gain some fake sense of authority by silencing people that don't live in their mother's basement.edit: got a message saying i had to add more to the post, so here it is:

i was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. i understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/nottheonion, r/tifu, r/eli5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

there aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. the admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda.

"""you can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea..  let me preface this by saying i do believe in being grateful for what you have. but there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. i hate this for several reasons.

1. the people who say this almost never have it worse. they are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. i have a disability that limits my ability to walk. i don't complain about it much but i've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. i'm aware of that, but i've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. by the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. complaining solves problems. now, i can't speak for everyone with a disability, but i personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. in fact, i'm probably the best person you can complain to. i've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and i grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, i might be able to help. 

4. also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. so even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. look it up.

5. those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if i do it right. after all, isn't that what protesting is? complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. it's used to silence people who need help. i don't think i need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. it's human nature to complain. it just is.

"we need to let some pet breeds die out.. we have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

of course i don't mean all breeds of animals when i say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds i do mean:

french bulldogs, pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: these dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

munchkin cats: munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. if they had no health risks, i still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. but, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (hollowed chest), and lordosis (curved spine).

this isn't even hard to achieve. simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

but i doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

"the problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them.. negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

this happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

this is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

i've seen people who live in cardboard houses not accepting any form of birth control cause ""that's not what god would want"" and having 6 to 10 children (i'm not even kidding) living in poor conditions and 0 opportunities, and getting to their teenage years only to start that cycle again and again. and no one does anything because is their ""right"" to have children.",6
"assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist. basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
but:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc 
-> fixing the person's problems

if after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

a much needed edit:
- the time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way
- the free aspect seems to irritate some people who don't want to fund it with their tax, how about funding it with the taxes from rich people/corporations instead?

maybe she just wants to warn a guy before wasting their time with meeting up somewhere, or stop them from getting their hopes up. i get that too. 

however, if a man were to say  ""sorry, no (blank)  women"", they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

it's a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. whereas someone would say of the woman ""oh, she's just very selective and knows what she wants"", they would say of the man ""what a pig! how dare he!"". no one would ever say ""he's just very selective and wants to find the perfect soul mate"".

"marriage between 2 people isn't ""unnatural"" or ""outdated,"" people just don't want to accept the fact that all relationships take hard work, commitment, and sacrifice.. you've probably heard the statistic that half of all marriages in the u.s. end in divorce. you've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
this is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. the reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of disney fairytale. what a joke. but this is really ingrained in our culture. think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

&#x200b;

the fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. they take commitment. they take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

what does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*it means... not scrolling through the facebook or ig pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if i was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*it means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""she/he was mean to me."" ""i deserve this."" ""she doesnt love me anyway. i can sleep with someone else now."" - nope. you made a commitment. stick by it and work on your issues.

\*it means... putting down the video games, the tv controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*it means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&#x200b;

these are just a few examples of things i see so often that kill marriages. the truth is that marriage between 2 people can be amazing and last a lifetime, but you have to work hard at it and ignore a lot of what our selfish, hyper-consumer culture tells us about how to behave.",6

"john lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.. he was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  lennon resented his son julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. after lennon divorced his wife, he took off with yoko ono and dropped out of his son's life for years. julian has stated that paul mccartney was far more of a father to him than john ever was. 

john was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. he often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. he claimed to have met yoko ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

john claimed to have lost interest in the beatles due to paul mccartney's tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. together, he and yoko  destroyed the beatles, then he blamed the breakup on paul mccartney. 

he was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the black panthers.

he was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
his song writing was no better;  the lyrics to strawberry fields forever and come together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as i say, not as i do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. all you have to do is look at his songs. lennon, who sang imagine no possessions lived a millionaire's life in a posh new york hotel.  lennon sang imagine no religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and new age fad that came along, including hindu meditation, the i-ching, and astrology of all kinds.  and it was lennon who sang all you need is love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. and it was lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

lennon was a piece of shit and the world should know this about him.

"obese children are abused children. parents that feed their child a poor diet and cause them to be obese should be treated the same as anti-vaxxer parents. imo they are both abusing someone who has no say in their health regards and are exposing them to possible health issues in the future. among some of the things these children are exposed to are risk of diabetes type 2, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. this is not even taking into consideration the lack of self esteem and bullying the child might endure growing up. everyone says, look at the cute fat baby, but no one ever says, look at that fat cute teenager.

"spamming suicide hotline numbers at depressed people or suicidal people doesn't seem that helpful.. you know the last thing i think most suicidal or depressed people want to hear is? you need to talk to someone. you should talk to a therapist. you should call this hotline. 

you think they haven't fucking thought of that? no shit. it's the first thing anyone says when someone is depressed; you should talk to a therapist.

honestly? i don't think there's a way to measure it, but if someone calls that hotline i don't think they were going to do it anyways (other than the ones that called it and did it on the call).

it's just annoying to me that when people say they're depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says ""call this random number and talk to someone, oh i just know how you feel i've been there before""


edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. i'm gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. feel free to tell me i'm an idiot, but i swear to god this worked for me. you know what pulled me out of my slump? realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. if i was going to get out of it, i was going to have to be the one to make changes. at face value it sounds silly, but i really internalized this idea. i forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. it made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn't help i don't know what did. realizing society's shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, i was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. i took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. it wasn't easy, but i spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. this idea may be a crock of shit, but i gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them i thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. i actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all ""yeah, talk to someone!"" etc. was more helpful. if you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. they don't want to hear ""everything is okay"", they want to hear ""yeah you're right everything really is fucked."" if you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they'll appreciate it.

edit 2: i should have been more explicit when i wrote this. i'm sure hotlines help some people, i'm not saying they don't. i'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people.

edit 3: here's an analogy. your friend is in a hole (depression). you're standing outside of the hole. you're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"". in reality, it would be much more helpful if you could jump into the hole with them and show them the way out.

"if businesses only have to pay taxes on profit, not revenue. then i should only have to pay taxes after i've paid all my bills and rent.. businesses do not pay taxes on their gross revenue, they get to go to the irs and say, ""well this is what we paid paid our vendors, paid our staff and our bills, so we dont pay tax on this"". great, so it allows business to not have to pay taxes before they've taken out the costs of doing business.

regular joe however, pays taxes on their gross income which is massively unfair compared to businesses, my rent, food, bills and transport costs are also my cost of doing business. they are not optional, without those i cannot earn the money to make the salary i am paid.

the irs wouldnt have extra work to do either, they already look at tax submissions of businesses and see what their revenue and deducted business expenses were, they could do that for you and me too.

"i'm tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from ""woke"" poc and lgbtq+ communities. i'm a pansexual black/cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. throughout these 5 years i've seen so many people who swore they were ""woke"" proceed to do a poem that isn't much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. at the end of these poems, most poc go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they've done nothing but try to be an ally. 

this kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  a person of color can post anything about white people. they can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying ""i hate white people"" and be fine. same thing with queer people and straight people. 

and i get it. i'm black, cuban, queer, and a woman. i'm made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. my gender has been put down for centuries. i would've had to force myself into the closet if i was born a couple of centuries earlier. i know what it's like to be hated for who i am. i know what it's like to feel angry for what's been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. but i don't compliment these poems. i don't applaud. i don't like these posts. because it's wrong. this is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. this is all just tit for tat. 

you're not woke if you:

- make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can't take it back in your direction. 

-use generalizations like ""all white people"" or ""all straight people"" but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like ""all black people"" or ""all queer people. 

-refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they're a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn't want to interact with you because you're a queer person of color. 

-push allies away when they're trying to help you. 

-think you're better than anyone because of your identity. 

everyone has the right to be who they want. to be proud of their identity. you have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn't be hated and put down for it. but you shouldn't put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

next time you write a status or a poem about the ""other"" side, insert blanks on every time you name them. insert something represents you into the blanks. then read the poem and visualize someone from the ""other"" side reading it back to you. do you feel put down? that's what you're doing to others.

"a 'dislike' button on facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better. the title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but i do believe this to be true. the absence of a dislike button on facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and i believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


the only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an angry emoji or comment. the angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? you might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. this sends out the wrong message. this tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


it would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, i think it is important.

i notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people, and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me. for example the traits they shared would be: athletic accomplishments in sports, lifting, strong career and academic goals, involvement in clubs and student activities (both in hs and college), traveling, open mindedness, self created good appearance (due to taking care of self and clothing), and humble/positive personalities. i've had lab mates who went to oxford and harvard who i wouldn't have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. you know they're awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

i had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. for example one example of a former close i had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. after, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. his ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. he did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. he always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others. people initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills, but over time they see the truth that he's just a total loser. in the neighborhood i grew up with there were a lot of people like the one guy i described above.

naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. however with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence. this can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent, reputations can be irreparable.

"""my body my choice"" isn't a good argument against pro-life people. gonna start this off by immediately saying i am pro choice, and not going to get into debates about that here. i just want to say people who keep repeating the lines ""it is my body"" and ""it is my choice"" aren't going to sway any pro-life people to come to your side.

pro-life people believe that a fetus is alive, and aborting it is akin to murder, they don't see a difference between aborting a 2 month old fetus and killing a just born baby. so repeating the same lines at them over and over again with the assumption they agree a fetus isn't its own being with its own rights is just going to piss them off.

"calling a girl a ""cunt"" is literally the equivalent of calling a guy a ""dick"" and should be treated as such, but our society treats is as way worse.. why the fuck is this a thing? i remember getting kicked out of a frat party freshman year because i was talking about a girl from back home who i thought was a cunt and somebody overheard me. these are both the slang terms for genitalia in both genders, yet somehow calling a girl a cunt is up there with calling a black person the n-word. unfair double standards in my opinion.

i am sure this person has a very tough life. but whoever escorted him should have thought about the other movie goers and opted to enjoy a movie in a private space.

the rainbow should belong to everyone. it represents color and art. it represents a beautiful and near-magical natural phenomenon. 

it was a dick move to take a symbol that had meaning to everyone and limit it to representing who you'd rather fuck or date. 

people used to display the rainbow freely because it's a beautiful thing— on clothes, on designs; i even remember an airplane company with a rainbow tail. now whenever it's displayed, it's associated with a political movement. 

also, they kinda stereotyped themselves with a flag that represents an embrace of flamboyance. not every gay is flamboyant, only the most outspoken ones that dominate the face of the community.

journalism is just activism in sheep's clothing. why? because juicy stories sell to the masses. journalists should be treated with the same skepticism nowadays as used car salesmen, and perhaps more so.

"unattractive people should learn to accept that they're not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.. ""everybody is beautiful to somebody."" 

""ugly doesn't exist."" 

""everybody is equally attractive in their own way."" 

""looks don't even matter. what's on the inside determines whether you're attractive or not.""

""you're perfect just the way you are."" 


these quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. it's like everyone needs to believe they're attractive or else. god forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

but... why? is being unattractive that bad? is attractiveness a person's only value to humanity? are the lies necessary?

sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. but alas, this is planet earth and life isn't fair. some people are born with attractive features; some are not. some are born with blatantly unattractive features. yes, that's nobody's fault, but that's just the way it is. 

before you say ""beauty is subjective"", you can't deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. for men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. for women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. aside from certain fetishists, i've yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites.

if your child gets to the point where their weight starts to cause health problems you should be charged with child abuse and have your child taken away.

you're letting them learn eating habits that are going to cause them to likely be fat their entire life, putting them at a higher risk for a long list of serious health issues.

i understand that (at least in the states) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. for the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


and on taking kids away from parents i agree there should be some steps before that happens. there should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. but if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

"judging people by their looks works well for the vast majority of cases.. so here's the thing: looks are not something that just randomly fell into place or whatever, but they are to a large part the result of choices and efforts made. for example, if you are well kept and wear a professional outfit, you're probably someone that cares a lot about impressions and your career, and most likely you have a fairly conservative outlook on life. equally, if you look like a stoner or like you don't care about your looks, then that also says something about your values and beliefs. there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's just obvious. if you are a woman, cut your hair short, and dye it three different colors, it's also not too hard to guess your political leanings. same for someone running around in polo shirts and boat shoes only.

sending food to countries that can't feed themselves only makes the problem worse. the root of the problem is these people can't feed themselves. feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can't be fed. either teach these people to farm or let them starve. if they aren't capable of farming, survival of the fittest. 

parts of africa are like the crazy cat lady. she sees a few starving cats and thinks this is horrible, so she feeds them. pretty soon they reproduce and she has even more cats to feed. what started out as a few starving cats turns into 50 starving cats. she hasn't solved a problem she just made it worse. she had good intentions but didn't stop cats from starving, she just created more starving cats.

there are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200b;

the first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. he is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. i know, crazy right?

&#x200b;

the second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. you are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200b;

now, reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200b;

1. no guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. i'm not saying that a guy should say ""do this for me, or i'm leaving."" i'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. that relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. this obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, i only picked men and sex because i tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. if both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then i guess it's a match made in heaven.

&#x200b;

edit: **holy shit! gold! omfg!!!**

edit2: ***""i would like to thank the academy...""***

edit 3: i'm gonna fuck off for a (long) while, but i keep getting the same question so i'll answer it here:

&#x200b;

this post was inspired by myself and a group of guys talking about our past relationships and the commonalities we noticed with each other.

for me, it was a girl in high school who refused to kiss me (we did everything else but no kissing), but admitted to me that she'd kissed her ex a lot. i dumped her. girls i've been with since haven't held back like that (at least not that i was aware of.)

another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

another guy wasn't getting blowjobs, but found out from a mutual friend that his girlfriend loved giving them to an ex.

there are more, but they're all pretty much the same story.",6
"toxic femininity is worse than toxic masculinity. in recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. the current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. but during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

when you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. the whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

&#x200b;

but when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. a lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. a few examples being;

* blaming behavioural issues on periods
* acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200b;

some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. it's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. some of these examples are major toxic offences. such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

one of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

"dear humans: vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". it *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that. (blame ice cream's history). when you are served ice cream, you are served vanilla as the ""default"" ice cream. and it is white, a word often synonymous with ""blank"" or ""empty"". this made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. but it's not.

it really doesn't help that in the u.s., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""american cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.) vanilla was once described in europe as the ""essence and epitome of flavor"". that's why it became so common. and over time, vanilla was widely substituted with cheaper things. ""natural vanilla flavor"" isn't vanilla. it's a natural flavor that tastes kinda like it (and often comes from something you don't want to hear about, not that i think there's anything wrong with substitute flavors in general). real vanilla is fantastic.

stop misrepresenting vanilla. it's a great flavor. (although i know that software terms are already dooming ""vanilla"" to continue being thought of as ""boring"", and there's nothing i can do to fix that. as if ""vanilla minecraft"" is even boring... sigh.)",6

"telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not why we are really afraid.. anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the kavanaugh hearings. resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

the conversation went as such: if you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

yeah. no shit. the reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **or** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). so... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

what isn't outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. the implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* in effect, it was a lie by omission. 

and the above really isn't my point anyways. here's the main point:

*in a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. there are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

so, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* where's the deterrent there? 

another question that i have never once seen given a good answer:

how does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? this is how *most* consent occurs anyways. other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: intimacy with a woman. 

we have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

lastly: i want to be wrong. 

here's what you can do if i am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard i've found. 

i'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that i am *nowhere close* to being alone here. relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. you won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on facebook. talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on reddit at least.  

so, if i am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that i am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

"the word ""moist"" isn't gross. the circlejerk over it is ridiculous.. there seems to be this meme of the word *moist* being inherently disgusting and creepy, and i don't get it. is ""damp"" really a better word to use? what sounds more appetizing, a *moist* cake or a *damp* cake?

personally i think the words *petulant* and *hemorrhage* are a little bit gross-sounding, but they are words for a reason and i'm not going to throw a conniption fit if somebody uses them. it's not like they're slurs.

edit: i might have been a bit harsh in my wording. i know it's just my opinion, and some people are grossed out by it. i understand why some people have a negative association with the word, but i just don't associate it with bodily fluids unless it's used in that context. obviously i'm not going to double down on using it if it truly does bother somebody. i'm not an asshole.

i mixed up the words *petulant* and *pustulent,* but the two words do sound somewhat similar. obviously the reasons *pustulent* and *hemorrhage* are gross sounding is because of what they mean. i'm not going to avoid them if i need to use either.",6

&#x200b;

people have the right to be a piece of shit outside of the work place. the punishment has no relation to the offense and its basically thought crime. its not any different than keying their car. it's cowardly and childish.

&#x200b;

you don't know that person's situation or who depends on them. that person could be supporting children or a sick relative. and getting them fired will likely embitter them and reinforce their beliefs.

"women who are making fun of men for being offended by the gillette ad are being extremely hypocritical and it drives me mad.. whether you agree with it or not, some men have taken offense to the things said and the ideas being pushed by the recent gillette advertisement. with these feelings being brought to light on social media i've started to see many different instances of women criticizing the feelings of these men stating that ""they should only be offended if they are the toxic male audience that gillette is criticizing"" and it drives me mad. why can every other group of people feel offended but when straight males are targeted and feel as if they are being unfairly portrayed it is socially acceptable to mock these claims for internet clout? why can't men feeling offended by something be considered legitimate?

"schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing.. you have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. so many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. i had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and i had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until i cried so i was forced to give up, not to mention that was a huge expense every month some families might not be able to spare. different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. turns out i didn't even have acne. i have a very common condition called kp, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. if you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. i could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. these kids essentially have an addiction. the majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine bmi and extremely healthy. not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

i knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

all in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. i'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? it is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? we often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

we should be realistic with children from a very young age. say things like, ""you can do so much"", ""the future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""you can be literally anything you want to be""

if you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. it should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she's growing a developing fetus. 

it should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not. at the very least, cps should be allowed to intervene before the child is born, and remove the child upon birth. 

edit: for those who keep bring it up, no, weening after a few weeks when you know you're pregnant would not be ground for removal in this scenario. this applies to those who have no intent of quitting, and exhibit no attempt at quitting either behaviors. common sense would still be applied by cps.

"fuck disney. not sure how unpopular this is but seriously fuck disney. they buy out franchises and focus solely on making money off of it. i get marvel is vastly loved but they've make way too many movies so quickly. or star wars, i dont even want to see ep. 9. i loved star wars as a kid and then got so excited for the force awakens. remaking old classics like lion king or aladdin. yeah its cool seeing live action versions. all disney does is market our childhood for todays generation to make a new ammount of profift. fuck disney or at least the people running it now",6
"the reddit mascot looks like a stupid teletubby. i hate it.. does it even has a name? also, orange is the colour of the dangerous maniacs. all the inmates of a mental prison wear orange. pretty well-fitting to this place and its community imo.",6
"a good movie is still a good movie even after an actor or director does something bad or illegal.. same with music and other media. you can enjoy watching or listening to something regardless of whether the person who made it was a kiddy fiddler or murdered someone. it's not a reflection on you or your beliefs.

too many people are so concerned with what these famous people are doing in their personal lives and i honestly couldn't care less as long as the things that entertain me aren't affected.",6
"if your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse.. 
imo a dr or teacher should be able to contact cps for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

last night i saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. it broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

i don't know their circumstances and for the most part, i am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. however, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). a child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

these poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

edit: thank you for mentioning the factors i naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. these points are very valid and make a lot of sense. perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

i had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

as anyone, i am speaking from my own experience and i did come from a family who struggled with money. i don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 i think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. my doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. i have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

edit 2: i remembered more of our eating habits as a child. we had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. we also spent a lot of time outside. all in all, education is a huge influencer and effort makes a difference!

also for the love of god everyone saying this is a popular opinion should read the comments because a good portion disagree with me. yay for a lively debate!",6
"unicorn flavored things should taste like horse meat. i feel like unicorns are becoming a fad and the flavor is generally just either berries and sugar, cotton candy, or funfetti. if you were to eat a unicorn, i imagine it would be more meaty- though i know literally no one would be able to (dis)prove that.  i'm not advocating eating horses. and if unicorns were real, i wouldn't advocate eating them either.",6
"reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people.. hear me out.

i originally came here because i heard that reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. that was a lie.

subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

the problem with the rules and independent moderation of reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. it doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

most moderators just want safe spaces. they usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

all of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use reddit are. (being liberal is okay, i'm a moderate, so i don't really care). both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. i've seen conservatives do it too. just not as much. sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

the icing on the cake is that reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. i have faith in time it will die.

censorship will kill reddit.

safe spaces will kill reddit. 

cancerous moderation will kill reddit.

admins who side with the more socially acceptable will kill reddit.


edit: by ""moderate"" i'm saying that i'm in the middle, i base my political beliefs on what i think is right, and i don't agree wholeheartedly with either party. both have great and terrible beliefs. i go with logic and empathy over blindly siding with one side of a spectrum. i'm pretty sure that's what moderate means, but some people seem to think moderate is something else. i'm just clearing that up.",6
"making a public tweet about someone sexually abusing you isn't brave, go to the police.. if you're ""brave"" enough to come forward and accuse someone publicly and have your followers shame them but don't have the balls to file an official police report than chances are you're full of shit.

edit: i wrote this late. my wording shouldve been ""making a tweet instead of going to the police""

2nd edit: to clear things up a bit with a bit of context since a lot of people have taken this personally. ive seen a lot of people share their stories about their crappy experiences with cops but you guys at least tried which tells me that an actual crime happened. i'm talking about the people that don't even attempt to go to the cops and yet have no issue coming out on twitter and using their followers instead.
recently in the voice acting scene a popular va has been accused of sexual assault because he gets affectionate and hugs all his fans and sometimes pecks them on the cheek. hes now being fired from everything and some of his fellow vas are coming out saying that he sexually assaulted them too. they havent tried going to the police nor have they said anything other than the blanket term ""sexual assault"" which these days could be a hug. 
i've seen people say ""wow seeing this backlash i can see why its hard for women to come forward"" theres a big difference between going to the police and making a report and publicly going after someone that has a dedicated fan following. 
apparently this has been happening for years but no one got a restraining order against him and no one is getting specific on what it is they did. they're ""brave"" enough to use a blanket term but they don't have the balls to say whether it was rape,grope etc and then they wonder why so many people don't believe them.

"i enjoy walking through spider webs.. i love accidentally walking through a spider web. it has gotten to the point where i try to walk in between things where i think there might be spider webs because i love the feeling of them on my face and skin. the feeling of it sticking to your skin is almost like a tickle. i don't really mind there being a spider on the web either, they usually fall off of my clothes anyways.",6
"people obsessed with sports are just as nerdy as people into video games or dungeons and dragons.. title says it pretty well. don't get me wrong i'm a huge sports fan, i like teams in the ncaa, nfl, and mlb. i follow them all very closely. i am a nerd because of that. i sit alone and watch games and yell and carry on, but so many people are in denial about this.

there are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing. that should garner just as much criticism as majoring in psychology, gender studies, and sociology. those degrees are completely useless if you don't get a job like selling tickets for your local college team.

we all know someone who is that ""sports are my life guy"" 

also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or d&d are these sports nerds. there's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it. 

edit: getting a lot of replies because i included psychology, i have a psych degree myself just saying if you don't go to grad school it doesn't help much finding jobs.

edit 2: lots of furry hate on here, which it's funny how random that is. but the point i'm trying to make is live and let live.  

edit 3: hey, hey, hey, this is not an opportunity to rip on people who like sports either, the main point i'm trying to make is live and let live. if you're tearing into ""sports jocks"" for being unintelligent on here then you're just as bad as the guys who this post was initially targeting. 

edit 4: if you're going to call this out for not being unpopular check the comments, there is a large amount of dissenting opinions. just because you personally agree doesn't mean something isn't widely unpopular ",6
"the poop-themed stuff that's popular with kids right now is repulsive. and down right stupid. if you send your kid to school wearing a shirt that has a pile of shit on it, you're a fucking clown.. i think it started with the poop emoji (💩), but lately i've been seeing kids with poop clothes, toys, games, etc. a friend of mine is even throwing his four year old daughter a poop-themed birthday party. i find all of it disgusting. no part of me thinks it's even remotely funny or cute. the fact that there's an entire trend based off of human feces baffles me. i can't wait until it blows over. maybe i'm an asshole, i don't know, but it needs to stop.

"any reason is a valid reason to not date someone.. imo there is no wrong and invalid reason to not date someone. dating and relationships as a whole are entirely based around personal preference. its perfectly fine to not date someone   for any reason, as it all comes down to personal preference.

don't want to date a white person? cool

don't want to date a poor person? cool

don't want to date a muslim? cool

relationships come down to personal preference and as such all reasons are valid ones for why you don't want to date someone.",6
"if two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped. i see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. if two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? the logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? i will never understand this or accept it. i agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. i cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

edit: i've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things i think i should clarify. i absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. i have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what i have seen and what i believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

"people who say you should like tomatoes if you like ketchup are complete idiots.. ketchup isnt the exact equivalent of tomatoes just because it contains it. its processed and contains other things such as vinegar, sweeteners, salt and even onion or garlic. the actual fruit doesnt have those characteristics therefore they are different. its just dumb.",6
"i like it when my sleeves get wet when i wash my hands.. whenever i wash my hands i don't roll up my sleeves, and instead i allow the nice cold water to embrace my sleeves. like it just feels really cool and nice when my sleeves are wet and sticking to my skin. i make sure that a good inch or two of my sleeves are wet. especially on a hot day this is useful, since it basically feels like free air conditioner.

"youtube wanting to take away the dislike button is a big deal and should be treated as such.. it's the only source of leverage that we as a creative community have. if that thing gets removed, youtube officially sells its soul to the advertisers. and yes i know they did that a long time ago. but this is one of the last old features that they will be removing from youtube.

this is a big deal.

the worst part is that we can't do anything about it.",6
