"What is a sensation that you can't stand, even though it's not painful ?",,AskReddit
People aren't homophobic. You're just weird.,"I'm a gay guy. I've got a beard, a build, and I dress like most humans do. I don't lisp when I talk, and I don't spend my time gossiping about other people in a weird Jersey Girl accent (which would sound annoying enough on a woman). I don't dress in drag and attempt to stick my anus in the faces of bewildered pedestrians at exhibitionistic pride parades. People know I'm gay, and you know how much homophobia I've experienced in my life? ZERO. Not even from ultra conservative people.

I talk about my sex life like heterosexual people do, and my friends support it. No one bats an eye. I don't try to fuck my straight friends, first of all because they are my friends, and secondly because they are straight. No one feels weirded out in my presence.

Much of what we call homophobia today isn't an inordinate fear of gay people. It's not even really a fear. More of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

It's ok to be weird. It's ok to be offensive. It's ok to act like a girl if you are a guy. Just don't be surprised if the majority of the population finds you odd. Because you are odd. And your oddities have dick all to do with the fact that you like dick, and no one is responding inappropriately because you like dick.

Edit: to the dipshit posters here who are pointing out the existence of homophobic family members, READ MY POST. Stop confusing your emotional inertia for the content of my rhetoric. I said, very clearly, that ""MUCH of what we call homophobia today isn't..."" 

That's me saying to the daft ones here: yes, my post is hyperbolic. Yes, there is still real homophobia in our world.

Double Edit: to the mega dipshits who found an older post of me talking about my sexual experiences with women, your ignorance is mind boggling. I had two girlfriends out of high school (and by that I mean after high school, my second relationship was years past college ****) one short relationship with a girl in grade nine. And I've slept with plenty of randos. Nothing special. Talk to most gay guys and they'll admit they played the straight game for years, sometimes even decades before coming out. Now stop digging into my *sexual history like a bunch of voyeuristic weirdos and move along.",unpopularopinion
"UPDATE: I am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. I got found out.","I post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

Since that time I got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until I landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. She calls at least once per day. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

How incredibly bad is that plan? Before anyone says it. I know... I know ok I should have quit a long time ago. I did not.

TIFU by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging,"Happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

I was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. I noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

Normally, I wouldn't think twice about it, but I was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. Plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

We pull up to a stop light, and I hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. Apparently he didnt see me, because when I said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

Being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, I let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

As I turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. The way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

As I'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. It didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

She then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as I'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. The way she viewed it, I was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

The cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

TL;DR I stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

Edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. It was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford F-350",tifu

"We spend TOO much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.","I get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and I am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  I don't debate that and I have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. Not only respect, but gratitude.  The world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. But still...

Edit - added sources for the statistics I used, as people seem to be going down that tangent. Maybe not the best sources, but the first that popped up and seemed legit. I appreciate the debate around what's defined as poverty, I think it's a good debate. But even if you only count people who are literally starving, it's still twice as many people and that doesn't invalidate my initial statement. Have a nice day!

"Step Father's grandson is ""home-schooled"" by his daughter. Child is 8 years old, can't count beyond 20. Doesn't fully know the alphabet, and doesn't really know how to play/interact with other kids because he spends most of his time at home in a small apartment.","(Note I say step father but my mom is not married to him. They live separately but I still call him my step dad)  

His daughter used to live with him until my step dad demanded she get a job or go to school. she instead left with her son and moved in with and married her boyfriend. It was around this time that he had to start preschool, and she said that she was going to home school him and she's been home schooling him ever since. 

Fast forward three years and their relationship has gotten better so she'll occasionally drop him off to visit. He's 8 now and I've noticed how far behind he is. I'm a High school senior and do a lot of volunteering at elementary schools. So when he comes to visit I like to spend my time teaching him. I taught him the basic alphabet, first couple numbers, etc. These are things he should know already. He learns very quickly and enjoys it. So I don't suspected he has any learning disabilities. I also read to him and once gave him a book as a gift. 

A few visits later while talking to him I come to find out that all he knows is what I've taught him and that the book I gave him is the only thing he's been reading because that's the only book he owns. He also tells me that he doesn't do ""learning time"" with his mom. ( ""learning time"" is what I call it when I teach him )

My friend has a younger brother the same age so I'll have her bring him over when he's visiting. While they play he acts like he's a toddler compared to him. I didn't think much of it until  my friends little brother asked him if he has any friends and he said no. He tells him that he stays at home all day. 

My step father notices this, and so does my mom and friend. We didn't say anything to each other not wanting to be rude or sound paranoid but the conversation came up and my step dad admitted he's been feeling horrible about it ever since. He wants to take action but doesn't want to get his daughter in trouble. She's living off welfare and I forgot to mention that she's legally blind. ( not completely but enough to give her disability ) He's also scared she won't let him see his grandson anymore if he mentions it. 


I'm really worried about him but I don't know what can be done and neither does my step dad. He doesn't care for her and only wants what's best for his grandson. He would want to get custody but he works two jobs at the moment and wouldn't have the time to care for him. 

We live in Nevada. Clark County District. What happens if we call CPS? Is there any legal way to make her enroll him in school? And is there a chance that if they see she's not educating him that they'll take him away?",legaladvice

Hi guys!

I'm back with the long-awaited update. But first, thank you all who responded on my first post and gave their advice! I definitely wouldn't of asked if it weren't for all the positive comments!

A lot of you suggested that I just shoot him a text and give him an update in terms of my situation and then ask him if we could meet up for coffee (dinner seemed too much like a date) so I could return his sweatshirt and thank him. That's basically exactly what I did. 

I shot him a text and told him that I had filed the police report and that the police will be in contact with me. Then I asked him (in a double text) if I could take him out to coffee to thank him and return his sweatshirt. He actually didn't respond for a good day and I was really starting to feel like I'd totally overstepped but then he did! He first told me that it was great that I filed the report and then he asked me how I was feeling. He also said that I didn't have to thank him and that he was just doing what anyone would've done if they were in that situation, but that a quick coffee sounded good. So we scheduled to have coffee on a Saturday morning. 

Going into our meeting, I was actually super nervous for some reason and ended up being 15 minutes early. So I sat for about 10 minutes, fidgeting with his sweater and waiting for him to show up. To be honest, I wasn't even that sure I knew what he looked like. The entire night is still pretty jumbled and when he was walking me back, I barely paid any attention to him (it was also super dark) since I was just replaying what happened over and over again in my head. I just remembered he was tall and had a nice smile. 

Then, this really tall dude walks in, scans the shop, sees me and then gives me an awkward smile and waves. I didn't know what to say after our initial niceties, so I just blurted out, ""Woah, your eyes are actually blue, I thought they were brown haha."" I wanted to crawl into a hole after I said that but he laughed and said, ""Yea they can be deceiving in the dark."" Then we ordered coffee (he refused to let me pay) and we sat down. First things first, I gave him back his sweatshirt and he thanked me. We ended up chatting for two hours about mostly random stuff, like our classes, our summer, the Office (which is also my favorite show), politics, music, etc. I also asked him why he decided to call me ""Maddie"" when he was trying to save me and he told me he read an article somewhere that if you pretend to know a stranger who's in trouble, you're most likely to help without escalating the situation or getting you or the other person hurt. 

So yes, he's sweet and caring and devilishly handsome and we really clicked. But he didn't seem that interested in me, not that it was a date. So we then went about five days with no contact until I came across a meme about the Office and decided on a whim to send it to him. It ended up being a good decision since we ended up talking until 1:00 am. Next morning, I was feeling bold again and after much debating, I sent him a text that said, ""Hey, can I please take you out to lunch? Coffee didn't count since you didn't even let me pay for you."" 

He said yes and this time I managed to successfully pay for our meal. I wore a nice sundress to lunch and he said, ""I love that dress! You look really good!"" We had a really great time again but as we were leaving the restaurant I realized that he left his phone on the chair so I grabbed it and gave it to him. (This is important later on). 

About two weeks later (he went out of town but we were still sporadically texting), he sends me a text that said, ""Hey, can I take you out to dinner to thank you for grabbing my phone?"" OMG. He's too cute. (For those of you who might not have caught on, he was mimicking how I asked him out). Anyway, of course I said yes and now we're going out to dinner tomorrow night. 

Ahhh I like him a lot but I have no idea how he feels about me. Maybe I'll ask him over dinner tomorrow. :) But so far, that's what has happened. 

TL;DR: I asked him out to coffee! Then I asked him out to lunch! Then he asked me out to dinner!

TIFU by summoning a Kenyan drug lord on a school trip,"Yes Reddit. Its here. For those just joining us, I must again apologise for this took place some time ago.

In my second last year of secondary school I was fortunate enough to participate in a volunteer program in East Africa over my summer holidays. The idea was we'd spend a month constructing new classrooms for a struggling school on the coast of Kenya, south of Mombasa and then work in a safari park (Shimba Hills IIRC) before crossing over to Tanzania for an actual safari in Ngorongoro Crater and then top it off with an ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro. This wasn't free by the way, I had signed up for it a year before and had participated in loads of fund raising events to make it happen.

We had two teachers accompany us on the trip, Mr F who was a no nonsense former Royal Marine Commando as well as Mr B who was an absolute legend. Mr F's girlfriend also joined us, she wasn't a teacher but she had first aid qualifications. 

Mr F utterly despised me and my friends who were, embarrassingly, the sk8r/st0ner contingent of the school, with long hair, band t's, the works. To him we were useless pinheads and he sent us on all the worst jobs on the construction site. Mr B was more interested in ordering in crates of Kilimanjaro beer and trading albums with me (AFI - Sing the Sorrow for NOFX - So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes was probably my favourite swap). I wont digress too much but giving a band of Masai Mara warriors my CD player later in the trip and watching them do their leaping dances to NOFX was awesome.

During our free time we had befriended the local villagers who enjoyed inviting us to their homes for food and trying to sell us trinkets, cigarettes and awful tasting home-brewed coconut wine. Eventually the most charismatic villager, a fisherman named Sayid stepped up to the plate and offered us some weed. We bought a stick off him for about $5 down in the mangroves thinking we'd smoke it later when the teachers were asleep but he insisted on rolling it up, pure, into a single huge spliff and we hopped in his little boat and he took us on a tour of the mangrove swamp.

""You like?"" He said.
""Yeh its not bad, at home we smoke hash though, do you get it in Kenya too?"" I replied. Remember this part, as everything that happened later is contingent on this verbal exchange.

During the boat ride I wasn't feeling much, but then it suddenly hit me as we went back to shore: pure brain melt, watery bloodshot eyes, insane paranoia. Then the bell rang summoning us back to the camp. I was not ready. We tried to join up with the rest of the group as inconspicuous as possible, but likely looking as conspicuous as hell. Over the course of lunch Mr F kept on giving us weird looks, feeding my paranoia even more. Eventually his GF came up to us and said something like ""Boys, your eyes look a bit funny, what have you been up to?"" Cold sweats.
""Its just hay-fever miss, the villagers took us in the long grass and the pollen got me really bad"".
""It doesn't look like that too me, I better not see you like this again or you'll be sent home"".

About half an hour later, two unexpectedly looking nice cars came down the dirt track leading to our camp. I didn't give them much heed but they pulled up to the gate and about 5 or 6 of the scariest looking dudes got out. 

""[My name], can you come to the gate, some people want to speak to you"" someone said, I don't remember who. 

As I was still high I started to panic again and the paranoia was back. I walked over to them. I'm not sure how the conversation went, but the scope of this most colossal fuck up dawned on me. Sayid had totally misunderstood me with his broken English. He had thought that I was asking to send hash back home and this was his lucky day and he could act as broker for a deal that would set him up for life, likely calling someone who called someone else and so on until the news had reached some senior guy from Mombasa who had come down to the camp to strike a deal. And listen Reddit, before you jump on me and call me an idiot and tell me not to travel, lets think about this first. In no way is this a reasonable outcome for the conversation I just had. Yeh fine, smoking on a school trip is never a good idea, but I was in the army cadets for 4 years and every trip turned into a smoke up after dark without incident.

I think I managed to mumble some sort of feeble excuse like ""I'm sorry I have to go"". Then I ran and hid in the toilets and locked the door.

About a minute later I heard Mr F yell my name.

""Where the fuck are you, you filthy little druggie""
""Where is he boys?""
""Hes in the toilet sir""
Silence, then Mr F's huge tree trunk arms pounding on the door.
""You fucking little shit, what have you done? Who are these people? Come out here now""

""I can't sir.... I'm on the toilet, its really bad"" This was sadly the best thing I could think of.
""Get the fuck out here now""
""I can't sir, its diarrhoea, really bad""
""You fucking little liar, open this door""

He was trying to shake it off its hinges. I wanted to die, I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, I was going to get expelled, my parents were going to kill me, my life was effectively over.

At this point Mr F's girlfriend and Mr B stepped in, urging him to calm down.

""Let us talk to him"". 
""What happened, why are these people here""
""I'm so sorry, I was just talking about weed and he must of got the wrong idea, I have no idea how this could of happened.""

Somehow it was smoothed over, I don't know how, but I stayed in that toilet for hours, fearing shame, mockery and punishment when eventually that door was opened. When I came out the dealers from Mombassa were gone. The teachers had searched all my stuff and found nothing which had further supported my defence. 

The rest of the trip passed without incident. I wasn't expelled, my parents weren't called, Mr F was even nice to me after a few days, probably embarrassed about totally flipping out. Sure there were a few jokes but it was just too surreal to continually feel bad about. Also I think Mr B and Miss F had done me a huge favour by calming Mr F, coming to my defence and for that I am forever grateful.

TL;DR a simple misunderstanding during a conversation with an enterprising Kenyan fisherman resulted in gangsters driving down from Mombassa to arrange terms with me for a hash smuggling operation back to the UK, temporarily making a teacher go berserk at me.

Edit 1: Thank you again for all the feedback. It's been great having this interaction as it's been a lonely time on my road trip these last few weeks.

I'll try and post my Indian mishap on Sunday and round off the trilogy. 

On a final note before I go to bed: Travel has really helped me with some serious issues in my life such as depression, anxiety and low self esteem. I'd like to create an elitism free space to help and encourage others to give it a go and share experiences, both positive and calamitous. If anyone knows of a suitable medium please message me (I'm not particularly tech savvy FYI).  

Edit 2: I should of elaborated on this more but the library was closing and I was trying to hammer out the events as fast as possible on a proper keyboard. They were driving clean BMWs (or similar) in an area where most people didn't even have a car, same goes for their clothing.

AITA for blasting my horn at a person using their phone whilst driving?,"This happened about 30 minutes ago. 

I was driving home with a friend. We were coming up to a roundabout that was clear from my side. As I was passing over, a woman came speeding past from the left, causing me to have to slow down substantially in the middle of the roundabout. 

She was on her phone, holding it by her head with her elbow resting on the open window, speaking into it. I blasted my horn at her, a slight bit of road rage sure, but this startled her and caused her to drop her phone out the car window. 

I don't know what happened after that, but it's a busy roundabout so I doubt she was able to retrieve it before it was smashed into a million pieces. The person I was driving with blasted me, saying I shouldn't have done that and I was an asshole for causing the destruction of what was presumably an expensive phone. I disagree, play stupid games win stupid prizes and all that. But, my friend is insistent that I was an asshole. 

AITA?

EDIT: women to woman.

EDIT: okay holy shit this blew up. I can't read through all the comments, so I'll just try clear up a couple things. 

1) This is in England, we give way to the right and not the left. The roundabout was a 2 lane on a busy street, no pedestrian access. 

2) For those saying obviously NTA, karma whoring etc - I get it. If I could lock this post now I would. However, there's been quite a few ESH's and YTA's with good points, and I'm now thinking whilst NTA feels good, and there is a sense of instant karma, ESH is probably more appropriate. I shouldn't have blazed my horn, it wasn't really an emergency, and in doing so I could've caused a worse accident.

Some people don't seem to understand how roundabouts in England work. To try clear things up, I've drawn the worlds worst diagram.

TIFU by fucking my bf into a seizure,"I'm going to preface this TIFU by saying, no, this didn't actually happen today. It has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

It was our first Valentine's Day together this year. I woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

I decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. It was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

I needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

This is when things begin to go wrong.

All of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. I glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (He has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


Sure enough, he began to violently seize. I go full protective mode and try to help him. He was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

We're both still naked and I have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode.

And sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. I apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""Babe you fucked me into a seizure..I'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
So not only, on our FIRST Valentine's Day together did I literally fuck him into a seizure, but I also dislocated his shoulder.

TIFU by getting a DNA test and revealing a family secret,"I've always been interested in doing one of those at-home kits that tell you your ethnicity estimates.  My mother has, for many years, claimed that her own great-grandmother was completely Native American, and I recently learned that this is apparently something common for Southerners to claim, but that it is rarely true.  I finally went ahead and bought one of the kits because there is nothing I enjoy more in life than proving my mother wrong.  

Fast forward a few weeks.  I get my results.  I am 0% Native America, which isn't exactly shocking.  The real surprise comes from the fact that I am also 0% Eastern European.

This probably wouldn't mean much for most people, but I happen to be Polish.  Or at least, I thought I was.  I have an unpronounceable, very Polish last name.  My great-grandparents were Polish-speaking immigrants.  My paternal grandfather himself spoke Polish as a child.

My first thought was that the test was a mistake.  My results came over a week before the projected arrival date, and I KNEW I should be somewhere around 25% Polish/Eastern European.  So maybe there had been an error somewhere at the lab.  I started digging around through my DNA relative matches.  I had matched with an extended cousin with my mom's maiden name, living in the state that she grew up in.  So the DNA analyzed was definitely mine, and this was not a switched-tube situation.

There were only two possible explanations:  either my own dad was not my biological father, or my Polish grandfather was not the biological father of my dad.  

I look a lot like my father, so it seemed unlikely that we were not related.  However, there was no strong family resemblance between my dad and his own father.  In fact, my grandfather and many of his siblings had a (we'll call it) striking nose that my sister and I had often rejoiced in not inheriting.  Also, my paternal grandparents had a disastrous marriage and bitter divorce—an affair did not seem out of the question.

My paternal grandfather died over ten years ago, but my paternal grandmother is still living and I gave her a call.  It took a while for me to fully explain the DNA testing to her—she's 87, but we got there.  She denied it and tried to explain the unexpected results with a long ramble about migrating European tribes before I was finally able to make her understand that I would be able to test relatives from the Polish side of the family and determine whether or not I was actually related to them.  She told me that she didn't think that was a good idea, and I should think about it before contacting anyone.

I think I knew right then, but it was not until today, two days later, that she finally admitted it to my sister:  my father had been lied to his entire life about his biological father.  

So who is my actual paternal grandfather?  TBD.  My grandmother promised my sister that she will tell the two of everything when my sister gets into town for Christmas.  She requested that we not tell anyone until then (it's too late, my sister already told everyone).  

TL;DR:  Did an ethnicity test, found out my father was apparently the product of an extra-marital affair and never knew.  

Edit to add: I've had a recent string of people asking me for an update.  I posted one a while back, here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7kat5w/tifupdate_and_the_grandfather_is/  ",tifu
(Update) My mother said she would kill herself the day I graduate high school (WA),"Hey.

Well, I have some good news. After I made the original post, I talked with my mother about the situation, and what was going on. Once I confronted her about it, she started crying. She said that she had fulfilled her purpose in life, and it's time for me and my brother to fulfill ours. I disagreed, and told her to stop with that, and made her a promise. If she kills herself, then her purpose would not be fulfilled. She wouldn't be able to meet the expectation that I want her at my college graduation, or at my wedding, or at any other celebrations of achievements. I told her that I need her to stay alive and that it's not negotiable no matter, as her simply being somewhere gives hope for future endeavors.

Last Monday, I graduated from high school with my friends, and finished my first year of college at the same time! It was a good time, and I finally get some breathing room for a little bit. I went home, hung out with some people, and then went to bed. To this day, she's alive and well, doing what she would normally do on a day to day basis. I wanted to wait a week to ensure everything would be okay, and I'm glad to report that it is. 

The day that I made the original post, it was closing night of a school play for which I was a part of. With many people in that theater department being on Reddit, a couple of people put the dots together and know that I posted that. To those whom I know IRL, I'm doing okay, and everything will be alright. You know where and how to contact me if you need me, love you guys.

How do you repair relations with crows?,"Story is relevant.

My neighbourhood has a lot of crows. Over twenty of them. They are generally on good terms with one another.

I watched them band together and kill one of the crows. They left its dead body in my yard. I waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because I don't want crow guts everywhere.

However, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. This brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. None of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

Now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time I am outside. Some swoop. They are becoming more and more aggressive.

Confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do I repair relations with these crows? I don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

Google is not helpful on this front at all. There is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.

TIFU by encouraging female ejaculation [NSFW],"So I've been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we've cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit. This wasn't a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there's no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting.

That being said, a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive pornography-grade squirting. She goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how, and we proceed to make plans to explore this further. Next thing I know she's cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to extinguish a burning chemical factory while I'm right there dumping fuel on the flames.

Now, before I get carried away here, I'll just say, I'm a [M] nurse by trade, and I have no delusions about what's really going on. I can tell exactly where her 'juices' are coming from, and I've made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while I go down on her, no big deal.

So finally, to the point. She's been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and I've gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes. The most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss didn't taste at all like I'd thought it would. Ranging from unflavored Gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants (that you dump sugar packets into). I thought it was a fluke at first, but after repeatedly testing this observation, I'm quite certain that her piss tastes sweet, sometimes blatantly so.

The perverted side of me thought all this was kinky as hell, so I really didn't think on it too much until this morning. I just woke up and had a weird nurse's epiphany about it. Sweet urine. Glucose urine. Glycosuria. Jesus Christ. I'm a fucking dumbass. I race over to my bag where I keep my backup glucometer for work, wake her bleary-eyed ass up, and pricked her finger to check her blood sugar. 441. **Fuck!** Recheck. 453. **Shit!!** Asymptomatic, but hyperglycemic as fuck. She's got the Beetus. Diabetes. I broke the news as gently as I could, which was something to the tune of ""Holy shit fuck! That's some serious fucking diabetes! Call your doctor!"" Hysterics ensued. So now she's out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment, and I'm sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how I knew..

TLDR; TIFU by breaking some bad news to a girl after she ""squirted"" in my face and I diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet.

---------------------------------

UPDATE: Insert the obligatory ""omg this went supernova!!1"" .. On a serious note though, thanks for the reddit gold~~en shower~~. This has been a long day and I haven't felt this cool on the Internet since that time I used a voice modulator in an MMORPG to convince my guild I was a black guy.

To bring things current, the girl is doing fine now, they've ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she's a type 1 diabetic, but it'll take a few days and tests to confirm the preliminary results. She's got a lot on her mind, all I can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to irreversibly connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth.

Still, the response has been hilariously fantastic. While there's a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up, I'll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that, such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together, my majorly panicked reaction to it, and the resulting state of hysteria I had caused after scaring the girl half to death. That all kind of overshadowed the lucky guess I made, in my mind anyway. No longer though! Right now I feel like the fucking **man**, thanks for helping me see the cloud's golden lining!",tifu

"New York- Mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while I was babysitting 4 year old step sister","Hi folks

I'm a 21 year old college student. My parents separated soon after I was born, and my my mom raised me alone until I was 15. She met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister Eliza. She's grown up with me, and I often baby sit for her for short periods of time. I live with a roomate in apartments owned by the College

Late last week, my stepfather's mom died. He's Polish, so my mom and he left for Poland leaving me to babysit Eliza for a week. Yesterday, I got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in Poland. I've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

I have no idea what to do. My biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. My mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the USA that I am aware of. I'm studying Political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but I have no job and no salary. 

Eliza has no family other than me that I can turn to. I'm not ready to take of a child, but I also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and I've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. But we also look very different- my dad is Jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. So I'm a tall, mixed race dude while Eliza is a small blonde girl (I bring this up because I was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

So what do I do? I'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and I haven't even told Eliza yet. It just hit me that we're now alone, and I now have to step up to the plate and take care of Eliza. I have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

Edit: Thank you for all you advice. I apologize if I do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

"My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. [NSFW]","[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

Which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos *for me*. The day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn. 

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that **I'M** the one who wanted it? 

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit: 

- yes, I *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. Just *mostly* everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend **DOES HAVE A PASSCODE** on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is *definitely* not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

You guys are being a little mean about this.

**Edit** (again): 

Went to the police and will update when I can.

## MINOR UPDATE 

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, ""I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor.""

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it. 

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",relationship_advice
AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?,"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.

My husband and I boarded an Amtrak train in Chicago on Saturday. Before the train departed the station, my husband suffered a heart attack and collapsed. The train doors were already closed for departure and we were unable to alert Amtrak staff. There were no emergency phones or emergency stop buttons available in the car. A fellow passenger and I were so desperate to notify Amtrak employees and prevent the train from departing that we attempted to remove an emergency window.  Between the two of us passengers, we were not able to remove the window. My husband and I were visiting from Japan so we do not have phones on a US network to dial 911 so we had to wait for a passenger to do so. The emergency responders did not arrive until 20-30 min after the event began - even though Amtrak Police officers were only 30 seconds away in the station the train was still sitting at.  So basically once the train closed the doors, there was no way to notify Amtrak of the emergency.

TIFU by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans," About three weeks ago, I began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who I'll call ""Ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

We live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. He's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. I thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt I get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. They are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

I ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. I used his email on the sign-up so that I could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

One small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. I sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which I mean I entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. I simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. I know how to do this because I'm a brilliant hacker (I googled it).

While carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING. I immediately noped off his computer, and of course I didn't open the email, but the damage is done. Secret's out!

My heart fell right through my butt, you guys. I actually died and now I'm a ghost writing this.

I probably should have pretended I never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but I was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. Within the hour I broke down and called Ray to sheepishly confess what I had done. He wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that I spoiled the surprise. 

Here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

My punishment for snooping is that the suspense is KILLING ME. I've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. Every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

A romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, I thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""Why would you think that I'm going to propose to you?"" He said. ""That sounds like something you wouldn't know about because I'd keep it secret IN MY PERSONAL EMAIL!""

Now he's started intermittently faking me out. The other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. He keeps getting down on one knee... Looking up at me... And saying, ""Gotta tie this shoe!"" The emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is MADDENING. Every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

One more thing: I somehow fucked up the email settings. The shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. So that surprise got spoiled, too. Turns out I'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

I guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and I do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

If we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

TIFU by looking up my school bully,"So a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when I was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. I struggled like hell because I didn't speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. So that's he kind of person I'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can't be that unfair. 

Fast forward 15 years. I haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn't make any friends and I didn't develop Stockholm's. I looked him up on Facebook. 

He owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can't get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed. 

TLDR: looked up my school bully and he is doing way better than I ever will.",tifu
TIFU by flashing my breasts...not realizing I was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.,"I've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""Early stages"" feels like I joke because I've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

As part of the hiring process for company X, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. It's a lot. I also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but I *really* hate my job. What can you do?

Anyway, I pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me I'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. To ensure I'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, I have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

Now, when I'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, I'm working from home for my current job. Because I WFH, I'm not always the most presentable. We're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. I look bummy. I'm a bummy girl who works from home. To be clear though, I'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

Anyway. I didn't take this into consideration when I opened up my computer for these tests. I *really* didn't take it into consideration when I opened up the program to begin the tests. I only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

And then...because apparently I have no shame??? I decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). This was a super sobering moment, guys.

I really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. So, I stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. While getting up, I haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. I took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. That's when I realized I wasn't wearing a bra (why would I be. I'm WFH, remember?), and the shirt I'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. I started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. I pull one out, put it on. Dig through my closet for that single shirt I was looking for. Find it, put it on. Bam. Ready.

I flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). Getting myself all situated, I went to push record to start the exam.

There was no record button.

Instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. It read something like 00:09:04.

It had been recording the entire time. The whole time.

Me cringing at my reflection? Recorded. Me smelling my sweatshirt? Recorded. Me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *Recorded.*

I had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. For an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

I can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when I realized. I definitely whisper-spoke  ""*Fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. Maybe a blacked out? I don't know. What I did know in that moment, was that I was royally fucked. The recorded video submitted when you closed the window. There was nothing I could do.

And then...because I'm a dumbass, guys. I went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

So. That's it. There you have it. I might now have nudes on the internet. I might get my recruiter fired for NSFW videos. Or, who knows? I might get the job.

TL;DR TIFU by not realizing I was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. I may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire HR department.

To girls who friendzone guys: they're not obligated to keep being your friend,"I say this as a gay man who sees this with many of my female friends. 

If you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. Some guys want to date you plain and simple. These guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. These guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. But it's not the same as a platonic friendship. If you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) Stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) Not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems. 

He's under no obligation to be your friend just like you're under no obligation to date him. This also applies to men who friendzone their female friends.",unpopularopinion

Reddit culture is cringey and fucking annoying.,"The ""thank you kind stranger"" shit, the comment threads that build on some reference or pun where everyone adds some kind of variation, the replies that are just a subreddit name like r/rareinsults and r/whoosh, all of it is fucking annoying. It's like watching poorly socialized people attempt to make some kind of ""cool kids club"".

I'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. Reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely ""oof"", ""yikes"", and ""le"" (""Doggo"" and ""pupper"" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). Expanding on what I said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. It's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",unpopularopinion
Unattractive people should learn to accept that they're not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.,"""Everybody is beautiful to somebody."" 

""Ugly doesn't exist."" 

""Everybody is equally attractive in their own way."" 

""Looks don't even matter. What's on the inside determines whether you're attractive or not.""

""You're perfect just the way you are."" 


These quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. It's like everyone needs to believe they're attractive or else. God forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

But... why? Is being unattractive THAT bad? Is attractiveness a person's only value to humanity? Are the lies necessary?

Sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. But alas, this is planet earth and life isn't fair. Some people are born with attractive features; some are not. Some are born with blatantly unattractive features. Yes, that's nobody's fault, but that's just the way it is. 

Before you say ""beauty is subjective"", you can't deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. For men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. For women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. Aside from certain fetishists, I've yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

Not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder ""what am I doing wrong?"" when they find that others don't view them how they view themselves.",unpopularopinion

AITA for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?,"Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

My girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

So basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

Well, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

My friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

I don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

My friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?

Please tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it. 

TL;DR: Apparently I'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

EDIT: This is epic.. I really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. Thank you to everyone that replied. I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

And to all women, I'm sorry our bathrooms suck. I'll be even more helpful letting others know about those stalls in the future.. having to pee really bad and waiting is the worst. Tiny bladder club!!",AmItheAsshole
[UPDATE] Someone I've never met claims they own my house," Hi everyone –
 
I can't thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: ""Someone I've never met claims they own my house"".  This is the first update, and I'm hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  This is what has happened since my last post:
 

After the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they'd been alerted to the Lis Pendens and could also represent us.  We were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  They said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. We hung up.
 

We looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner's title insurance (yay!).  Our deed is a ""Bargain and Sale"" deed, for those wondering. We also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  The last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  I signed up on ACRIS to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  I also emailed the DA for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  I gave it to him, but he hasn't called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
My husband met with our lawyer this morning, and I asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. Prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the Lis Pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  According to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  Our lawyer called their law firm and basically said ""Where is the deed?""  They supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we're starting to think they don't have it, and never did!  They may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who's like ""Yeah, I totally own that place.  I even have a deed for it.  No, you can't see it.""  It's possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

In addition, it's not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn't been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 YEARS AGO and there is STILL no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (I was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  Our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them ""You have no grounds for this.  Take it off.""
 

The attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on Friday.  I am hopeful that it will just be a matter of ""Take the Lis Pendens off."" And ""Ok"".  I'll update again after the call between the lawyers. I told my husband the number 1 question is ""Where. Is. The. Deed?""  When we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason I was freaking out. I honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  If they give us a hard time about removing the Lis Pendens, then we'll see.
 

So far my takeaway from this that I would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  And just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that's like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but I'm not bitter……).
 

Thank you all so much for your help,  I'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude.",legaladvice

What happened to my brain damage settlement?,"When I was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car I was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head.

I went through brain surgery, PT, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

I hate to bring this up at all but I know I was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. Im grateful to be alive and I don't want to be a money grubber, but I feel that was rightfully mine or at least I have a right to know the details. My parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet I'm about to be 23 and whenever I bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

Again I really hate to do this but I'm not a money grubber. Ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. It's just I want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money I don't know came from.

Update - Dog Ate Neighbor's Drone,"*Edit: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

A small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

I was served a summons by a Sheriff's Deputy, neighbor decided to take me to Small Claims over his drone. My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. 

He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). I don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they're investigating but don't know anything else. Not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do"". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. 

The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",legaladvice

I get a call on my phone and I hear an Asian woman ask for me, mispronouncing my last name, not unlike many telemarketers. Fed up with it I yell ""No, he's not here because he died!""

Not even two hours later there's a knock on my door, it was the sweet delivery lady and she brought a free meal for my household as a sympathy gift to help everyone through the ordeal of my death, while telling us not to worry about the bill from the other week.

I had my friend drop off enough money for both meals without explaining it because I felt so bad. I can't explain it to them without sounding racist and now I have to find a new Chinese restaurant.

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.

The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.

Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.

I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

[Original Post here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

This morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. Got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. The plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn't disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. Said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn't driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

We presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. Anything they found after they took ownership wasn't our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. We brought up the FTC's Private Sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are ""as-is"" unless otherwise stated. We neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

Long story short, the Magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the Plaintiff  because NC is a ""Buyer Beware State"" and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. They have 10 days to appeal, but I doubt that's gonna happen. 

Thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and I more information on the original post. It sure helped!

TL;DR: Magistrate heard the case, dismissed it because the buyer should have done more to inspect the vehicle.

I am so thankful for all of your comments - I read every single one of them! 

&#x200B;

So, what happened? Well, I realized that it is my wedding. My fiance fully understood my position and really likes my brother and thought it was a great idea. I organized a brunch with my current bridesmaids to explain my position and why I did what I did. I realized that it's a story I've told but didn't talk about with my friends, I thought it was abundantly clear that being 'different' from my family made it obvious. 

&#x200B;

The brunch was interesting. What I didn't mention in my last post was that the person who raised the most fuss was also someone who seemed to get the other people going more than they otherwise would have. We met for a lovely brunch at a nice place (my treat, too!) and I raised the issue once more. The person who was most ""disgusted"" by it, ""Ms. X"" again raised her objection. She was furious and said that this was a travesty and tried to rally the other girls. This time, there wasn't as much of a reaction and the others sort of just didn't care. I told them all why I wanted to honor my brother and why it was so important to me and Ms. X admitted that it was lovely and touching but it should be her because *it's her business!* Turns out that she wanted to be MoH and was going behind my back to get the other girls to drop-out of contention so that she could do it so she could plan the wedding and thus could be MoH/Wedding Planner and this would be for her business. I was a bit... surprised. Ms. X was so upset that she threatened to drop out of the bridal party altogether if this went further. Brunch was tense after she left but the consensus was, the other girls wanted her gone and I didn't want her around anymore either, so she's no longer being included (I will send her an invite). 

&#x200B;

That meant I had to speak to my brother. As I mentioned he's a doctor and has a dual practice, so I swung by his office and texted him that I really needed to talk. He misinterpreted my comments so he kept the office open late and his secretary/nurse/wife let me in. I went into his office and he was immediately worried I was sick, but I told him what had happened and why Ms. X dropped out and that I wanted him to be my ""Man of Honor"". He was totally surprised and confused. He asked if I was sure and that I really shouldn't feel compelled which is when I began crying (I had so much pent up emotion) so he made me laugh which meant I was snorting-laugh-crying which is my usual. He said he would be delighted but wasn't really good at bridal showers so he would need help. 

&#x200B;

We arranged a time for all the bridesmaids to come together and meet the Man of Honor so we are having a BBQ at my parent's place this weekend. My mom and dad are so happy that he's involved - my dad is walking me down the aisle and my brother will stand at the end. My brother offered a very VERY generous gift towards paying for the wedding so not only is he standing as the MoH but is paying about 1/3 of the wedding. We're really, really excited. 

&#x200B;

Interesting story: One of the bridesmaids actually knows my brother - this bridesmaid and I were friends at college and lived away for a while. While visiting home she developed some sort of nasty infection and was directed from a walk-in clinic to an emergency room where my brother attended to her and got her on her way. So there's a weird personal connection that they can talk about when they meet ""Hey, you lanced something somewhere! Glad to meet you again!""

People that sexually starve their partners shouldn't be surprised when they cheat.,"So the most common time this happens is in long term relationships.

Let me just say now that this is both men that cheat and women that cheat, not exclusively for 1 sex.

I see and hear about it all the time, a large complaint is that them and their partners are no longer physical or are not often physical (Months without sex at a time).

I understand that some people have different sex drives, however if your SO has said they they feel this way and you acknowledge it and nothing changes, that person shouldn't be surprised that the person would go outside of the relationship to look for intimate relations.

AITA for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant?,"My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

An's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

I am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of ""terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition"", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?

&#x200B;

**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

No, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

I will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.

Finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by giving a homeless guy $80,"Preface: 
*Not trolling for money, thanks* 


So I'm a semi-broke grad student and Lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. I ran into CVS to grab something and I was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). I also paid in cash which I never do as I rarely carry cash. So I walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man I often see in my neighborhood. I give him a dollar here or there some days when I can. He's in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so I figure, hey, even though I'm broke (as in my bills are insane and I make just enough atm to live and support my family) I can still give my coat because I have a few decent ones, I'm dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so I give him the coat and he mumbles ""thanks"" and I smile and tell him to stay warm and off I go... later as I'm working I stop to grab gas and realize I put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. I would never go ask for it back (obviously) but I had a moment of semi- panic before I accepted that I just gave this dude all that money. Best ""screw up"" ever, I suppose. I'll live. I have to be totally honest and say I was upset at first but I'll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that I should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke I FEEL.

Happy Holidays guy.

TIFU by falling deeply in love with my own smell.,"This didn't really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. This is a throwaway because I'm very embarrassed. Sorry about formatting, I'm typing this on mobile. My girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. It was a horrible event and I still haven't been able to get back into the game since. I was and still am very much in love with her. Now to the fuck up.

My favorite possession of all time is her pillow. It smells like her, and I usually sleep with it every night. I haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (I know, gross but I don't think straight anymore). I hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. But this morning when I went for a particularly long morning run I started smelling the smell. Really strong. It confused me but I wasn't going to start complaining.

This morning, about 20 minutes ago I arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. And the smell grew more pungent. This was the moment I realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, I got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. I'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell I thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

TL;DR- Slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.

About a week ago, I was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. We had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. So we picked up lunch and took it to my husband's work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.

We got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. Then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). Our kids loved it!

As we were leaving, I saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out ""hey, nice butt babe!""

Then it happened, my 3 year old yelled ""nice butt daddy!"" Which quickly turned into ""nice butt mama.""

I tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. I thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.

I was wrong.

Now, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;

""Nice butt papa"" (what he calls our elderly neighbor)

""Nice butt mama""

""Nice butt baby"" (his little brother)

I don't think we will be leaving the house today...

AITA for wanting a divorce from husband who lost 200k on bitcoin?,"&#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for 10 years. For our entire relationship, I have brought the majority of the money into the home. I contribute 75% of that. I don't mind, really. It's not something I think about and I have always considered it ""our"" money. Our country (Switzerland) is really expensive and I grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. When I had the chance to go to university, I studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. Years later, I make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.

We decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. I would check on the accounts every once in a while but, I haven't been checking regularly. A few weeks ago, I was thinking about buying a Model 3, since it has recently come to our country and I've fancied it for some time. I played with the numbers and while figuring out if I can afford it or not, I realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. There was 300k CHF/USD missing.

When my husband got home, I showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. This is about 25% of our savings. Besides being shocked and angry, I cannot help to feel that he stole from me. He put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. I was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. They think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. But I honestly just want to get divorced. If he is capable of doing this, how can I trust him ever again? AITA for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? AITA for thinking about divorce?

&#x200B;

Edit: To clear a few things. We always talked about where the money should go. What things to invest in, etc. I always thought he was really open about it and I trusted him... because he is my husband. I work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as I do. After going to work every day, making more decisions about money when I came home wasn't something I wanted to do. That's why I wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. Also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. I don't think that was clear above. So we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.

Edit: If he had doubled our money or ""won"" in some way, would I be feeling the same way? Partially. I would be angry for him not talking about this with me. This is a large sum, too large not to discuss. I would be happy because I would have more money. Who wouldn't be happy if they had more money in their home accounts? But I would have stepped in and taken control of everything because I see all of this as gambling and that's not what I would like to do with money.",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA if I don't attend my sister's $2800 per ticket destination wedding? *I do have enough money.,"My sister is having a Destination wedding in the Dominican Republic (all-inclusive).  It'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).
My sister would be very upset if I don't attend.  My parents say I should go, and that I'm being selfish for saying I'm not going.  

My sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   I don't make a ton of money, but I have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  While I really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. And less importantly, I have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as I don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

  In my defence, I've worked hard for my money and I sacrificed quite a lot to be where I am financially.  And while I have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because I earn a big salary. But, because I work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  The cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  It would also require me using a full week of what little time I get off work.

 I really don't know if I'm being selfish, cheap, and callous or if I'm being reasonable.   Last night I almost booked the ticket out of guilt, but, I couldn't do it and have since resolved not to go.  So what do you guys think?  AITA not wanting to attend?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke?,"I live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, I think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them.

TIFU by having my roomate walk in while I was practicing cowgirl riding...,"Oof

My roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on Sunday night. She usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

A week ago, I ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. I don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. So this was fucking fantastic and I was ecstatic.

My plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so I could sit on it and act like it was my bf. I'm not really experienced in the sex department and I wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so I was going to practice until she got back.

Before I get into the main event. I need to explain the layout of this house. When opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that USED to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. After leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

Since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. However since we got it fixed it's silent.

Now on to the main event. I had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so I could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. Then I pulled out my new toy and I literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

Then I got dressed down to what I would be wearing. It was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath I had my lingerie, I did this so I would be in the head space and so I could I imagine the upcoming day.

At this point I'm on the toy and I had a pretty good groove going and I was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so I grabbed some pillows to support, and then I heard a noise. I fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! I shoo'd him out and continued.

Another couple minutes go by and I can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. Until I realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. I then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and I felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. I heard the suitcase stop and when it did I hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. I was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

Lightbulb!

My shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! I sat myself right back down, turned the TV on Rick and Morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like I had been watching this the entire night.

She came in and saw me and asked why I was sitting like that and I made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and I was just letting it stretch out. She nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. Now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that I was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

We sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. She told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

At this point I'm so sore and by sheer will I'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

The moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. I reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. She does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  I pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


TL;DR: Tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

Update 1: Thanks so much for the lovely gold! It's my first one and it makes me happy! For the record, I am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. I haven't told my bf yet since I'm still a bit embarrassed! But I'm planning on telling him on the day. Also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

Update 2: Since it's being asked alot, the reason I was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. I was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. So there were boxes and all that jazz.

I started talking to this pretty good looking guy. He was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on Thursday evening. He looked exactly as he did on his profile (6""8' power lifter who looked like a legit Viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that I hadn't been catfiished but I was pretty sure I didn't want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. That said, he didn't seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so I invited him back to mine. 


It started well and I was like fuck YES, let's do this! So I said as much. I also said you're not going to call me back if we do this are you? He said he would. He's a liar. So bullet dodged. 


Anyway, he proceeds to pick me up like I weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (I'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. I'm like STRIP because I've gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. At this juncture, I realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but I figure babies come out of there so I'm grand.



There's a warm up wristy and a little Spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. It's over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so I open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he's just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. 


So I'm trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have I got a tissue? My first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. 


Blood.jpeg


So much fucking blood. Well, I know it's not a wild period since I'm not afflicted with that shit. I RUN to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. I'm like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. Meanwhile I've never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. 


We have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. I clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. Like it'll stop. 


Nope. Next day is agony and still going. Trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know I went on a date and I don't want them thinking I'm some harlot. I'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.


Wake up Saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. But like fresh, bullet wound type blood. And I felt so sick and dizzy. I'm freaking the fuck out. Obviously can't tell my Mum because catholic shame so I go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who I think thought I had been raped because I was crying so much because I've broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever I think for too long about how this is probably the last time I'll ever have sex and it wasn't even that good. Mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she's wonderful.


Get in to see the doctor. After a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged Asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that I have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. Brilliant.

Theres surgical glue on my vagina. I'm never dating again.

tl;dr: Had sex with a giant Viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.

EDIT: First, wow. I didn't expect this to blow up like this. Thanks for reading and thanks for the gold to those who gave it.

Second. To clarify, a Spider-man as I meant it is also known as the finger trick (middle and ring fingers in, the rest out, pull up repeatedly) although the PLAH!! Spider-man version is also great! Hope that helps.

[UPDATE] Does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? Oregon,"Previous post a month ago [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9g6uwn/does_a_child_who_didnt_see_one_parent_because_the/).

I'm safe, and I'm out.

I organised a place to stay with a coworker. I have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. My dad has some regular sport meetings on Saturdays that go for hours so I prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. I've been approved for a rental and I move there soon.

I contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when I told them he'd been telling me I couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

I took copies of all of his paperwork too because while I was getting ready to move I found most of what I knew about my parents separating was a lie. There was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. My dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when I was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. He's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when I'm 21. Some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. I think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. I did not find the letter I read when I was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

After I moved out my dad did try to contact the police. They came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say I couldn't look after myself. His words were that I was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

I've been back to Canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. We're still working out the details with a Canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but I have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people I remember. They were really worried about me when I went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

TIFU by swiping on lesbians on Tinder for 2 months.,"This has been going on for two months and I just found out today. Throwaway account because many know my real account and I don't feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

So I signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. I set up my account...set my interest in 'women' and started swiping. Now when I signed up for tinder I linked my Facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if I set my gender to woman. I had completely forgot. I'm not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but I was getting barely any matches and couldn't figure out why. Figured the algorithms were just screwing me. Over the course of the two months I would think ""wow short hair must be the new thing"" or ""so many bisexuals on here"" but never really thought anything beyond that. Then this morning I woke up to a new match. She said I looked great, to which I replied thanks, you too! But then she replied with...""how long ago did you transition?"" I thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. That's when it all came together and I realized I've been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

Tldr; My 13 year-old self is an asshole.

AITA for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.

Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

AITA for making my pregnant daughter move out before the baby is born?,"My 17 yo daughter (youngest and we had her late) is 7 weeks pregnant (she will be 18 by the time she gives birth) She is not in a relationship with the father. He reeaallyyy, I can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. I honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.

She has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. After she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby I asked her how she is going to manage that? This was the jist of the convo:

Her: I'll get a job. 
Me: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? 
Her: I thought you and dad could.
Me: absolutely not, I'm not raising another baby.

Pretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, I'm practically going to be its mother. I'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how I want to spend my retirement years. It's not fair to us. So I told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live. Husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing, I love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but I feel like we need to be united on this. I just want to know if  I'm in the wrong here.

AITA?

Edit: to everyone acting like I'm spending the next 7 months ignoring her- I will help her get a job, get on assistance if need be, find affordable housing etc. I just will not raise this baby.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic,"Throwaway because I'm still embarrassed and I don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

For background, I usually make the bed in the mornings, but I didn't yesterday morning because I was running late.

I went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. I got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. I checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and I just couldn't find her. Her wallet was there so I figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. I started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. I called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. I called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. My father in law told me to track her phone, so I went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. I turn on the find my iPhone sound and start running through the apartment thinking I should call the cops.

I hear the sound coming from our bedroom so I go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell I'm doing. Turns out the small lump that I thought was just a pile of blankets since I didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. She sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

I had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

Husband's Co-Worker,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years and together for 16. We are high school sweethearts. We just had our first child in August this year. I am 32 and he is 34. 

My husband works full time as a pharmacist, and I work at the power board. We have a great relationship, and rarely argue. He is my best friend. 

He took a position at a 24 hour Pharmacy as a staff pharmacist to train for a management position in 2015. This is one of the busiest pharmacies in our area. There are 15 technicians and 5 pharmacists including him at this location. They hired a new tech there that I will call Jane. She is 24 and married with 3 kids. I think she may have gotten pregnant with her third child after working there. Anyway she was a hard worker and my husband got along just fine with her and everyone there. 

However, she started texting him about work related things when he wasn't at work and started calling him Bossman. I was annoyed by her calling him that but I let it go. 

When I would go visit my husband at his work, she was always always overly complimentary to me. Telling me I was the cutest pregnant person ever, etc. I didn't think much of that as that is not my personality type but each to their own. She added me as a friend on Facebook and I accepted. I am friends with multiple coworkers of my husband both male and female. 

She began telling my husband about her marital problems. That she thought her husband was cheating on her, etc. She also wanted him to pick her up and take her to work when the weather was bad, she had car trouble, and other reasons. Now the current pharmacy manager does all this, so my husband didn't see an issue with it. So he picked her up a few times when the weather was bad. 

Fast forward to May of this year, my husband gets promoted to pharmacy manager and Jane wants to transfer to his store. She picks up all the extra shifts there. I'm still pregnant with my daughter and this point, and so I go see him one night. She straight up avoids me. I try to speak to her to be nice and she ignores me. So I ask my husband, he shrugs and says he don't know. 

The texts start increasing and it's more non work related stuff than work related stuff. She starts tagging him in things on Facebook and I am uncomfortable with it. So I tell him to put a stop to it. The final straw is she asks my husband to pick her up at a car dealership and take her to work since her car is being serviced. Keep in mind that her husband works at the dealership where her car is being serviced and they have a vehicle each. That's when I lost it and put my foot down. 

Well she no longer wanted to transfer to his pharmacy after he told her the texts and asking for rides had to stop. She basically went silent. I was still fuming and friends with her on Facebook so I posted a meme and she deleted me. She did not block me just deleted me. 

She told everyone at work that I didn't like her and she just didn't understand why and she wasn't transferring to his store anymore because my husband didn't like her. 

My husband had to go back to the store she works at to take care of something and he didn't speak to her, she went to a coworker and was on the verge of tears because my husband didn't speak to her. 

So anyway she gets a new job at the hospital and leaves the pharmacy. I'm so glad to be done with her and the fact my husband will never see her again until she tells another coworker at that Walgreens who I am very good friends with that she is coming back on 1/10/19 because she doesn't make enough money at the hospital and has filed for divorce from her husband. I'm not too upset by this. He rarely ever has to go to that store and will never see her. 

Well on Friday we got news he is going to be promoted to manager of that store and his first day there will be around the time that Jane starts back working there. I trust my husband completely but I just don't know how to handle this situation.  They will be working together every day. 

Now I realize that a lot of this stuff happened while I was pregnant and hormonal but I just have a bad feeling about all of it. 

Any advice is appreciated, and I'm so sorry for the long read. ",relationship_advice

People obsessed with sports are just as nerdy as people into video games or dungeons and dragons.,"Title says it pretty well. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge sports fan, I like teams in the NCAA, NFL, and MLB. I follow them all very closely. I am a nerd because of that. I sit alone and watch games and yell and carry on, but so many people are in denial about this.

There are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing. That should garner just as much criticism as majoring in psychology, gender studies, and sociology. Those degrees are completely useless if you don't get a job like selling tickets for your local college team.

We all know someone who is that ""sports are my life guy"" 

Also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or D&D are these sports nerds. There's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

Again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. Sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it. 

Edit: getting a lot of replies because I included psychology, I have a psych degree myself just saying if you don't go to grad school it doesn't help much finding jobs.

TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I'm turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",tifu

I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.,"Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""Sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",relationship_advice
TIFU by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life,"This is long so TLDR at the bottom.

This happened around 6 years ago when I was in 9th grade. I grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. My parents never taught me anything about genitals and I apparently never asked, all I knew was that's where the pee came out.

So one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. I was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. By that time I was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

So armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work I went home and a few google searches led me to discover that I had a severe case of phimosis. So being the pragmatic young buck that I am I also google how to fix it. There were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. Not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel I opted for the latter option. I got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

After about 4 hours of stretching I finally started making some progress! I could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. Everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell I've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. It dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. I kept stretching over the course of a few days and I started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as I stretched. Some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as Dick Cheese. 

I cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. That was about to change real fucking fast.

So this was about 10 days into my stretching and I'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. I was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so I got very impatient and I decided I'd try to force it all the way back that day I lubed and got to work, I pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. I pulled it till I couldn't bear the pain anymore. I did this over and over again for around 3 hours until I somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. I got way too excited and despite the pain I gave it one big yank and I felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. It hurt like hell but I was just so relieved that I didn't care. I opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. The entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. That was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where I tore the top part of my foreskin when I yanked it over the glans. I freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. It eventually stopped and then I had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. I eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. I was still hurting but I was finally done. I got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. I thought that was it. I tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so I just left it.I completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. You know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? That's how my penis looked. I went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

When I got home I was still in major pain so I decided I'd check on it. I undressed in the shower and looked down at it. The first thing I saw were the blisters. Two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. The next thing I noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. I'm a black guy.

I realized that if I didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. I lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. This was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. I kept trying to force it back over and I put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  My penis was on fire at this point and I was holding back tears but I kept pushing until I felt it pop back over the glans. Judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain I felt I guess the second blister popped too. Once again I left it and fucking went to bed. 

I checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. I rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks I was pretty much ok. My foreskin was still tight and I do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

Also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. Even if they aren't as stupid as I was don't take that risk lol

TL;DR; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because I got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

EDIT: So I didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

So while I'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, I'd like to clear up something. This post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. Circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  Rather, I'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

For those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. Don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. They have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. For those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. Believe me it's not as awkward that you think. Don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like. ",tifu
I [59M] cut two of my kids [24F][28M] out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. How should I fix this situation?,"My (now deceased) ex-wife and I have 5 kids together: 21F, 24F, 28M, 30M, 35M.

A few years ago their mother passed away and left each of them a very large inheritance. Over 300K GBP each, evenly distributed among them.

Prior to her passing she made it clear to them that this money was not to be wasted. It was to: 1. Used to pay off debt, 2. Used to further education, 3. Put towards buying a house in future.

Two of my kids, 24F and 28M, have completely squandered this money in just a couple of years. My daughter spent it **all** travelling across the world care-free staying in nice hotels and eating fancy dinners. I completely understand going on a vacation, **but to blow all of it on travel against her mother's wishes?** Bloody shameful.

My son is even worse. He has literally spent it all on drugs, alcohol, and escorts over this time. None of it, **none**, going towards self-improvement as their mother wanted.

So I continued to hound them over this time and time again until, as expected, it's all bloody wasted. Once this happened, I decided to cut them both out of my will, as I don't want my hard-earned money being squandered so my children can live a hedonistic lifestyle for a couple of years.

I told this to their siblings in confidence, so that they would be prepared to deal with the fall-out when I eventually pass. One of them (not sure who) let it slip to them, and now they've gone off the deep-end and proclaimed I'm ""dead to them"" and they ""don't have a dad"" etc.

I don't want to go into a long bitter fued with my kids, but damned if I'm going to have my life savings wasted by them also.

"AITA for telling her to ""Know her place""?","Throwaway account cause several friends know my main account.

&#x200B;

I (F27) have been friends with a guy; Steve since I was 12. There is a group of us - and key point is that I am the only girl. I don't really know 'why' I'm the girl of the group; but I am. Outside of my recent ex; Tom, of 3 years, I have never once liked or been liked by any of these guys. I am not a ""pretty"" girl, and I describe my taste in clothes as 'meh'. I'm not fashion savvy or makeup savvy, etc. Let me say this again - Steve and I have never touched beyond hugging. The most intimate we've gotten was probably him carrying me home when I broke my foot once.

&#x200B;

About 4 months ago, Tom and I broke up, and at the same time Steve began dating this girl Abby. Abby is beautiful and knows all the things that I wish I knew about being a woman. So, upon meeting her, I was warm, friendly and was even asking for fashion advice when I met her. I wanted to be her friend. Abby was quiet, and not as warm, but I put that down to shyness.

&#x200B;

Last night Steve, Abby, Tom, myself and a few others went out for dinner and drinks. I continued being friendly to Abby, while not really having a response to that. I went to the bathroom and when I came out of the stall Abby was standing there waiting for me.

&#x200B;

I'll cut a giant argument short, but Abby accused me of breaking up with Tom to get with Steve and told me that she will do whatever she has to do to get rid of me, stating that it was ""super weird"" that I was the only girl friends with a group of guys, insinuating that I'd slept with all of them, but then also implying that I should have left the group when Tom and I broke up. My response to this was to tell Abby to 'know' her place and that I had been around for much longer than her, and that if anyone was going to be ""gotten rid of"" it'd be her because we had been through the jealous girlfriend situation before and Steve had chosen me, and would never seriously consider a girl that hated his best friend.

&#x200B;

Abby went out and told Steve I attacked her - who didn't believe a word and broke up with her on the spot. Since then, I've gotten messages from Abby's friends on social media to tell me what a whore, bitch, slut, I am and that Steve and I were fucking the whole time. One girl even sent these messages to my family to 'warn' me about what kind of 'slut' I am. My own brother says he feels that I've caused this drama myself by

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Extra info as required:

Holy shit - didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. And I did not expect gold at all - so thanks? 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I did mean 27 in the post - I failed to mention that Abby is actually 22; but I do highly accept that I could have handled the situation much better; I am NOT a confrontational person. I grew up in an abusive home (in particular from my step-mother and step-sister) and my general response to conflict is tears (which I hate) or just bolting and ghosting a situation. I think being ambushed is why I lost my cool. 

&#x200B;

I read a lot of comments about how this came off as ""not like other girls"". I don't know how to not make it do so. I'm simply not ""good"" at being friends with other girls. I'm shy, awkward, I stumble over my words; and because I \*want\* to be friends with them, it comes off as desperate and overdone. I do have girl acquaintances but it never goes beyond the occasional coffee time. 

&#x200B;

Boundaries - I'm not a touchy-feely person outside of if I'm actually in a relationship or seeking a relationship with someone. Again - childhood abuse. Once we got out of high school and stopped seeing each other as frequently - we do a quick side hug goodbye. 3 of the other guys have girlfriends who all seem to enjoy my company when we are together. 

&#x200B;

Somebody mentioned that I'm obviously into my friends if I got with Tom. Tom and I kissed as a joke once, sensed the chemistry and things went from there. We all thought it was going to be forever - but Tom got some bad health news and put ""us"" on hold until/unless it ends positively. He doesn't want to put me through that. 

&#x200B;

The long version of the argument began with Abby asking why I was wearing such an inappropriate outfit for someone who'd just broken up with someone (jeans, boots and a shirt); I stared at her in shock and said ""what the fuck - what's going on?"" and then she straight away started with the accusations. 

&#x200B;

As a last note - the previous girlfriend of Steve's happened when we were about 16; and when that happened, I stepped back completely and began distancing myself from everyone. It was about 2 weeks before Tom of all people got it out of me and he went to Steve and told him. I offered to leave the friendship and not make their lives a burden or whatever the words I said were, and they all said ""No, she's in the wrong"" and that any girlfriend who couldn't/wouldn't understand I was a friend/sister was not the girl they wanted to spend time with. This was repeated to me this morning when I showed the messages I was getting from Abby and her friends. I was apologising profusely (and for my part in the argument - telling her to 'know her place' which was such bad wording on my part - I know) and was told by Steve ""well she obviously wasn't wife material then"". being friends with these guys for so long and that I should have stuck with girls instead, or ended the friendships once we all started dating in high school. He also feels that I'm leading on any man I'm with by having male friends who they then have to question constantly if I have or am sleeping with. So - AITA?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for expecting my daughter to help her brother?,"Me (50sM)

My daughter (32/f)

My son (27/m)

I love my kids equally.  

My daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  We don't charge her rent and so she's built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

My son is a bit more aimless.  He has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  He supports them (gf doesn't work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  They have lived in Airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

Last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  Apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  There's no way he'll be able to pay that off on his current job.  He has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it's going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  Meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  The debt will inevitably grow with interest.  My wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

I don't want my son to file for bankruptcy.  It would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  I believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  When I pass all my children will have is each other.  They should learn how to rely on each other more.  

I told my daughter I think she should loan son the money.  She got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  Her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.

"META At any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.","This seems like a really weird meta post, but I just wanted to warn people that Captain Sparklez, a YouTuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole Trails episode talking about this sub. It's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

It seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. The thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

This isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. Honestly I knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds I know to this day. But it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. Take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

I *am* the asshole, I already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. Sorry, teenagers, but I kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. I wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but I would also be looking at their advice differently if I knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Just be careful everyone. And please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. This doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes.""

My (24f) co-worker (50f) blamed me for my miscarriage but is now frustrated I won't talk to her,"Exactly what the title says. My coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because I was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( I took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why I'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but I'm coming and going 'as I please'.


Me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that I had a miscarriage. Her response? 'I told you you were pregnant! Why the hell are you here? You need to be home! This is why you had the miscarriage! You don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. What is wrong with you? You are being so stupid! You don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. Come on, really. Who do you think you're telling this to? I'm a woman! I have gone through things like this! Don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. Honestly, take care of yourself. '


And then with that she announced she was going on break and I sobbed in the bathroom. I pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. Then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but I've moved desks. I'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. Today she tried to send me a birthday gift and I refused. She is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. She also tried to coordinate breaks with me. I, of course, insisted that I break at a different time. 

This is making her frustrated and I am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why I no longer want to engage socially with her. I am completely amicable to her professionally otherwise. How do I explain to her I don't want to be friends with her anymore? Is there a way I can do it without causing her to 'explode'?

TLDR: worker got upset for getting yelled for being late to work, tried to come up to me and asked me why I didn't get in trouble, I explained that I miscarried my pregnancy and she blamed me for overworking myself and causing the miscarriage and that I shouldn't be surprised if I can't get pregnant again.

"[NE & CO] My mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. Can she do that?","For some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. She has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since I've moved out for college. She demands access to absolutely everything I have. This will be important later.

&#x200B;

I'm 18 years old, and I'm a college freshman. I go to college in Colorado, but I was born and raised in Nebraska. In Nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. It was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. Like I said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when I do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200B;

My mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200B;

Recently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200B;

So the question is this: can she do that? Is the Fugitive Slave Act not dead after all? Does my having autism change the circumstances any? If all else fails, what can I do to protect myself?",legaladvice

My son has moved back in with me last weekend.

The older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

I got a phone call from my son on Saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

I jumped into my car and brought him home. I also yelled at the man and told him I'm calling the cops.

I then called an officer I knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

When we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

So while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

I'm happy he is rid of that predator but I'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

I have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

I hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

AITA for making Gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?,"So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

I've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

Well, it didn't stop. 

Anyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

The noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH! followed by snorts and the like.

So far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. His audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor Gargoyle rears its ugly head.

TIFU by chuckling away being overpaid.,"Obligatory ""this concluded today"" - I've been working for Uncle Sam for about 7 years now. I'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day I received a letter from DFAS (the guys who actually pay us) that I was overpaid two whole cents.

Silly I thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which I could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, The man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - It was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

Laughing it off I taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom I work for and why I should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you F-35), and forgot about it. A month later, two weeks ago I get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address XXXXX, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

Now I'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before I ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now I'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. Being the Class A humorous guy that I am, I send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, I kunted et al myself. I lobe me job."" Covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

This was a bad play because apparently Feds have no sense of humor.

Two weeks later, one week ago I got called into my officer's office. Not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, I was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

I'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""[me], mind explaining to me why I received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

"[Manitoba, CANADA] (UPDATE) My cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.","Previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

My cousin and I want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. He couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. Thank you so much! This situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

Now for the update: My cousin is moving out this weekend. He spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. Also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. The landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. My cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. Needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. After an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. The landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

Anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for June, July, and August, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. My cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. Luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. He is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with James ever again.

While my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. He was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. My cousin and I honestly feel bad for James as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. Still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

And that is it. Thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. Take care, you beautiful people.

EDIT: Since I'm getting nasty messages, I figured I should edit this to let everyone know that I have finally convinced my cousin to report him. He will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is Saturday. We are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. Also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of June 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

There you go folks. Please stop insulting my cousin and I.",legaladvice
My (22F) twin (22F) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. Don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23M) of 8 months.,"This has happened with every single guy I've dated or been interested in. I've only had 3 relationships before my current one with ""John"". My twin sister ""Sarah"" has tried to interfere with all of them. 

Two of my ex's cheated on me with her. The third we broke up for other reasons but Sarah still tried to seduce him. He was a good guy and always had boundaries with her, but that didn't stop her from trying. To the point of sending him nudes multiple times then claiming ""oops wrong person"" when he told her he wasn't interested.

When that didn't work she also tried to break us up by lying to my ex and our mutual friends that I was cheating. My ex didn't believe her but some friends did. So yeah that was fun to deal with...

Then, when we were kids like in middle/high school, if Sarah found out I had a crush she went after the guy herself. I used to tell her those things because well, isn't that what sisters do. She always used it against me. I told her I was working up the courage to ask my crush/ the guy I was ""talking to"" to prom. She then asked him and he said yes. She said he'd just been using me to get to her. Another time a few years before that she announced to everyone in a class we shared that I liked this one boy who got bullied a lot. Kids then started teasing him even more and he hated me. I felt horrible for months, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. She also once told a teacher who's class I was doing bad in that I was into him and willing to do ""favors"" for better grades. That got reported and I had to go through this whole counseling thing before it was finally cleared up. It was extremely embarrassing. My sister just blew it off as a prank.

There's so many other situations like this, she either gets guys who are interested in me to sleep with her or ruins my chances with them by making up bullshit to make me look bad. She's ruined some of my friendships lying about me too (told my best friend in high school I was gossiping meanly about her and went so far as faking text messages.) I don't know if she even actually wants these people for herself. You might think it's obviously jealousy but sometimes I honestly think she just gets a kick out of messing with me.

Anyway I've finally got my life more together after wasting the first couple years of college on being depressed and a gaming addiction. I met my boyfriend ""John"" at a campus organization. I haven't told Sarah, but he ended up meeting my parents by accident today. I don't have much contact with them but they decided to come for a surprise visit... they live over 5 hours away and do this a few times a semester even though I've said I don't like it. But that's for another post. John was in my room with me when they got here. I had no choice but to introduce them (he knows I was holding off on having them meet because I don't have the greatest relationship with them)

Sarah lives at home with my parents while going to college locally. I'm certain they're going to mention meeting my boyfriend. And then cue her insisting on coming with them the next time they surprise-visit me. Also stalking my social medias to try to figure out who he is.

I've tried to explain the issues I have with her to my parents. They think I'm over reacting, they say she just wants to know what's going on in my life. To be involved. Yes that is the problem...her involvement. 

And, not to mention we used to be closer before I lost trust in her to stop doing this shit, so I've seen what her own life is like. She does things my parents have no idea of. She takes party drugs sometimes. This wouldn't be a big deal but she has no idea how to be responsible. She drives people around while drunk and high, my parents think she's with a friend studying on weekends but she's actually clubbing in the city and then crashes with her friends for the night. I'm not sure how many real boyfriends she's had but she's hooked up with a lot of guys the same night she met them. This has meant a few times she was scared of pregnancy. I've had to help her get Plan B. It sometimes feels like she sleeps with nearly any man that smiles at her, and told me she's even had ""sex"" with a few girls while wasted however that's possible... she confides all these things to me, but whenever I need someone to talk to she has no time. Never wants to hear anything unless she can save it as ammo. So I've gradually stopped telling her most things.

If my parents knew all this they might see where I'm coming from, it's not just random that I don't want her meeting my boyfriend. It's not because I want to hurt her or something. The problem is, our parents are really strict and traditional, and they'd probably kick her out if I told them any of that. They don't believe in sex before marriage. My boyfriend is the first person I've had sex with, and I'm afraid my sister could use that against me to them if she finds out.

So what do I do? How can I keep Sarah from finding out about him and doing the same thing she's done with all my past boyfriends? How do I explain it to my parents?

TL;DR: my sister has a pattern of interfering with my relationships. She's gotten guys to cheat on me with her. My parents accidentally met him today and will probably tell her. How do I keep her away from him?",relationship_advice
AITA for teasing my wife about finally catching her shitting?,"Ok so this is kind of a weird situation. My wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, ""See! I knew you shit too!"" She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again.

Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

Edit: Welp, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I guess the general consensus is that I am TA, so I guess I'll try to tone it down for now until she has more time to calm down over it.",AmItheAsshole

My (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22M) tried to spike my drink.,"This is a throwaway, my boyfriend also has a reddit account. I am sorry for how long it is but please read this, I need advice. 

Updates at the bottom of the post.

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now and started hanging out with his friends, all guys, a few months after we started going out. There is usually at least 4 of us at one of our places, drinks, snacks and music every friday evening. My boyfriend is out of town for the weekend and the guys invited me anyway. We were at the friend in question's place, let's call him S. S has always been very nice to me, a bit flirty in the beginning but I just brushed it off and it didn't last long anyway. He plays guitar and I play instruments as well so we always show each other our compositions.

So yesterday when I went to his place, there was another friend and everything seemed fine, we were drinking and hanging out until around 1 am when other friend says he's heading home as he works on saturdays. Not wanting to make anything awkward and as everyone was a bit buzzed, I say I should leave too to talk to my boyfriend and let him know I'm home okay. S says I should stay a bit more as he wants to show me the last piece he wrote, I agree and sit back on the couch. S brings his guitar then asks if I want something else to drink, I tell him I am okay and he insists he has an amazing whisky that I need to try, he then goes to the kitchen to bring it. In the mean time, I start heading for the toilet and catch a glimpse of him dropping something in my drink, it dissolves and he smells the glass, I quickly close the toilet door before he could notice me. Now I was tipsy but still very aware of my surroundings, and I am 100 percent sure of what I saw. He brought the two glasses and kept watching me, not knowing what to do I ""accidently"" dropped it, apologized profusely and said I should really head home and l started heading for the door. S grabs my arm and is very insistant I should stay, he keeps telling me I should spend the night, how my boyfriend doesn't need to know, that I am really hot and how horny he is. I push him and run to the door then call an uber and head home.

I don't know what to do from here, I couldn't sleep all night and I keep imagining worse case scenarios. I don't know if I should tell my boyfriend or if he would even believe me and how he would react, I haven't heard from S yet and I don't know if I can even look him in the eyes. All I know is I am not going to be able to act normally and I am sure my boyfriend will know something is wrong. I really need some advice.

Edit: Update actually, Thank you for the comments, the advie was very appreciated. I called my boyfriend and told him everything. He believes me and he was very supportive over the phone but hr is very upset, he says I should have told him right away and that he's coming back to ""beat the shit out of him"" and insists we go to the police. This is basically what I was afraid of, I am pretty sure he's going to go to S's place directly, he is 2 hours away. And I can't stop him because it's not like I can go there myself, but at least he says he is here for me.

Second Edit, another update: Thank you all for the wonderful advice and support. We're going to the police station, I am writing this on our way, I am terrified and it's late, this has been a tough day but my boyfriend has been amazingly supportive although he is very angry. We agreed that we wouldn't contact him directly and bf said he would call his other friends to let them know after we talk to the police. This is going out of proportions and I am honestly shaking while writing this but I hope this is the right choice. I am still scared to ruin someone's life over this and I don't know if anything will be done but you guys were right to open my eyes that he might have done it to someone else or will in the future. My bf is very adament on taking it in his own hands if the police don''t do something so I hope they can and I will make another post when an update is necessary. Thank you again, I would not have done this without the support here.",relationship_advice

AITA for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?,"I've known James since we were 11. He's been my best friend for a long time and we're so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike AND even share a last name. He lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

I had a crush on him growing up and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined and said we were just best friends. He's really goofy with me, and treats me like I'm his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he's family. 

A couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I've always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I'm in the right place in life and I'm so happy. 

When James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. Won't go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn't feel like going to the mall, can't come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

My mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one I cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. He confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. He said 'I know it's really weird of me but it just creeps me out' 

I found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and I haven't heard from him since. I'm so upset that he's ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump!

It's even worse because he has cheated on me once before with her, but as far as I knew they haven't been talking recently. I asked him about it and he tried to brush it off but I was being jealous and insecure and I couldn't let it go. He walked away from me and told me ""I can't talk to you when you're like this"". I just cried alone in the living room and than after a while he called for me to ""come here"". I did and he pulled me onto his lap and told me to stop crying and he wiped my tears. He told me that he can't control what she says, and told me that he only loves me. He told me, ""she's not like you, I couldn't be with a girl like her"". I told him I was sorry and he nodded but than he just stopped smiling and freaked out on me all of a sudden. He pushed me onto my back on our bed and he put his hand around my throat and started choking me. He told me something like ""just a warning though, nobody likes a jealous woman babe"". I tried to put my hand on his to move it but he whispered ""don't be stupid"". He just stared at me until I surrendered and then he eased his grip. He told me, ""I don't want you to talk to me like that again, okay?"". I told him yes and he let go of me. And then he told me gently to take my clothes off. I said ""what?"". And he told me again to take them off but this time he tapped my throat with his finger and told me ""I don't like asking twice"". I just did what he said and I said sex with him. It wasn't angry sex or anything, he wasn't very rough. If anything he was more caring and passionate than usual. After that, he was nice to me the rest of the night and has been today. I just don't see how he acts like everything is fine when I have bruises on my neck. Maybe I'm being crazy but he just scared me. I just don't understand him. I know he shouldn't treat me like this.

META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world,"I've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. They'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. They'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that's fine. But in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? People who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. I don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Edit 2: Wow, this got very big. It's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

And alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. Academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so I might have a warped view on this one. 

Edit 3: I've never seen this movie, but it's come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: ""You're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole""",AmItheAsshole

[Update 3] My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea.,"So I want to start out by saying think you for all the support. Most of you guys have been great with the exception of a few trolls calling me a cuck. 

So I came home the next day after staying the night else where. She didn't really say much to me other then hey and went back to messing around on her laptop. I went up stairs and put my things in the guest room and layed down to take a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before. She came in and asked what I was doing and I told her that until she's ready to sit down and have a adult conversation about the name that I would be sleeping in here. She rolled her eyes and said that she thought I had got over and asked why I even bothered to come home if I was going to act like this. I told her because it is my home and I'm not going to miss out on time with my son just because you don't have the ability to tell right from wrong or atleast admit it. She stormed off and that was that for that day. 

The next day she I came home from work and she was on the couch waiting for me.  She asked what it was going to take for us to get back to normal. I told her that we would need to see a marriage counciler first off and consider changing our son's name to his middle name. The look of rage on her face when I said that last part was something I don't think I've ever seen before. I hate to say it but it mad me a little happy to see it. She told me to go fuck myself and that was never going to happen and stormed off. We didn't talk the rest of that day.

The next day rolled around and my wife hadn't gotten home from work. Someone started knocking on the door and it was her parents. They said we need to talk so I invited them in we sat down. They said they know what she did was wrong and they always knew and so did her whole family and all her friends.

TIFU by ignoring my hot coworkers open invitation.,"Obligatory this didnt happen today, but yesterday.

I lifeguard at a local indoor pool. Theres about 6 lifeguards including me, and 5 of them are guys. Theres 1 female and she is like smoking hot. Any 18 year olds fantasy. Shes like 23. 

Yesterday, it was just me and her at work, and she asked if I was doing anything later. I told her I was probably just gonna play video games or something and she asked me if I want to go to the arcade with her. I said yes, under the assumption we would go as friends. Would I ***want*** to go on a date with her? Absolutely. But I knew im way out of her league and didnt want to embarras myself. Regardless, the plan is set. After work I would meet her at her apartment and we would to go the Arcade in our local mall.

I go home and shower, change clothes, get ready etc. I drive over to her apartment and text her, she tells me her door is unlocked and to come in. I walk in, and shes in her bathroom doing her hair in her bra and underwear. I kinda back out the door, but she tells me to come back in, and that I always see her in a two piece swimsuit. Touche.

She's getting ready and were just talking about work and she lays on her bed and says ""My neck is killing me.. I need a massage!"" I kind of laugh, and then she asks me If ""I give good massages"", while giving me this look. Heres where the fuckup occurs:

My dumbass says ""I think theres a massage kiosk at the mall where the arcade is!""

10 seconds later I realised what I just did. 

She sighed and finished getting ready silently and we went to the arcade.

She was practically silent the whole night. The next day at work (Today), she didnt mention anything of it.  I still cant believe I cockblocked myself.

Anything I can do to have the footage deleted?","Some friends and I met up in Southern California to have a little weekend together since we all live in different parts of the country. I brought my girlfriend with me and so did a few of my friends. The weekend went how it went and on our last day there we noticed there were small hidden cameras speckled through the home. After checking the bedrooms we confirmed there were in fact 2-3 cameras in each room all pointed towards the beds. I contacted the hosts and they stated that its their home and legally they can have security cameras in the home. Is there anything we can do to have the footage deleted or something? I understand the need for security cameras in case of damages or stolen items, but being pointed at the bed in all the rooms? It makes me feel really uneasy.

"My truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. [WA state]","My truck ('87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid October. I immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

Fast forward to last Friday, I receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... On November 1! Six weeks prior! From my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

I called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. A later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which I would think is illegal. Apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but I had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. I had no idea it had even been recovered!

All I really want is my truck back, which I don't think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. Am I entitled to compensation? And from whom? The towing company sold it before it's stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. Do I have legal recourse here?

I have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their ""complaint hotline"" until tomorrow. Same situation with the towing company.

My husband plays favorite to an extreme with our sons,"I am 29 and my husband is 33. We have two sons together, our older son is six years old and our younger son just turned five a couple months ago. 

Our first son is more outgoing and energetic while our younger one is very quiet and sweet. I will call them A and J for this story.

My husband strongly favors A. He's always happy to see him after work. He plays with him, he talks to him. He goes to all his soccer games. He's a good father with him. But to J, he barely looks at him. The most he gets is a short ""goodnight"". He'll scold him for little things like spilling water, and that's the most attention he gives him. He gives him very very little affection. The last time I saw him actually try and bond with him was on J's birthday. A is obsessed with his father, but J doesn't blink an eye if I say something about him. He looks at me like he doesn't know what I am talking about. J is very nonchalant toward his father. I can tell he notices the coldness, I see the look in his face when my husband is drooling over A. When he is home, he just sits quietly playing with his toys.

He doesn't really raise his voice or hit J, he's not cruel just so cold and distant. My husband is a more a cool and calm person, and strict even with A but he does show love when he wants to. It really bothers me, deeply that he would treat his own child like this. I feel like crying. The only thing he is equal with our sons in is gifts. But I really need him to change things. How can I talk to him about this? I have brought it up to him gently before but he only brushes me off. 

My husband doesn't like to be questioned so I am nervous but I need to protect my son's emotions. He is getting older and I am afraid of how much this will hurt him. And has hurt him. I want to know what I can do.

[Update] From the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on Christmas,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  My girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

I posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. It got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and I was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. Gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and I fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the Big Talk.

Little did I know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. I didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. So Thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, I got a dreaded ""WE NEED TO TALK"" text. Yep, all caps. And I was like ""welp, I'm dead.""

She was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). Still, she said I had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and I agreed/apologized. She knows I'm writing this update and she's going to read it before I post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

We talked for a long time Thursday night. She said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. It's partially a cultural thing, according to her. Gf was born and raised in the U.S. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. She said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class Americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. Gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. She grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

On top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. She said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. Gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. She also got very little affection from her parents growing up. It seems like that was all replaced with material things. So, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

All that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. She was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. She was really hurt that I said I thought I was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and I said I was sorry, and I am. I was still raging a little when I wrote that. I asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. It wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

We've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. I'm totally fine this. We've been together for almost 3 years and I think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. She's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. We spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. It's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. I'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. No one can change their habits overnight.

We're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. The plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. She also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. It's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. We're going to give it until my lease is up in March (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. She isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before March.

tl:dr: Thanks, Reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. I did and I think things are going to get better.

EDIT

To everyone who's wondering, her parents are from Mexico.

Gf has a job and her own income. She is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

Also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on Reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. You're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. In that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. That's now just out there for the whole world to read. You can't say that wouldn't be alarming. She said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. All things considered, I think she was pretty reasonable about it. Ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure I thanked Reddit for the perspective. No, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. She's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",relationship_advice
Purchased a laptop from a guy on craigslist and found CP on it. I am being told that calling the police is a bad idea because I am the one in posession of it.,"Basically the title. Bought the laptop from the dude at his home in his drive way. After 2 hours I found the CP on it and shut it down immediately. I wanted to call the police but I am being told that that is a terrible idea as the Texas law regarding it is stupid as fuck. They said that I would be the one charged as I am the one in possession of it and that the creator of it would face separate charges. 

Am I going to have to get an attorney for this or is there a way I can report this without one? I am pretty broke and can not afford even 100s for a consultation fee. 

Is my friend right in that I would be fucked if I called the police?

I am not going to provide many details here other than I am not in trouble, so far, and that I only gave information about how long I had the laptop, how long it was before I found the CP, and handed over copies of all documentation. I had my old cell phone on me and recorded the audio of what happened on it for CYA. 

I was tempted to just wipe the device when I first found it as I felt like I did not want to lose the 200 I paid for it. Yes selfish I know but at that point I did not care. My conscience got the better of me though. The police have it now and I have records of everything in case they decide to bust down my door over this. ",legaladvice
Ex-wife's new wife is attempting blackmail,"Background: I transitioned to SAHD for several years when my wife began work as an attorney. We mutually agreed to a divorce a couple years ago and remained close. Because I'd put my own education and career on hold for her, plus a fair amount of debt accrued based on trying to make my ex's plans-on-a-whim work so that I could stay near our kids, I'm starting from rock bottom. I've lived with my in-laws for quite a while as I'm finishing my long-delayed BA while trying to transition out of retail and into better-paying work so I can afford a place of my own. She started a relationship with a woman, ""Judith,"" in the finance industry who offered to mentor me into entering the industry as well. Neither my ex nor I realized that Judith was giving me misleading advice while badmouthing me to my ex and her business contacts. A few months later it came out that Judith was manipulating and physically abusing my ex. My ex ran, but she decided to return after a week. Since then, Judith has made infrequent contact with me via text and email, swinging between attempts at intimidation and playing nice. I currently live in upstate NY with the in-laws. My ex, her wife, and the kids live in MA.

The incident in question happened a couple weeks ago. Judith sent me an email saying that she was giving me 30 days' notice to move out of the in-laws' and into a new place. (I had been open with them, before Judith's behavior came to light and after, about my financial situation and how I was finally saving enough to move out early this year.) If I'm not out by that time, Judith said, she'll tell my in-laws that I was emotionally and sexually abusive to their daughter (my ex) during our marriage.

(EDIT: Her threat was slightly more subtle than that - it was basically, ""Would her parents continue to let you live there if someone told them this? Probably not!"" And in the immediate follow-up email, ""You have 30 days to get out."" So it may not be quite so cut and dry. Otherwise I would have probably just gone straight to a lawyer or the police.)

Because the context is internal to a family situation, I'm not sure how or whether the law on coercion applies. I've briefly looked at the coercion statutes for both NY and MA, as well as the federal statute. I may have been married to an attorney, but I don't know enough myself to even figure out where jurisdiction would lie in this situation. I don't know what steps I should take or when.

TIFU by trying to buy an Instant Pot at Target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist,"This started yesterday but I didn't realize my FU until today.

Yesterday, I stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt Instant Pot at Target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. I decided I would get some Christmas shopping done early and flip a few. I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

Well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can't find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. I step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the State Police Counter Terrorism Unit and they start questioning me about why I'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if I know what they can be used for, if I'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the Target parking lot. I did my best to explain the price mistake and how I found it, etc. I think they accepted my explanation but I'm still nervous that I'm on a watchlist now.

TL:DR tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 Instant Pots at Target, got interrogated by State Police Counter Terrorism Unit why I was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

TIFU by not correcting my cashier when she mistook me for a coworker.,"Today was my first day off work since Friday last week and I decided to run some errands. While I was out I ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store's EFTPOS was down. The cashier told me that they could still process the sale, I just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. 

On my drive home I realised that I had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so I swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. I got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. 

I'm a person with anxiety so I always prepare something to say when I'm inevitably asked how my day is going. I knew that I was going to respond with ""good, it's been pretty busy although I had a sleep in this morning since I was at work so late last night"". I got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went ""oh, are you not working today?"" and I just panicked. This wasn't what I had prepared for. So my stupid brain decided to go with what I had already prepared and I said ""nah I was working late last night so I'm not in today.""

The second it came out of my mouth I wanted to hit myself. Why didn't I just say that I didn't work there? Sure I could correct her now, but I'm already in too deep. 

So we start talking about work. She complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. For some reason I say that I'm lucky that I'm not working since it looks like it's a busy day. She asks me if I've heard anything about Shaun leaving. I said that I heard he is. She was upset about that, he's a nice guy. I agreed, he's one of the good ones. I have no fucking clue who Shaun is. 

I manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. We get to the point where I'm about to pay and what do you know, the EFTPOS is down.  Part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, I simply explain to her how to process the sale. Information I only know because I was at the other store two hours ago! 

She looks at me and goes, ""well at least someone who works here knows what they're doing."" I laugh nervously. Yeah...right. 

Then she asks me for my staff card to scan for ""my"" staff discount. And of course I don't have a goddamned card. Who do you think I am, an employee? Luckily since I had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse I managed to come up with a lie about how I didn't have my full purse so I don't have my card. That's alright though, she can put it through on hers and I can sign it. 

I signed a name that definitely wasn't mine. Is that illegal? Probably not. I then picked up my bags and ran. Didn't even say bye. I needed out of there. 

As I hurried away, I heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, ""did you know her?""

I don't think I can ever go back there. Either I'd have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. So I think I'll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. 

TL;DR: Cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. Instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. I got in deep enough that I was teaching her to process sales. After she gave me her staff discount I fled the store and now don't ever want to show my face again.

Edit: wow thanks for the silver! And because a few people have asked, yes I am in therapy. I have been on and off for almost ten years. I suffered from abuse for the majority of my life and while 99% of the time I'm perfectly functioning I do still have a compulsive need for people to like me because that it something I deem safe. Hence my inability to rock the boat by telling her that she thinks I'm someone I'm not. That could end in an unsafe situation and in those moments it's not a risk I'm willing to take.

Edit two: and some golds! Damn if I knew you guys enjoyed anxiety fueled fuckups then I'd have been sharing my dumb stories ages ago.",tifu

TIFU by forgetting my weed butter in the fridge while my parents staying in my flat,"It all happened this morning.

I´m a student  in Cologne, Germany. My parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat. Yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. My dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. Next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. She woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. I couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. So my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some Wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). After a few minutes I started eating too. I took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. I had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. We made way to much of it so I kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. Yeah.. so I took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the Wurstbrot. I was shocked and felt like frozen. I didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on. My mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. I asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. So I started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. My mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. For her its a real, hard drug.My dads reaction was pretty chill. He started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. An hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. He started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to Amsterdam. I am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! Cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.As soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. She is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought I would never do drugs. My dad told me she would calm down soon. They drove home a few hours ago.I think I never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. Its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!

TLDR: My mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. My dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.

EDIT: So my mom called me today. She apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. She told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. She has absolutely no relationship to it. She said that she is proud of me and that I should be carefully with smoking weed.   
Thanks for all the likes, comments and awards! Didn't expect that to happen. I try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed.",tifu

City government lied that our water was safe. We paid for our own test and it proves the water violates the EPA Safe Drinking Water Act. What do we do now?,"Our water quality is directly linked to the amount of water being used. The more water the city pumps from the aquifer the higher the radium numbers rise. Our city had been testing the water only during our city's lowest usage days.

A member of the city paid for an independent water test. The results violate the EPA's Safe Drinking Water act.  

Anytime someone has gone to city council meetings and asked for the water to be rechecked they were literally told to shut up and sit down.

Can we have a class action lawsuit? How do we force the city to join the nearby cities water system that does have safe drinking water? What can we do?

TIFU by accidentally giving my entire family an indirect unholy facial UPDATE,"Two days back, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ael0wt/tifu_by_using_holy_sanctified_oil_as_lube/) happened.
Here's the **TL;DR** from it:
Used oil as lube, accidentally shot semen into the bottle. Turns out oil had religious incantations recited upon to ward off evil, and grandpa will be using it tonight on his hair and beard.

Right after the post, a lot of people asked me to throw the oil away but I hesitated because my grandpa had apparently been feeling better ever since he started using the oil even before I came in it, so I didn't know how to waste it. I could've asked the Imam (Local mosque leader) to do the same stuff he did on the oil in a new bottle, but he's out of town for this month. So I just put the bottle where it was and he even used it once right after, unfortunately.

Next two days, I stayed over at my cousin's place and just got back this morning. Right as I came back, Mom recommended me to massage my hair with the oil given by the Imam as it felt ""soothing"". As she was saying it, I visualised my demonic jizz nuclei laughing and slowly sliding into the bottle, and then being mixed in it throughout. I snapped back, and acted like I wasn't convinced to do it. She told me it was my choice, and that everyone in the house (Parents, grandparents and siblings) had done it and felt better. I rushed to the bathroom to check the bottle because I couldn't believe what she said, and the bottle was nearly empty with the slightly bubbly end left over for me. I froze over the realisation that each of my family member had used my mayonnaise infused sanctified oil on their faces and hair, and I haven't been able to look at any of them in the eye ever since I left the bathroom. 

Not sure if I should tell my brother about this now, or keep my mouth completely shut at this point. 

**TL;DR**: Came into a bottle of sanctified oil, delayed disposing it off and now my entire family has used the oil on their face and hair

So today at school I decided to talk to her and see what made her do what she did. And I must say i was sure surprised when she said it was just something that other people have told her and she was curious if it was true. So naturally I asked her why and she literally told me ""just because"". So then I asked her if she was aware of how uncomfortable that made me feel and how it hurt my feelings to which she just said ""sorry"". After that I really just lost it and went home to sleep. It really didn't go as i planned or wanted it to go, but i did learn some things if nothing else. My until recently ""best friend"" isn't really the best nor even a good friend. How blinded could i have been? Anyway, her behavior answered some of my questions without even having to ask them and i'm pretty sure I just wanna stay away if I can and distance myself now. And yeah that makes me mostly angry than anything else but I can only hope these emotions will go away slowly. I guess those damn romcoms are a lie after all :)

I (28M) ruined my girlfriends (23F) family's favorite movie and now they hate me,"For the last year and a half I've been dating a girl I met through a friend. We get along extremely well- we both love movies, the same music, stand up
comedians, I'm an avid filmmaker and she likes to edit- everything has been great. 
She's not from around here and we decided to fly out and have me meet her family for the first time. It's been going relatively well in my opinion, but tonight we decided to watch their favorite movie: The Fourth Kind.
For those that don't know, it's an alien abduction movie that tries to act like all of the events are 110% true. I'd never seen it so they wanted to show me. Halfway through the movie her dad said something along the lines of ""I wonder why this wasn't a big deal when it happened?"" To which I said ""well the movie is fake- them saying the events were real is a bunch of shit."" 
Apparently for the last 10 or so years they've believed that the movie was true. The whole family immediately freaked out at me- her dad kicked me out of the house and now I'm waiting to fly back home a week and a half early. I've tried to call my girlfriend but she hasn't said anything to me yet. What should I do to remedy the situation?


Update nearly 24 hours later: girlfriend and I have talked- her and her family got in a huge fight after I left and came home. Apparently her dad was mainly upset of my Polish heritage (they're Swedish so I guess there's bad blood there? I'm not too caught up on that) and me pointing out that The Fourth Kind is fake was just kind of the tipping off point. She agrees that her family is kind of crazy too.

TIFU by peeing all over my first kiss and immediately legging it,"Not today, about 9 years ago. This story is one that stills keeps me awake at night begging for death.

**BACKSTORY**

I was 15, just an awkward high schooler from the suburbs of Melbourne. I wasn't popular by any means, but I had a few good mates and while none of us had a girlfriend, we were always full of bullshit stories about our sexual conquests. ""Oh, she's from another school you don't know her"", ""It was on holiday"", ""And then her friend joined in"", etc. Between us we must have fucked half the female population of Australia before hitting 16. But in reality all of us probably would have killed each other if it meant a shot at ditching the V plates.

Anyway, as the school year's finishing up and everyone's gearing up for Summer, there's talk about some of the popular kids heading out of town on a bit of a camping trip, out on this king-of-the-jocks types cousins farm. Everyone wanted in. A big piss up away from adults filled with the hottest girls from our year? Come on. If us boys could score an invite we'd finally be able to prove to each other just how much game we had.

I wasn't so naive as to actually bother asking for an invite. There was no chance of us getting a look in, we simply did not have that kind of status. But then, on the first day of the summer break, one of the guys hits me up with a text; ""we're in, pack your shit."" Fortunately for us, his much cooler sister from the year below ours had been immediately invited, and through the age old art of sibling blackmail, he'd wrestled the details out of her. It wasn't an invite per se, but we knew where to go and I doubt we rated high enough to even bother asking to leave.

Due to the nature of the impending debauchery, we had absolutely no interest in our parents catching on to the vibe of the trip and decided to get ourselves there. An hour and a half on the train out of town, a bus ride and about a thirty minute walk later we arrive at the campsite. It wasn't really a farm, it was just this massive property that made money as a sort of backup scout camp most of the year, but the owner was letting us have it for the weekend while it was empty.

We shouldn't have worried about not getting an invite, it seemed like half the year level had rocked up. Looking back I honestly have no idea how a group of 14-16 year olds got their hands on as much alcohol as they did but this thing was **stocked**. We were on some *Project X* shit, a whole bunch of sex crazy teenagers out in the sticks drinking themselves stupid. This was my first experience properly drinking, and despite my apparent long list of sexual conquests, my first time really hanging out with girls.



**THE PISSENING**

One of the great things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down social barriers and make you realise that most people are actually pretty cool once they drop the act. One of the terrible things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down urinal barriers and make you realise that no matter how recently you took a piss, you're gonna be busting for another in no time.

For example, late into the evening, I found myself sitting on a log, alone with a girl I'd never have had to balls to speak to before. A classic popular high school girl, way out of my league. But here we were, her downing vodka from the bottle, me sinking tinnies (of sweet, sugary, girly cider).

Things get a little blurry, but I remember getting increasingly closer and closer until we were making out. We were pretty awkwardly positioned on this log, and in an attempt to disguise my own overly excited log I was sort of leaning forward with my arm tucked into my stomach. My elbow was pushing up hard against my bladder. I suddenly became aware of a desperate need to pee, but I wasn't gonna be a fucking idiot by ending this action to get up and go empty the tank. I needed to be stoic. I could pee when I'm dead.

My unwelcome rock hard guest was at this point making a pretty good go of trying to break free from my pants, and this girl could tell. To my teenage delight, rather than retracting in horror she didn't seem to mind and decided to work with it. Unzip. Pull free. Spit in the hand. She knew what she was doing. But the unrelenting excitement that should have been my first handjob became sheer panic as I felt the flood gates reaching breaking point. Within milliseconds, the thought left my brain and travelled south.

Before the words ""oh shit stop"" could leave my mouth I became a human Super Soaker, releasing a veritable Niagara falls skyward into the small space between us. By the time she'd pulled away in drunken horror, my liquid fury was all over both of us. Her face was contorted into a mixture of confusion and rage, and before either one of us says anything I'm on my feet running for the hills, attempting to tuck my still flowing hose away. She's yelling after me, ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"", as people look over at the chaos.

After hiding away in my tent for a short time, king-of-the-jocks less than politely told me that it was time for me to leave and to take my guys with me. They were not impressed. I called my dad to come and pick us up at two in the morning. He was not impressed. As for the girl? The reputation that followed me around school for the following three years makes me think that she was, in fact, not impressed. 

**Tl;dr** Things were getting a little wild post my first make out sesh with a hot girl, but after foolishly ignoring my bladder liquid gold rained down on the both of us and I ran like the wind. Got myself and my mates kicked out of the party of the year, and had my dad drive an hour and a half out at 2am to pick us up.

Edit: Thanks for my first ever (non liquid) gold!

Edit 2: To all those asking about my ability to take a piss while standing to attention, I dunno what to tell you. Is it a super power? Am I broken? We may never know. But I can safely say that I don't partake often due to urine related ptsd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Follow up:** Thanks for all the kind words, I'm glad this harrowing moment of adolescence made you laugh. I can't reply to all the comments but to those asking what happened to the girl, I don't think we ever spoke again but still saw each other in classes and stuff, just forever avoiding eye contact. As for my group of mates, it didn't take them too long to forgive me, and it eventually just became one of those story's that is brought up at every possible opportunity. I still get roasted for it.",tifu
