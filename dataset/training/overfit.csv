Ketchup is fucking disgusting,"A proper hamburger or cheeseburger should never have ketchup. It dominates the flavor and all you taste is shit. If I want to get the tomato profile, I will put a fucking tomato on my burger and not some pasty, corn syrup, sugary sissy bullshit. Every burger place puts ketchup on the burger by default, so I have to always ask for no ketchup and have the chance of them fucking it up. You ketchup fuckers should have to ask for ketchup, not me.

Putting ketchup on steak should be a capital offense and you should be sent to a reeducation camp. 

It's fat dumb people sauce. Its the keystone or natty light of sauce. Its putrid odor is reminiscent of filthy hooker perspiration. You can literally judge a person by how much ketchup they consume. Ketchup kills more people in America then terrorism and drugs, yet we don't have a War on Tomatoes. The world would be better without ketchup.",unpopularopinion
AITA [25] for telling my sister [19] that being a stay at home mom isn't a career plan?,"My sister has never put much thought into how she's going to afford to be alive. She doesn't have ambition.  
 
Ever since she was little, when asked what she wants to be, she'd jokingly answer that her plan is to be a stay at home mom. She's still saying it, but now she isn't joking.  
 
She doesn't even have that much experience with kids! She's never baby sat. 
 
Recently she's been telling family members she's going to nursing school which is amazing! I wanted to talk to about it and praise her.
 
I visited home last weekend (she still lives with my parents) and asked her what her plans are — in a sisterly way not in a ""this is a setup to lecture you way"". She said she's been lying to the the family and that she plans to keep working her minimum wage job until she meets a man she wants to settle down with. From there the conversation went like this: 
 
Me (irritated): there are no Prince Charming in real life, Rosie 
 
Rosie (irritates): yea ... I know ... I'm not looking for a Prince Charming. I want to find a man to raise up.
 
Me: but you are. You want someone to come take over your life because you don't have the motivation to do better on your own. If your whole life's goal is to find a man to love you, it's going to push you into the arms of the wrong kind of man. Also, how are you gonna ""raise up"" a man if you can't even raise yourself up? Do you want to be like mom? 
 
Rosie: no! I'm not going to be like mom! I'm going to do it better! I saw what she did and now I can do better! 
 
Me: well do better but improving yourself before you get knocked up. You don't remember but from 8 until 13 I watched you and (brother) every night while mom partied until 3 because she got pregnant too early, didn't have time for herself, and resented us. That's going to be you.  
 
My sister was crying at this point said fuck you, and left. 
 
My dad overheard and said I was too rough and she didn't need to hear all that. 
 
I think I was justified. Sometimes you have to be mean to get things through a person's head.

TIFU by accidentally posting a topless picture on social media.,"This actually happened today! I put my 16 month old to bed at about 7:45. At 8:45 I checked his video monitor and was surprised to see him wide awake. He was creepily staring into the camera with his eyes whited out by the night vision. I took a screen shot of the video and posted it to social media. I typically have the camera zoomed in so you only see his crib, but if you zoom out the rocking chair next to his crib is in frame as well. I just usually can't see it. This is relevant. 

Here is where I fucked up. The monitor detects crying and grabs a 5 second video when it is detected. These are located in a queue at the bottom of the screen with a thumbnail for the video. After a bit I get back on social media and happen to review my post. The thumbnails are visible in the screen shot and I'm very obviously topless and sitting in his rocking chair in the very first thumbnail  (just got out of the shower and hadn't put on clothes when he started crying) I have no clue if anyone caught it, but it was super easy and clear to see. I completely forgot that you can see more of his room than just his crib. My brain will now spiral out of control all night while I ponder who has seen my boobs tonight. 

TL;DR Posted a screen shot from my sons video monitor not realizing that you could see a clear thumbnail of another video where I am topless.",tifu
AITA for asking a fat lady to give up her seat to a late pregnant mother and her SO,"So I was on the bus yesterday and it was packed. But this lady was so big that none was able to sit next to her. Now I had a seat on the bus for a while but as a student I give up my seat to other people as thats my schools expectation. But the entire time i had been on the bus this lady had been sitting in a 2 person seat by herself. Now when I get on its already full with many people normally standing and it really got on my nerves that this lady had the audacity to take up 2 seats. But when a lady who was deep into her pregnancy and her SO got on the bus it really annoyed me. after 2 or o minutes and no one had offered them or her alone i worked up the strength to ask her if she would get up and give her seat to the couple.

&#x200B;

Thats where i stuffed up. So i asked her politely if she would give up her seat so the lady didn't have to suffer with the pregnancy as badly. (Something along the lines of ""Excuse me ma'm would you mind giving up your seat so the lady over there could sit down so its a less unpleasant experience for her, if you could i'm sure they would greatly appreciate it)

&#x200B;

Apparently this was super rude and she got really offended and started shouting that i was 'fatphobic' and rude and that she would report this slight to my schools headmaster and get me suspended or expelled.

&#x200B;

So reddit AITA.

&#x200B;

\-ok then i'm an asshole it though what i was doing was good but it turns out she probably had justifiable reasons for the 2 seats.

"UPDATE: Un-permitted contractor next door did $5,000+ of damage to my home, contractor and homeowner won't pay or provide insurance information","Hi r/legaladvice. Just wanted to provide a ""thank you"" for all of the responses and an update on the situation detailed in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atin99/unpermitted_contractor_next_door_did_5000_of/). Basically, I'm a homeowner in Philadelphia, PA, and a contractor working on my neighbor's house caused a leak that led to a lot of mold and water damage that needs to be repaired, and the contractor and homeowner have ghosted.

&#x200B;

Since so many people suggested we file a claim with our homeowner's insurance, I gave that a shot. However, according to the adjuster I spoke to about our claim, our policy apparently has an exclusion for ""faulty workmanship"". Even though it's completely insane, I was told that our insurance company would not cover the damage or provide any legal assistance because the damage was caused by someone doing work on the house next door. The adjuster told me this is a very common clause in insurance policies. Basically, all insurance companies are completely manned by psychopaths and capitalism is an endless nightmare that will surely swallow us all.

&#x200B;

So now it looks like I'm back to square one. The police have suggested that I try to find information about the contractor and homeowner through the Licensing and Inspection Department to pursue legal action, but previous attempts at that came up with basically zilch aside from a suggestion to hire a lawyer. So I guess I'll try and find a lawyer that will take this case, although my previous attempts to reach out to lawyers about this issue have not been promising at all.

&#x200B;

Going forward, are there any additional avenues I should pursue? My insurance company (Farmer's by the way. If you're thinking of going with them I might suggest drinking poison instead) is completely worthless. The two lawyers I've spoken to seem to have absolutely no interest in taking up a case, one of them specifically advised against hiring a lawyer because of the relatively low cost of the damage, the amount we'd owe in legal fees, and the fact that cases like this are rarely paid out even when they're successful.

&#x200B;

It's been a bleak couple of days, but thank you all for your responses earlier and wish me luck.

Edit: ...Uh, whoa. I'll be responding to pertinent comments as I'm able, but being a dude with a 9 month old, it might be pretty slow going. Thank you all so much for taking the time to respond, and a big thanks to the mods for removing the lock on this post!",legaladvice

"Parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl","I've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. My parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

These girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

I'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but I feel they still need to be taught that. 

And same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

Edit; If a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. Self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. He definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

Same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. If that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

This post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. That way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. Men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",unpopularopinion
TIFU by seeing my mother's porn.,"My PC sits next to my Stepdad's laptop in the living room. My cat likes to jump on the keyboard or the laptop and lay on it.

"Found Hidden Camera in AirBnb (Seattle, WA)","My bf and I are staying at an airbnb in Seattle, we're basically living in the bottom unit (basement) and the hosts are directly above us. Everything seemed fine. Last night I went to use the charging cube and cable they had in the kitchen, for some reason it wasn't charging my phone so I took a closer look at it and saw that it was blinking. We shined a flashlight on the cube and realize it was one of those hidden camera charging cubes. It was in the kitchen but pointed straight at the bathroom, which means it has footage of us undressing (completely naked) and walking into the bathroom to shower. 



The hosts never informed us about this and we are really uncomfortable with the fact that it has footage of us without our consent. We contacted Airbnb but they are not super helpful and now we are considering calling the police to file a report. Is it legal for us to take the files from the cube (direct USB connection)? 


update 1: We called the police non emergency line, they won't give us an ETA or when they are coming but we have to wait for them. We only have 2.5 hours left until we have to check out . . . so I guess we will sit tight until then

Update 2: the couple left and went somewhere while we waited for the police. The police eventually did show up, made a report, took the camera as evidence, and tried to get a hold of the couple but couldn't. All my messages between myself and the host were wiped from the Airbnb app, I did not screen shot them but have copies of what the host said in my email. We are going to Mt Rainier for the next two days so I will keep you guys posted after. 

Update 3: Airbnb messages are back and I have full access now, will screen shot and keep safe! Thanks for all the advice and support, I'm just glad the police came and took care of it from there. Will look into lawyers once I'm back. Entering mt rainier now, will update later. 

Update 4: the host has contacted me and apologized stating that they did not know it was a camera and that some other guest had left it behind, they seemed a little upset and offended we would accuse them of such things. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that what he said was true. Airbnb refunded me the entire stay without me even asking and have temporarily suspended the host. They are starting their investigation and will communicate with the police. The police are still trying to see if they can get data off the device and are still doing their investigation. So that's where I'm at, it'll probably be a while before anything happens so I will make a separate update post when everything is settled. Thanks for the support everyone, it's been pretty terrifying and now I'm paranoid at every place I stay but I'm trying my best to just think of it as an isolated incident! ",legaladvice

TIFU by making people think I'm in an incestuous relationship with my mother (NSFW),"So today my mother and I did our weekly shopping. I accompany her most weeks as it's usually the only time we get to spend each other at the moment with our schedules and everything else.

It began as a normal journey and everything was going absolutely fine until we reached the end of our list and began to unload everything onto the conveyor, we had everything we needed except some batteries that my mother had forgotten to write on the list and only just remembered as we were going through the checkouts. Not a problem though as they were on a stand at the end of an aisle. I offer to go and grab the batteries enthusiastically enough that I mishear when she tells me which type of battery she wants. 

I had heard the word Duracell but not the type, and so I don't go back and ask what she wants, I wait until I am by the battery display, turn around and see my mum on the other side of a busy crowd of people. It's Christmas so of course people are everywhere.

My mind goes completely fucking numb for some reason and my wires get seriously crossed before I open my mouth to shout out across the store ""Mum, what kind of Durex did we want again?!"" It didn't even register that I had confused Durex and Duracell until the many horrified looks piercing me like daggers, none sharper than my mother's who I'm still unsure what to say to at this time. 

TL;DR - I yelled across a busy supermarket to ask my mum which kind of durex we want instead of which type of Duracell we want and we  were looked at like freaks by everybody as we left.",tifu
Michigan. I was denied a restraining order because my abuser said I'm kinky and because of my sexual history.,"In October, in the process of getting out of an abusive relationship, I filed for a restraining order and filed a police report and gave evidence such as text messages in which my abuser admitted to doing it. I gave the same copies of texts to the police when I filed the police report.

At the protective order hearing, his defense was that it was consensual because I have a sexual history involving BDSM, and that I was simply trying to ""punish"" him. We did not have that kind of sexual relationship, and hearing the judge asking him questions about my sexual history was extremely upsetting. They were laughing and joking about how ""you'd think it would be the other way around"" that I was a more experienced submissive than my ex was an experienced Dominant. I brought a eyewitness but the judge did not want to hear from my witness at all. He said it sounded like a ""bad breakup"" and gave me a restraining order for a few weeks as a ""cooling off period.""

Today I found out that the prosecutor is charging him. I know that there is a higher burden of proof for criminal charges than there is for a restraining order, so surely I should have been granted an actual restraining order, right? I want to know if I have any recourse for how the judge acted during the restraining order hearing, because it definitely put me in danger, and I worry that others will be put in danger too. I don't care about trying to get money, I just really feel like this is not the series of events that should have occurred. Is there anything I can do?

Also, do I have to worry about my sexual history coming up in court? I'm really hoping the prosecutor won't allow it.",legaladvice

AITA for not paying for an equally extravagant wedding for my oldest daughter?,"We have two daughters, Jody who is 26 and Hanna who is 28.

Both of them are engaged to two wonderful men who we adore.

My wife and I have saved roughly $50k for each daughter as a wedding fund. We aren't rich people so it took us years of being careful with our finances to help pay for half their college and this wedding fund.

We sat down with both my daughters separately to talk about their wedding plans. They did not know we had a fund for them. This was probably our first mistake.

Hanna immediately said she did not want a large wedding and would rather save money for a house deposit. She was going to do a courthouse wedding followed by a reception next year. So my wife and I agreed we would give her the wedding fund for that purpose. Again, we didn't communicate any of this with her. A huge mistake in hindsight.

Jody wanted a decent sized wedding. Something the fund would've covered.

My wife and I decided to pay for several of our family members from out of the country to attend. We knew it would be expensive but we knew we were only having one traditional wedding and we hadn't seen some close family close to 20 years.

Unfortunately, the costs started going out of control and we ended up taking $15K out of Hanna's wedding fund to cover the difference. At the time, we felt ok doing this because the extra costs of the wedding were due to our decisions, not Jody's.

The wedding happened a few weeks ago and it was perfect.

The problem now is that Hanna is aware we paid for most of her sister's wedding. She isn't aware about the costs and that we had to use some of her wedding fund.

A week after her sister's wedding, she came to us and said she changed her mind after seeing how beautiful it was. That she too wants a wedding like that with all of our extended family.

My wife and I had to tell her there was no way we could pay for all the extras again because we thought it'd be a once in a lifetime situation. We told her we'd be giving her around $35k for a house deposit and hosting her reception at our home.

Hanna had a complete meltdown and accused us of playing favorites. She left in tears.

She is now telling us she's too busy to meet for dinner or lunch when she used to drop by a few times a week.

This situation has now reached other members of our family who are chiming in.

This has been killing us. My wife told me we should just take the other $25k-30k from our savings to make this smooth over.

A part of me agrees but a larger part of me is angry that we have to mess with our retirement just because Hanna changed her mind. And I know part of her decision change is because of the constant competition our daughters have had growing up. 

AITA for thinking everything should stick to the original plan? My wife disagrees with me.",AmItheAsshole

My [33 M] wife [32 F] hit me at a family BBQ. Everybody laughed.,"I don't think I'd ever felt more pathetic than I did at that moment. We'd gotten into an argument. She wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). I'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. I didn't think I should drive. My sister was also urging me to go. She was standing right there when my wife hit me. It was square across the face. I'd just told her there was no way I was driving since I'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. My wife called me an asshole... Then wham...

My sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. Everyone around us laughed. Maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but I can't say for certain. Nevertheless I felt humiliated.

The thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. It started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). It was infrequent at first. She was always super apologetic. Over time it escalated. She started throwing and smashing things. Screaming. Berating me. Hitting, kicking, and punching me. I don't even know how it got so bad. It just is and I feel trapped. Who in their right minds would believe me? Who would ever think she was capable of this? Sometimes I feel like I'm hallucinating it all and I'm just losing my mind. She was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? I don't even know.

Now people do know and it doesn't even matter. It's funny. I'm funny. It's so fucking funny. Look at him getting hit by his wife. So damn funny.

I want to disappear. I would if it weren't for my kids.

I don't even know what my question is. I don't really have one.

Is even possible to come back from this? I wish I could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

TIFU by not correcting my cashier when she mistook me for a coworker.,"Today was my first day off work since Friday last week and I decided to run some errands. While I was out I ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store's EFTPOS was down. The cashier told me that they could still process the sale, I just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. 

On my drive home I realised that I had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so I swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. I got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. 

I'm a person with anxiety so I always prepare something to say when I'm inevitably asked how my day is going. I knew that I was going to respond with ""good, it's been pretty busy although I had a sleep in this morning since I was at work so late last night"". I got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went ""oh, are you not working today?"" and I just panicked. This wasn't what I had prepared for. So my stupid brain decided to go with what I had already prepared and I said ""nah I was working late last night so I'm not in today.""

The second it came out of my mouth I wanted to hit myself. Why didn't I just say that I didn't work there? Sure I could correct her now, but I'm already in too deep. 

So we start talking about work. She complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. For some reason I say that I'm lucky that I'm not working since it looks like it's a busy day. She asks me if I've heard anything about Shaun leaving. I said that I heard he is. She was upset about that, he's a nice guy. I agreed, he's one of the good ones. I have no fucking clue who Shaun is. 

I manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. We get to the point where I'm about to pay and what do you know, the EFTPOS is down.  Part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, I simply explain to her how to process the sale. Information I only know because I was at the other store two hours ago! 

She looks at me and goes, ""well at least someone who works here knows what they're doing."" I laugh nervously. Yeah...right. 

Then she asks me for my staff card to scan for ""my"" staff discount. And of course I don't have a goddamned card. Who do you think I am, an employee? Luckily since I had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse I managed to come up with a lie about how I didn't have my full purse so I don't have my card. That's alright though, she can put it through on hers and I can sign it. 

I signed a name that definitely wasn't mine. Is that illegal? Probably not. I then picked up my bags and ran. Didn't even say bye. I needed out of there. 

As I hurried away, I heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, ""did you know her?""

I don't think I can ever go back there. Either I'd have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. So I think I'll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. 

TL;DR: Cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. Instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. I got in deep enough that I was teaching her to process sales. After she gave me her staff discount I fled the store and now don't ever want to show my face again.

Edit: wow thanks for the silver! And because a few people have asked, yes I am in therapy. I have been on and off for almost ten years. I suffered from abuse for the majority of my life and while 99% of the time I'm perfectly functioning I do still have a compulsive need for people to like me because that it something I deem safe. Hence my inability to rock the boat by telling her that she thinks I'm someone I'm not. That could end in an unsafe situation and in those moments it's not a risk I'm willing to take.

UPDATE: AITA for not adhering to the wedding dress code,"So I posted about a month ago about my sister requesting I wear a long sleeve ankle length black dress to her lakeside wedding in summer, while being 9 months pregnant and I've gotten many requests to update 


Well, I ended up having my baby like 3 days after making the post so I was in the hospital when the wedding happened, so I didn't go. My sister was there when I pushed her out and apologized for being a bridezilla so all is well and I have a cute baby.

Sorry that this was an anticlimactic update but I give the people what they want.

WIBTA for asking my wife for a paternity test on our son (5 years old),"When my son was born, he had a dark skin complexion. Wife and I are both quite pale in complexion. Now originally I thought, this is common in babies at birth and maybe as he got older maybe something to do with the pigmentation (right term?) would change and his skin colour would look more like ours. That never happened.

Now for some context I feel is necessary, early on in our marriage there were some trust and fidelity issues when I caught her pretty much on the brink of an emotional affair with her co worker. We stayed together and reconciled, it wasn't easy but I was glad we did and she was very remorseful about how far she had let things go. The problem is, the other guy had the same complexion that my son does. Now this realisation has got me very paranoid.",AmItheAsshole
"Funerals are a waste of time, money and resources.","**It appears the message of my post may have gotten lost in translation somewhere in the text. I would like to clarify.**  


*I am perfectly okay with funerals. Casket, open-casket/ viewing, decent burials, etc.   It's the excessive extravagance that we slap onto these ceremonies, just for the stuff to then go to waste. That I don't get.*   


Disclaimer: I have only been to one memorial/ funeral (I'm unsure if there's a distinction) and even so, we were only permitted to be there partially.  M grandfather's funeral was a fairly simple affair since he was cremated, and there wasn't much by way of memorial. Just a simple table at the church with a few photos of him. This unpopular opinion is about the non-cremated dead

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm in the minourity here, but.. I've come to be very confused about funerals. I just don't get it. Yes, respect the dead. Give them some respect (to a point). Don't be disrespectful, I agree.

But the whole process of a funeral? What even is the point of that? I understand if some people wish to pay respects to a body (even if it's just an empty shell now), but we waste so many resources on these... for lack of a better term, death ceremonies. We're spending tens of thousands of dollars on Caskets! Body preservations! SUITS, MAKEUP AND CLOTHES!

... Just to.. you know... shut the lid on the box and bury the damn thing completely, never to be seen or touched again. All of that preparation taken. All of that money spent. Just to.. throw a corpse in a box and smother it in earth. Large caskets, carefully carved, wood-stained and sanded/ smoothed... fancy pillow for the lifeless corpse to put its head on and making it seem 'bed-like'. The corpse actually having had people take the time to dress it, and cover it in makeup to hide the usual deathly pallor.We even have the body preserved!! But... literally -why-? We're going to see the dead body maybe... one last time and that's it.

To Reiterate and be clear: I agree that we should to a point, give a modicum of respect for the dead. Don't just toss a dead body naked in a ditch. But to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on a funeral, casket, and such? That just feels.. gaudy and incredibly wasteful. Particularly when one realizes that you just spent all that money, just to literally have it buried under several feet of dirt (or mud, depending on if its rainy).",unpopularopinion
[USA-OH] My 10 year old child is threatening suicide if returned to mother's for her visitation.,"I'm trying to get my child help but the mother won't allow it. I had an appointment today but she said she filed a report with the insurance company and local police to not allow it.

Soon to be ex wife is coming after me for spousal support and isn't qualified.,"Oregon

So as the title says my, soon to be ex wife, works 15-20hrs per week making minimum wage. Doesn't have any medical disabilities or anything like that stopping her from getting a job. The job she currently has is after care for a local school. 

I have told her in the past that she needs to get something that pays more or get another job sense she has set hours and she would yell back at me that she has a job, it's not her fault she gets Summers off or doesn't work more.

I work at a grocery store in the meat department and make 40k ish a year. Working 30-40hrs a week making 19.20hr.

She currently is living with her parents and has no plans on getting her own place. Her only bills are her auto insurance and gas. Her parents pay for everything else.

I got my own place after we split up and am paying for everything myself. I have given her $770 so far to help with remaining bills.

We were married for 5 years with no kids and she is trying to get me to pay her $500 a month for 2.5 years. I countered with $250 a month for 1 year and she rejected it.

I personally think that she should not get anything and that I shouldn't have to pay someone because they were too lazy to get a job themself. Am I wrong in thinking this?

Also I have set up a consultation to get an attorney myself.

Thank you for taking the time to read.


Edit: she is a college graduate with no student loans.


UPDATE: Her attorney just called and said her counter offer is $500 mo for 18 months. This is for her education degree she has, she didn't get some final certificates when she graduated so that is her reasoning for it. I didn't say I agreed or disagreed to it. I said I will think it over. I have meeting with an attorney for myself on Thursday. Thank you all for the advice and imput on things.",legaladvice
"Modern feminism, ""boss babe"" and ""girl power"" culture is really patronizing, degrading, and it is counterintuitive to the main message that equality is supposed to represent.","I am a mid-20s female, and this mentality just drives me insane. I get where people are coming from, but it just sounds so infantilizing to have an entire ""movement"" based around this idea that women need reassurance that they're capable, powerful, and smart too. 

For example, I am a small business owner, and I find it frustrating when other businesses go out of their way to say they're ""woman-owned"". It's like, okay...great...good for you, I guess? Should I applaud you or something? It's not a woman-owned business. It's just a fucking business, get over yourself.

The thing is, I'm not oblivious to the struggles women have had in the past, and still have to some degree today. But at some point, equality is equality and it's entirely counterintuitive to your cause if you're making up all these special treatments for women. 

I want help and support because I asked, because I need it, because I deserve it (if, in whatever situation, I do deserve it. Sometimes we don't.). I don't want this weird, automatic, yet backhanded support just because I'm a female. 

Another thing I hate is when other women are like, ""It's your obligation as a female to support other females!"" Uhh no. I will support you if I believe in you and what you're doing. But just because we both share a commonality, doesn't mean our values automatically align.

Don't get me wrong, I'm proud to be a woman! Or...at least as proud as normal people are about something they didn't earn or make happen themselves...like, it's fine and I'm happy with it. But, seriously. If you're a woman and you feel like you need that much reassurance in your life about your own autonomy and capabilities, then I'd say you should probably start doing some introspection into why that is, instead of constantly looking for it externally.",unpopularopinion

I know the original post didn't get a lot of attention and there probably isn't much demand for an update, but I did want to thank the people who commented and maybe give some guidance on expectations for anybody who might have the horrible luck to fall into a similar situation. Also it's just not something we want to talk about with friends/family…. So call it therapy for me.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

TLDR for the 1st post: Last Monday, soon after I left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Update: On Tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. My wife and I interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. After that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

An hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. Once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and I to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. The detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

From there we went home.

That afternoon, Neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. I opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. Soon after I went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. When I got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

For the most part, Wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. We did not see Neighbor all day. Wednesday night, we came to know why. A detective called to let us know Neighbor had been taken into custody on Tuesday night (while I was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (I assume arraignment).

Thursday morning a woman from the state DCF/CP&P office came to the house. She made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & I together. To my mind, this was actually a good thing.  She was able to let us know that Neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (I don't recall exactly what they are). She also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – Neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in California.

2 – Neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on Tuesday evening.

From there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. We will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

While she was there I asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if Neighbor was likely to be free again soon. She was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

Friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. She informed us that Neighbor's hearing was set for Monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. She wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have Neighbor remain in custody.

Here's the thing. Neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. I advised the detective that we were ok with Neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. She confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. We agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom Neighbor lives should have input.

That brings us up to date and, to be honest, I am torn. I HATE what this man did. I hate that it has happened before, and I never want it to happen again. With that said, at first I was unsure as to whether or not Neighbor even knew what he did. He clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. But he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. As he admitted the act to the arresting detective. I get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute Lennie from Of Mice & Men, and that tears my heart out. I don't think he really understands, and I don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. At the same time, he touched my son. If there were no clear impairment, I would want to take a baseball bat to his head. But there is, and instead I just feel like shit for everyone involved. This sucks, full stop.

On a more selfish note, the Megan's law registry. There are a handful of homes for sale in the area. Until now, my wife and I were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. That hope is now over. Because Neighbor's history all predates Mega's Law, he was not on the registry. Now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. I realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that Neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. To repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

Sorry for the book, and if the Mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, I understand. Honestly, I just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

Thanks to anyone who reads through.",legaladvice

We were also very close and touchy throughout the night, and when the party ended we exchanged numbers. On the Uber ride home my friend was explaining to me that I was basically getting close with the owner of the really nice house, he's telling me how's she's some high level investment banker and how she's worth millions of dollars.

AITA for making my boyfriend believe our cat ran away?,"We are both 24 and have lived together for 2 years in my apartment. For my birthday last year and he got me a cat for us to share which he named Lucy. I thought it was a cute name and I took care of her so well and love her very much. Last week we were having sex and he moans out Lucy's name. I ask him why he is moaning our cats name and he says it was just an accident. I ask some of his friends if he knows anyone names Lucy and discover that is a coworker of his that I didn't know he had. I talk to her and find out they have been cheating for the whole time we've had the cat. He literally got me a cat and named it after her so he would have an alibi if he accidentally said her name. I told her that he was my boyfriend and she didn't believe me so I showed her some pictures of us together and she started crying saying that she didn't know he was dating anyone. I told her that I was sorry and that it wasn't her fault but I'm glad we found this out. I kick my boyfriend out for cheating and he moves in with his brother. He tries to take the cat that he gave me. I don't feel that he should get the pet since he didn't buy it out of love but only as a cover for his cheating and I've been the one taking Lucy to all her vet checkups and buying all her food and toys and everything. I convinced him that the cat ran away and he's upset with me for that but I don't really care because I'm done with him and I don't feel he deserves to keep the cat that he gave me and never really took care of. AITA?

Edit: I'll try and answer the most common questions. 
- I don't think he planned to moan the cats name during sex, he has called me Lucy before in casual conversation and I didn't think anything of it because of the cat. 
- I did try to tell him the cat was a gift but he started spamming me with messages and since he knows where I live and work I didn't want him to start stalking me since he was showing signs of that. Once I told him the cat ran away he got mad and now doesn't want to talk to me anymore since it's my fault I lost the cat. So now I can just take care of my cat without worrying about him showing up unannounced 
- yes I am renaming the cat, one of the comments suggested Lucky and that will be her new name. :-)",AmItheAsshole
AITA for forcing a 6 year old kid to be separated from her parent on a flight?,"Title kinda sounds fucked up but hear me out lol

I recently was on an international flight and I always try to snag the window seat so I can sleep. A woman was seated next to me and asked if I could give up my seat since it turned out that her 6 year old was apparently seated in the row across. I tried to be nice about it and said, ""Sorry, but I specifically chose this seat and I don't really want to give it up, I've been traveling for hours.""

The woman's response was, ""Well so have we! Imagine traveling with an overtired kindergartener who now won't be able to sleep since she can't sit by her mom!"" She made me look like an asshole in front of the other people on the flight, and I felt bad since it was a little kid. I agree that it probably sucks to be traveling with a little kid, but AITA for not giving up my seat?

EDIT:

1. I was seated in the window seat, the woman was in the middle seat next to me, and another passenger was in the aisle seat next to her. 6 year old kid was across in the next row over in the aisle seat. Since the mother and the kid were only one seat away from each other, it wasn't so much an issue of not being seated next to each other, but more that the mom wanted her kid to have the window seat so she could sleep
2. This wasn't an issue of separation and the kid being scared. Her mom was ONE seat away. This was an issue of wanting the seat for her kid just so she could sleep
3. For those asking duration of the flight: 6 hours
4. For those asking ""Why didn't she ask the other person in the aisle seat?"" Because she specifically wanted the window seat for her child",AmItheAsshole

She believe it is natural for the man to pay for everything in the relationship (including house, food, car, expenses etc) while she spends her money on herself, and then contributes whatever she feels like, even when working and making twice what I make. For me the natural thing is to share expenses, and contribute more or less equally since we are a couple and live together. This is very hard for her to understand. From my point of view she seems entitled to special treatment.

There are more issues...  she told me that she told her ex that he had a small dick, she called her other ex worthless when he was depressed. So I basically worry she will treat me the same way if I won't be her little dog. That's the feeling I get.

What is going on here? I'm just trying to understand...or rather figure out if it is worth staying. Thanks people.

UPDATE:  Thanks for all the comments. First reddit post so this is very cool.This post was all about the bad, crucial stuff and the stuff she would start a silent and stubborn tantrum about.The good things in this relationship is that she seems very caring and attached to me, tries to understand all these differences in culture. She is very honest and we have a great time on a day-to-day basis, laughing, fooling around, sex and more.

I just can't get my head around her expectations. Is it just ""cultural differences"" that I can accommodate to some degree or is it her deep character...One of you said this about her thinking:   "" your money is 'our' money and her money is her money"" ( [FirstFarmOnTheLeft](https://www.reddit.com/user/FirstFarmOnTheLeft) ) ....which is spot on. That mindset bothers me a lot.

TIFU by stumbling across my mom's affair...,"(I started writing this when the whole situation first happened, but it started to get more and more complex, so I've been waiting to get as much info as possible, and it's been about two months since the first incident.)So here's some background information, my parents have been together 19 years. My dad's the real provider for the family, he was in the military for 26 years, but retired after being hurt in a car accident. He still makes good money off his new job and Veteran's Affairs checks. My mom spends a lot of his money on clothing and purses and other stuff, but it's kind of okay because she's a stay at home mom. The one thing I was always upset about her was that she traveled a lot, never taking any of my family with her. Me(16M), and my two little brothers(11) never have traveled anywhere with her. With that out of the way, here's the story. I was just playing Red Dead Redemption 2, and my mom came down to watch me play because that's her way of interacting with me. She kept asking questions about the story and stuff, and I'd tell her to listen to the characters and cutscenes but she wouldn't listen because she was just texting on her phone. Eventually, I was annoyed and said, ""Let's see what's keeping you busy."" I tried to grab the phone jokingly, but she got scared and pulled away, which got me interested. I left the room and five minutes later, I came back and took her phone right out of her hands while she wasn't looking, she started screaming and chasing me around. I tried to read but I couldn't read the texts, but I recognized the name(we'll call her V, who's a female). She was upset and left, and I figured something was up because if there was nothing to hide she wouldn't have acted this way. So I knew something was wrong. I acted distant the next few days because I was worried about what was wrong and that she was hiding stuff from me. A couple days past, and she sat me down before school, and asked me what I saw on her phone. Now since I didn't know any specifics, I didn't want her to know that so I just said, ""You tell me.""  That's when she basically said, ""You saw what I was talking to V about. How I like-like her.""  And guess what happened the next day. My dad told me he knew that I knew. WHICH MEANS HE KNOWS ABOUT THE AFFAIR!!!! He said  that he doesn't like it, but he has a couple reasons for tolerating it. 1.He still loves her, 2.He doesn't want to break the family up, and 3.She says she's ""exploring herself"" so he feels like it would be unfair to give her an ultimatum. I was pissed. My dad is sacrificing so much, including his self respect and happiness, and my moms sleeping around with her best friend. 

Now about two months have passed, and my dad is still unhappy, my mom still doing this, and she's barely at home anymore. She's at V's house 24/7 basically.(Another fun side note, V also has a husband and two kids, and her husband also knows and is also very sad and upset with this).

And the worst part is, my mom keeps making me and my dad hang out with V. She'll make us have dinner with her and her family, and it's so awkward and painful. I'm just really pissed off that my mom is just tearing apart my family and making us unhappy, just for her sake. 

For those of you that read this far, thank you for listening, and I hope you don't fuck up like I did.
Moral of the story is don't read other people's phones...

TLDR:I read my mom's phone, stumbled across her affair with her best friend, and my family's falling apart, yay!

EDIT:To the people(and I say people even though I only saw one guy say this) who are saying I'm an asshole for looking through my moms phone, yeah I fucked up, it's in the title, but I don't think it's all that fair to call me an asshole when looking at this entire situation.

EDIT: Also I'm stupid for not mentioning this earlier, but the affair has lasted longer than I've known about it, it started around last August, sorry I feel like that was something I should've mentioned",tifu

TIFU accidentally watching a Black Mirror Episode with Audio Description on,"Not today, but Black Mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and I just remembered my fuck up. 

Said episode was ""Shut up and Dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. Because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

Now, I don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. So the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""Sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

Had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and I definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. But of course, the Black Mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

I think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. We were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

Well, the end was near, and came the twist. Normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. We were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? And to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

We were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as Black Mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. After some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

Tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.

"[GA] Just moved into a condo, neighbor is tasing hell over my nonexistent pet bird","I just bought a condo that has been vacant for a while. Right after I bought the place, before I even started moving in, I got an official warning from the HOA that my next door neighbor has called their emergency line 3 times over my pet bird that is so loud in the mornings it startled him awake and caused him emotional distress. In their email they specifically said what time my bird was making these loud noises. 

Now, the thing is I don't have any pets, and for the past few nights I've stayed up to that specific time to see if I could here anything loud and disturbing as he described(which I did not, aside from a few birds chirping quietly outside). However, this neighbor is still calling the HOA's emergency line every night to complain about my bird. The HOA manager doesn't believe I don't have a pet bird, even though I've offered to let him come see. He said that I could just be hiding the bird.

Today I got a letter from Animal Welfare and Enforcement about my bird's vocalizations disturbing the peace. It said that I can be taken to court because of my bird if the neighbor complains again. I DON'T HAVE A BIRD OR ANY PET.

I've tried talking to the guy, but he refuses to answer his door, and when he comes out to watch me leave for work, he'll shut his door and ignore me if I try to talk to him.

I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I don't know what to say to her.,"Hey everyone. I don't know what to do in this situation because I never expected I'd face something like this. I'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but I'm coming up seriously short here.

I met my wife on Tinder at the end of 2015. We talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. By the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. We were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. More than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

I know, heavy topics for a first date. We were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

At the very least I held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. Her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. She immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

We dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. After getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

Four nights ago was the first time I ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. My wife was out with a friend, and I was doing some house cleaning. I was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so I took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. At the bottom I saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case B were visible. I immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

I had known that my wife was on her period because when I tried to initiate sex, she told me so. I found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and I made comment about the timing being odd. She told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. I figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

I haven't told her that I found the box. When she got home that night everything was so normal. I tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

The more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. What if she was assaulted? What if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? What if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? Or, what if she just cheated? I only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of Plan B and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

I don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. We have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. I've done nothing to displease her, at least that I know of. Maybe I'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than I'm giving it credit for. But I feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because I don't know how.

**tl;dr** I found a torn up Plan B box in my trash. The only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. How do I bring this up?",relationship_advice
AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

Someone stole my CEO's identity and asked me to buy gift cards for the office. I fell for a scam hard how do I fix this?,"Hello,

Essentially someone stole my current company CEO's identity and emailed me to ask to do a favor from him. We are a small office so this did not seem out of the ordinary. They asked me to buy google play gift cards for a bonus and send them the details. I was out sick and my CEO's off sight a lot so I had no way of knowing it was not him. He also said he was in a conference call and could not call at the moment. So I purchased the cards and sent the scammer the details of the cards.  It was not until the scammer asked for a second batch that I realized that it might not be him. I called the office verified that it was not him. I immediately went to the police and filed a report.  Following this I contacted google and they canceled all nonactivated cards. They said they could do nothing about the activated cards. My company also called the credit card company and marked the purchases as fraudulent as they were made on the company card that they issued to me.  In total, I am potentially out 4700$ dollars.

The worst thing is that I was sick with a fever and had been dealing with family issues so I was preoccupied and why it did not stand out more as a fraud. Anyway, what is the best way to go about recovering the money? Also, am I in danger of any legal jeopardy?

Donald Duck is an infinitely better character than Mickey Mouse,"I really don't know how Mickey has become so iconic because he's frankly quite boring. He has almost no flaws as a character, and he's the best at anything he tries, especially in the comic books.

Mickey's supporting characters are: gender swapped himself who loves him unconditionally, Goofy who's actually a much better character, and a bunch of bad Goofy clones like Horace the horse.

Donald has: the nephews who got better with each iteration (except for the sk8r 90s 2cool4skool phase) , Scrooge - his rich uncle with the deepest and most complex backstory in all of disneydom, Daisy who to be fair is also basically a gender swapped him/romantic interest, but what makes this relationship way more interesting is the fact that they are dysfunctional as fuck.

TIFU By finding my mom's butt plug.,"This just happened so I'm still living this nightmare. My parents are out of town for the night so my husband and I are staying at their place to watch the dogs. When we got here, we went to my old room and he started snooping around in my drawers. He found old notes that my friends and I used to pass in high school, old pictures, etc. I had my back turned to him when he started going through the bottom drawer in my old desk. When I turned around, he was holding a vibrator. 

Suddenly, it all came back to me. My mom has been sleeping in my room the past few years to get away from my dad's snoring, and that vibrator wasn't mine. ""DON'T TOUCH THAT! IT'S NOT MINE!"" He dropped it and we stared at each other for a few seconds. There were 2 vibrators and a silver butt plug on top of my old school supplies. He said, ""...I have to put it back how I found it."" Apparently he had been rummaging through the drawer and pulled it out of a black silk bag. So I made him use a towel to put it back and close the drawer. 

Now he won't stop popping his lips at me and singing, ""if your mom has a butt plug clap your hands!"" I think we'll have to sleep on the couch downstairs tonight instead of in my old bed. I'll have to face my mother in the morning when we hand the keys back over. 

TLDR: snooping husband found my mom's sex toys and wont stop taunting me about it.

I'm not angry or hurt or upset. Maybe a tad jealous but otherwise I'm honestly not bothered by it. 

It is understandable given our dead bedroom situation. We have only had sex a handful of times in the past year. He has always had a high sex drive and I'm just not in the mood for it most of the time.  The  birth of our second child caused significant tearing resulting in painful sex. I've also gained around 50 lbs from hypothyroidism and the pregnancies. My husband's a very good looking guy and works out at the gym most days a week. 

I'm probably more relieved than anything else. At least he is getting his sexual needs met. We've been married for ten years and have two kids under 5 and overall we have a good marriage other than the sex so I'm 99.99% confident that he isn't going to run off with her.

I and my wife have a 5yo daughter and we were trying to have another child when this happened and we felt that we could give her a better life. We were actually so happy. My daughter was very excited because she got an elder sister. She was very auiet and reserved but we thought that it was natural. 

But yesterday she came to me and she told me that she ate some chocolate from the fridge without asking us. I told her it was fine, and that this was her home and she could have whatever she wanted to.

But she suddenly started crying and told me that she deserved to be punished because she stole something. I was really taken aback by what I heard. My wife was alarmed and talked to her one on one and I was really shocked. 

My stepdad was an asshole and a predator. I don't want to get into explicit details but he used to hit her, and sexually harass her. I actually cried for so long because I couldn't imagine this innocent girl going through that. How do I help her?",relationship_advice

AITA for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?,"Throwaway because my sister knows my Reddit. 

I'm getting married next year and I'm so excited about it. My fiancé has all his groomsmen picked out, and I'm in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I'd also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I'm sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. 

I drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he'd be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said ""Will you be a part of my Bride Tribe?"", deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E's ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.

Fast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E's reaction didn't go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to ""fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold"" despite his transition. I tried to explain that I'd picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn't get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me ""basic"" and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.

I guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he'd be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he's still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it's best if he isn't a part of the bridal party. My fiancé says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I'm being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. She says I should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. She says I should give E a second chance and if I don't it will cause all kinds of family drama.

Would I be the asshole if I refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

ETA: 
Wow, I cannot believe how much this blew up. So I'm going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

E sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for ""snapping at me"". He admitted he was wrong and it was ""totally out of line"" and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party ""if I'd have him"". Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven't sent any response yet. 

A also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

ALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E.",AmItheAsshole
Crazy Neighbor Claimed to Own My House [Update] [KY],"So a few days ago I made a post on here asking for some advice relating to a woman trying to say she owns my property and attempting to evict us. We have everything figured out now so I figured I'd post a small update.

We spoke to city and county officials and have gotten proof of ownership of our property (including the fact that we paid our fucking property tax today) and are beginning to take steps to get a restraining order on the Crazy Lady.

"[Update] ""My work's fun committee ignored reasonable request, HR told me to pound sand.""","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8826mu/ny_my_works_fun_committee_ignored_reasonable/

(New York)

A lot has happened over the last ten days.

I realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  I cannot live like this anymore.  And I mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

I was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that I was completely prepared to just stop living because I was too scared to find help.  So I went and found help.  

I took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, I found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  I've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

When I finally went back to work, I took the head of the Fun Committee aside and talked to her.  I explained to her that I have PTSD and some very severe anxiety issues and I apologized for not being more clear to her when I asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

And she cried.  She wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought I was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

Then, I spoke to my Manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where I can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  It is literally all I have ever wanted.

So, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  Apparently.

Thank you.",legaladvice

"Trying my luck on this sub. ""My [37M] Son [21M] Slept With My Girlfriend [32], I Don't Know How To Process This Level Of Betrayal""","**Deleted off the other relationship sub, advised to repost here**

I apologize in advance if this isn't the most coherent thing in the world, this is partially just me venting to the void. About 4 years ago I lost my wife, the mother of my son, to lung cancer. We had been together since we were 14. It was the darkest time in my life, I had considered suicide on a nearly daily basis. I pushed on for my son, and because my wife made me promise to make the most of life.

We had our son pretty young, I worked two jobs to keep us afloat and thankfully was able to provide a decent upbringing until he moved out at 16, although I still paid (and continued to do so until this happened) a portion of his bills. The loss was extremely hard on my son as well, he came back to stay with me for awhile and we'd work through the grief together every day. I got him into therapy, pushed him to get involved in things to keep his mind busy and when he moved back into his apartment I'd call every night to check on him and visited multiple times a week. We were always extremely close.

My wife told me outright after her diagnosis that she didn't want me alone, so I made myself available. My girlfriend and I met about two years ago and hit it off. She isn't my wife, but I loved her for who she was and we really connected. I was reluctant to introduce her to my son because I was afraid he'd feel I was betraying his mother so I held off for the first year, which I regretted as they ended up getting along very well. We'd hang out together, my son was happy, I was happy. She moved in with me about 5 months ago.

This past Thursday he was over for dinner and movies. We've had this little game since he was a teenager where I'd pop up over his shoulder when he was on his phone in common areas and say ""stop looking at that!"" in an accusing way to mess with him even though he was never looking at anything. Turns out this time he was doing something and I seen topless photos on his phone. I recognized the photos to be of my girlfriend, same tattoo placement between the breasts. I grabbed the phone from him and he immediately starts pleading his case. I go into gallery and there are easily two dozen photos of my girlfriend, some of him I'm assuming he sent to her, one or two of them together. By this time he's crying and trying to grab the phone back, I check his texts and he has two weeks worth of conversations with her (under a different name) detailing the fact they've been fucking around behind my back. My girlfriend is in the room begging to know what's going on.

I'm not proud of the fact I lost myself. I screamed at them both, I smashed the phone (yes, I know this is unacceptable, yes I'm in therapy, yes it's the first time I got aggressive with either of them), I demanded details. My son kept apologizing and saying he didn't know why and that it had only started two weeks ago, they slept together 3 times. My girlfriend was sobbing and kept trying to hug me, telling me it was ""a mistake"", purely physical and that she'd never speak to him again. I screamed at my son that I'd given my life to him, that he knew what this meant to me, that he was all I had left. I pulled him upstairs and gave him the money for his phone and kicked him out. I went upstairs to our bedroom, turned her drawers upside down and packed her clothes into two travel bags while she kept asking me to listen. I put them outside, guided her through the door and told her she could have someone else get the rest of her belongings this week.

Both of them have been texting me nonstop until last night, at which point I blocked their number. I feel completely detached. The fact that after 2 years my girlfriend, knowing my history, could betray me is painful enough, and absolutely nothing will make me forgive her. She refuses to get her stuff until I talk to her so I'm having a friend drop it off to her. The fact my son, who I dropped everything for, worked non-stop to provide for, who was all I had left in this world could do this to me knowing what it would do is another pain entirely. It feels like I lost another family member. I ache for my wife all over again. I know everyone processes grief differently but this was two years after her passing, he had a girlfriend and I was there for him (as were therapists) every step of the way, so I have a hard time believing grief is the cause of his decision. I can't see this as a mistake, he didn't trip and fall. It was a conscious choice to betray someone who loved him.

I want to honor my wife by giving my son a chance, to hold on to the little family I have left. But this isn't like he stole money from me, it isn't even something that happened once while drunk. He was there for that grief with me, he knew how hard it was for me to move on. Of all the women, he chose mine. All the apologies or future effort can'r erase that fact or the memory of it. I never did wrong by him, and now I feel like the kid I raised isn't there anymore. Thanks to friends I'm not drifting into thoughts of self harm again, but I don't know if I have it in me to ever forgive him. If and when that day comes, what steps can I take to process what happened, talk to him without feeling disgust and open the door to trusting him again? And if that day never comes, does that make me a bad person?

**Edit** Some brief clarification since people on the other relationship sub took this and ran with it. 1.) Nothing caused him to move out, he asked and said it'd be cool and I helped pay his bills. No hidden resentment I've ever been aware of. 2.) Yes, popping up over his shoulder sometimes was something we both found funny. No I wasn't actually trying to invade his privacy, yes he was a part of the joke. 3.) Yes I know I was aggressive. I paid for the phone and will be discussing it in therapy. 4.) Yes I know this sounds like something out of a movie, it's not.

**TL;DR**: Lost my wife four years ago, just me and my son ever since. Found out he's sleeping with my girlfriend, feel completely empty inside. Need some sort of comfort or advice on how or if this can ever be fixed between him and I, and if that doesn't happen will I ever feel whole on my own again.",relationship_advice

AITA for moving forward with the pregnancy against the wishes of the bio father and his wife?,"I'm going to be real brief. I thought I was in a monogamous long-distance relationship with a man (management consultant) who travels to my city a lot for work. I found out he's actually married with several young children. He lied to me about his age (much older), his real name, and his relationship status. 

But I'm pregnant with his child. I am hiring an attorney to guide me through the child support process.

He is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn't terminate.

LPT: keep an extra set of clothes and essentials in your car.,"Keep a small tote with a few essentials in it in the trunk of my car for emergencies.

I keep:

An extra set of clothes (socks, shorts, cheap flipflops, sweatpants, shirt, sweatshirt, underwear, and a hat)

Insulated leather gloves

Flashlight (batteries not inside to prevent draining/corrosion)

Deoderant

Towel

Hand sanitizer

A deck of cards

Lighter

Small cheap pocket knife

Paracord

I can't even tell you how many times this has been a total lifesaver for me or others. Went hiking and your socks are soaked? put on some dry ones. Go on a road trip and forgot deoderant? Boom, no problem. Went fishing and someone fell in the water? They have dry clothes and you are their hero. 

The tote will be shockingly useful in a lot of surprising ways, too. One time someone hit my car, knocking my bumper half off. Luckily I had rope to tie it up and get it home. Another time I was drinking at a friends' and we all decided to go swimming. I got the gym shorts out of my car and didn't have to go swimming in my jeans/naked. I also had a towel to dry off with.

My tote is pretty small (14x10x10 or so) but has had a solution of most of the problems i've ran into. Everything is pretty cheap and well worth the time to put it together. Does anyone else do anything similar or keep other things in their trunk? (A small first aid kit is also great to have, but I keep that separately)

AITA For saying no when a child I didn't know asked if she could play with my sons bike.,"This is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and I'm fed up of being called an asshole so I'm going to ask on here. 

We are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. 

My son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. He had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

When we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blasé attitude towards belongings and she's lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn't attached to material things.

I interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl 'why don't you ask (my son) since it's his bike?' She did and my son said no. She looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn't seem bothered afterwards. 

My entire family looked at my like I was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. 

I got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and I was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son 'honey, sometimes it's nice to share' because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it's his new toy and he shouldn't be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

She agreed I could have some so I did. She's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so I ate the rest of an almost full packet.

She has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back. 

She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances.

Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland.

My (24M) gf (24F) is unusually buying new bras and panties,"Over the last two and half weeks my gf has bought close to 9 new pairs of lingerie. This is unusual because she bought some 7 new pairs somewhere at the beginning of April. Now I don't mind a girl buying new lingerie, but this is unusual - she had close to 40 new pairs of lingerie, a count which keeps on decreasing every other day. Now I take out trash every given day, and I've observed that she hasn't thrown her old lingerie in trash over past one week, while there's no trace of it anywhere in our apartment. And yet she is missing 4-5 pairs from our common closet. She seems to act pretty normal, there's no dent in her daily routine. But it boggles me why she is on this lingerie shopping spree? It's not like she is amassing a stockpile of lingerie, her lingerie count is somewhat unchanged from the time before this madness. I couldn't find trace of her old lingerie. Am I being paranoid? Am I missing something here feminine that's otherwise normal? Should I ask her anything about it?

TL;DR GF buying new lingerie every few days, while leaving no trace where she threw her old ones.

**UPDATE**: I might ask her while we drive down to the train station in next 30 minutes. Will keep you guys posted.

**UPDATE 2**: Alright I chatted with her while driving. I started off by asking her directly as u/fightmaxmaster suggested. She said something like she hasn't been feeling good about her underwear fitting (old and new) while at work. So she has taken a new vow - if she finds any underwear incredibly uncomfortable, she will throw it off immediately. I asked her I haven't noticed any in our trash (maintaining my casual tone) and she said since since we spend most our daytime at work she disposes it off in her workplace bin and carries pair of change underwear, like most women do. I even said to her jokingly ""Oh, I was worried you were seelling your undies on eBay or something"" (just to get some kind of an answer) and she ewwed my remark. **Do women do that at work or get rid off their old undies when they find it uncomfortable like this?** I could really use your insight on this. Tbh, we moved together at the beginning of this year and this is the first time I've moved in with a girl, in a relationship. I don't know what else I could do, since she has made it clear she drops it off in work trash and has shown no intention/fetish to sell it online. But overall, I tried to make this conversation as 'just out of curiosity' as I could.

**UPDATE 3**: This is way too overwhelming. I am heading back home and taking a day off. I know I might be overreacting but somehow it just doesn't sound right, the conversation we had an hour ago. Might talk to her again during her lunch break.

**UPDATE 4**: Seriously guys, thank you!! I have been glued to my phone all morning along, except driving back home. It took me a lot of self-convincing to gather clues for a possibility that my gf might be selling it online. Back at home, we have place to archive open mails, receipts, bills and other important documents except for our social and other personal items. There were 6 receipts in total, 2 from Victoria's Secret and 3 from Target and 1 from Macy's. Against my rough counting, she had amassed some 28-30 pairs of new lingerie, including the one at the beginning of April. Two of these receipts had Karen's name on it (my gf's elder sister), I believe Karen has some kind of rewards card from VS. That itself accounts for 40% of her new purchases. Till now I thought she had probably purchased 15 pairs, give or take. I don't wanna invade her privacy by sneaking her bank statements, because that would be a bit over the line. I cannot believe that she spent $1100+ on lingerie over past 45 days. That by itself is so fucking unusual. It's also odd that she hasn't paid using our RED card at Target (we have Target app on our phones). I am calling my brother over to get some clarity. I don't know if it would be right to login to her laptop and see her browsing history to confirm if she's selling her underwear online. I am just numbed atm.

**UPDATE 5**: I spoke to my brother and saw some of your comments. I've decided to confront her in-person when she's back home. I don't wanna take any chances or let any form of miscommunication trigger chain reactions for questions that might be unwarranted to her.

**UPDATE 6**: You know you have one of those days when all the hell breaks loose and this was one for me. I skipped lunch break phone call in hopes I can talk to my gf when she gets back home. Spoke to Karen and her mom in the meantime to ensure if she isn't in some kind of financial mess or other kind of trouble. But it takes one fucking truth to destroy it all. You guys, my gf saw this post at work and she immediately knew it was me posting it here. I didn't realize this, leaving rest of her day off. Some 4 hours ago my gf confessed that she was sleeping with some guy she met at her work gym. Since the beginning of March. Fuck me. 

She met this guy at her work gym some 8 months ago. This guy is not even from her workplace, he works at this other startup, in a different building of this corporate park. She said things got all heated up late February after one afternoon. I fucking though she stopped going to gym owing to her hectic schedule after her promotion late November. But there she was, going to gym all along. From the day she started sleeping with this guy, she told her coworkers she has switched gyms across the street. I haven't even cared to ask where they did it. The missing underwear: this is so messed up. Sick. She had this realization midway in March that this was wrong. I don't know why I never saw this side of her but she began buying new underwear and throwing it off **AS SOME FUCKING GUILT RITUAL**. She said she couldn't get off that guilt of wearing the same underwear in bed with me as she worn hours earlier sleeping with that mf. Do you know how disgusting that feels? Who fucking does this - throw underwear because you want tp dust off guilt from having it worn during sex with a guy you've met and barely known? I was stand still, but I held up for the moment. She says she was confused and that she has backed away from this guy's advances since past one week. I don't believe any word of it. In fact I don't think I wanna believe what she's said. Also, the ""tossing her underwear at workplace"" was an excuse - yes, because back then I was driving and she didn't know how to react or what to say, so she made that excuse up. And here I was worrying whole day what it could be.

I later called Karen because we were both emotionally drained. I didn't even wait a bit after she arrived. Even Karen was shocked by the ramble. She later called me, because I had already left them in our apartment. It took me a while to get my thinking right and call my brother. I'll be crashing at his house for now. 

Honestly I don't even wanna see her face ever. How can someone lie so perfectly? How can someone be so cold that they show no emotional change or discomfort when sleeping with two people??? WTF - she slept with me hours after she slept with that idiot? And throwing underwear was her means to get over that guilt. I don't understand her anymore. When she said it was all carnal, I didn't even know she believed in notion of sleeping around with people for physical needs. She said she still loves me and this was just something that made her feel good. I don't even know what to interpret of that. Honestly I think my thoughts are all over the place. But thank you - I don't know if I could have known about this if it wasn't for this post. It was after dinner did I realize that was trending on this sub, and this post made her take the mid-day train back home. I have so many questions. Part of me wants to see her again just to make sure she is alright. Part of me doesn't want to see her ever again. I have so many questions but I just avoided her by walking downstairs in no time. I had to ask my brother and his wife to pick some stuff off from home. Shit this is all messed up.

AITA for walking out of Thanksgiving dinner after my family went out of the way for me. It was a DISASTER.,"There are a lot of moving parts to this story, but here's a brief backstory. 

Every year since I was a child thanksgiving has been held at grandmas. In 2012 my step uncle took advantage of me being blacked out drunk, came into the room I was passed out in, and molested me. Took years to get over it. My whole family still talks to him. As if it never happened. Pretty sure no one believes me. This man lives in another state. 

So fast forward to this year and a week before thanksgiving grandma calls to give me a heads up that this man will be in town this year. So obviously, myself and my husband and two kids won't be going. I am the one who has to rearrange my plans, my family has to miss out. Not him. Which I think is just mind blowing... but moving forward. 

My mom is torn. She feels bad for grandma but also wants to see me and her grandkids. So she decided to hold thanksgiving at her boyfriends house for her immediate family. She tells me to be there at 5, but that I can come over whenever. I'm tasked with desserts so I spend my day baking pies and wrangling my twins to get everyone ready. 

We arrive at 5:30ish. Late as usual. It's a kid thing. Things are going great. Food is delicious. We decided to play cards against humanity and I leave to run home and grab it really quick. While I'm gone husband calls to say my mom, sister, brother, and the boyfriend and left to grandmas but will be back soon. TWO god damn hours pass and they still aren't back. They've been gone longer then they were there meanwhile we are in this house with two other people we don't really know. The roommate of the boyfriend and another girl. I'm furious. 

So I decided we are leaving. I pack everyone up and text my mom as we get in the car and she says they are almost there. She also sends another text that was a little garbeled but said that I'm not leaving because we are going to get.. and I quote, ""tore up from the floor up."" Let that sink in for a minuet. My MOM, who has never said that in her life, is speaking to me like a 17 year old thot. What in the actual fuck? So they show up and she is wasted. We are all outside and I say three times we are leaving just because I want to go. She pushes for an answer and I blow up. I tell her it's complete bullshit she left in the middle of OUR thanksgiving to go to grandmas. Like why didn't she go earlier in the day?? It's bullshit that she assumes I'd want to get drunk on this day. I don't drink on thanksgiving. I haven't since 2012 because I CANT. I'm always the DD and I prefer it that way. Too much anxiety. 

My bitch ass sister decided to pipe up and says ""but we moved thanksgiving for you!"" And that's where shit hit the fan. I didn't ASK for that. I asked to see them in a different day. They didn't move thanksgiving FOR me, they moved it BECAUSE of me. Because it's awkward for everyone apparently. I hear my sister loudly apologize to her boyfriend for having to witness such a monstrosity as her black sheep sister, and I get in the car. We drive away and I haven't heard from my family since. I ruined everyone's thanksgiving. I feel extremely angry at my family, but I also feel guilt. I have no idea why. AITA? 

Edit 1: spelling. Sorry, on mobile and type all angry and fast to get it out. 

Edit 2: Holy Support! First off, to all of those who suspect karma farming, I promise you that is not the case. I don't have much karma. This is my very first post that has done this, and I didn't intend for it to. Secondly, trauma guilt is a thing. I wish I would have posted the issue with my uncle and family years ago. It would have saved me a lot of questioning my own sanity. I feel validated, yes! But I came here to check my self to make sure I wasn't actually the asshole. Because it wasn't clear until now that I truly Am NTA! Thank you to everyone for the love and supporting comments! I needed to hear this so badly! 

Edit 3: Answer to the ""how did you know if you were blacked out."" I posted this is in the comments but I guess after awhile people don't read all the way down. 

Quite the personal story,  but I'm in a place I can talk about it so okay.

The next morning I had frames of memory that I original felt like were a dream. The whole thing is foggy. He approached me the next morning and asked me if I remembered. I said something like ""uh no"" and he told me that I had sucked his dick. I told him there was no way. Literally used the line ""even if you were Channing Tatum"" there was no way. I remember that clear as day. That afternoon he left and sent me a text telling me that I better not tell anyone. That if I did we would both loose or marriages. I spent a good 4 months pretty fucked up. Going over those frames of memory, trying to make sense of it. I felt dirty. I felt like maybe I had been wrong. Maybe I didn't remember right.

Through counseling those frames became a little bit clearer. I was walked through accepting what happened that night, being reminded of key details that proved to my brain that I was not at fault. Details like my husband walked me into the bedroom to put me to bed because I was drunk. He took of my shoes, tucked me in, and closed the door. I remember that. At some point this uncle open the door. Came in, uninvited. THAT is the key I hold to reminding myself I am not at fault and I should not feel dirty or guilty. Lots of therapy.

"LPT: If you have a college ID, ask every place you buy something if they have a student discount.

Edit:

This post has gotten a lot of attention, just a few more important notes:

• there are apps (like UNiDAYS) that tell you what places offer student discounts 
• it also doesn't hurt to ask whenever you initially enter a store ""what discounts do you have""
• always check the current signage in the store. My store is plastered all over with signs about what sales we have going on at the time but I'll mention our sales to someone and they'll be surprised (as they didn't read the signage)",LifeProTips

TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.,"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Caught gf sending lewd photos - BUT how do I go about acting on this...,"Quick back story, I was told by her in Feb that a guy at her work fancied her, she said she wasn't interested. Turns out she met him out of work once (as 'friends'), I hit the roof, she said sorry, blah blah, the usual. He left her work and got another job a few weeks later (unrelated). A few months later she asked how i felt if she met him to 'catch up' as he had left her work, i was not happy at all and made it known, she said she told me about it to be clear and honest, no funny business, etc. I said again, I'm not happy but do whatever because otherwise I'm 'controlling' but I trust her to make the right decision. She still met him.

At this point i'm ready to call time on this shit BUT - We have a mortgage. I need to get financial advice regarding this. We're not married.

Fast forward last night.

&#x200B;

I caught her sitting on our sofa sending lewd selfies (lifting her top etc), however there's a twist. So obviously I've suspected this shit for months, I popped upstairs and left my phone upright on a desk near the sofa recording... And boom, played back the video a little later and saw it. 

&#x200B;

So where do I stand in this. It feels awkward because I secretly filmed this (which I know is fucking weird but i suspected something, needed to know, and well.. It turns out I was correct). 

&#x200B;

What should I do? I can bet without doubt it will be turned on me 'having trust issues' or something and what I did will make me the fucking bad party in this. Make no mistake, I'm fuming, I blame her in this, not the guy. It takes two to tango.",relationship_advice

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

LPT: Tell your parents/grandparents to call your phone number immediately if they ever get a call saying that you need money.,"Scammers will call older people and try to make it sound like their son/daughter is in trouble and they need some amount of money wired to a weird address. By having them call your phone number if they ever get a call like this, it will prevent them from losing money or having their identity stolen.

"Out of town for business, my rental car was flagged as stolen weeks before I rented it resulting in a felony traffic stop involving 8 officers.","I'm in San Francisco for work, and my wife flew out this weekend so we could visit Napa. On the way there, we noticed an officer following us, and as soon as we got off our exit we were pulled over. Three other squad cars blocked the off ramp and pulled their guns on us. They asked me to put our hands in the air, throw the keys out of the window, walk backwards, get on my knees, etc. they did the same with my wife and when we asked why this was happening they didn't answer. 

They put me in the back of the squad car, and read my rights to me. They then told me the car was stolen, to which I responded it was a rental. After some time they confirmed the paper work with the rental company, and cleared the plates. They explained that the company reported it stolen weeks ago when it wasn't returned on time, then never followed up with the police department. The officers explained that the city we were in has one of the highest crime rates in America which was why they had to take it as seriously as they did. We later confirmed that with locals as well as the good old internet.

A few weeks ago both of them were staying with me and while she was at work he gave me a really hard time.

When my gf got home I told her about it and she said that he had a point and to leave punishment up to her.   

Since then I've had the opinion that if I can't have a say in how he acts then he is 100% her responsibility.  I've told her that if she and him comes to my place and she leaves she needs to hire a sitter.   I've also stopped paying for meals when we all go out to eat.

AITA for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip,"Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

Me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn't want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
We also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn't want to go through that again in this one.

The fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.

Anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

First I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be ""discovering herself"" on this trip, and when I asked why hadn't she told me she said because I wouldn't have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)

Well an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: 

Gf: ""why can't I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest""

Me: ""you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out""

I believe it was the right thing to do as she didn't pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn't have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

That night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?

TLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house.

TIFU watching incest porn,"*Throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

This happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That's all this was. Research. 

So, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

Cut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&A: 

*""You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

My old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

I frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

Dad: Suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids. 

Me: 

I immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home.

""Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.""

Yes, she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

TIFU by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store...,"This happened earlier today and I'm pretty sure I'm on a police watch list now.

Needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store I was running low on that I like to have around. Zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

While I was there I noticed they were having a store wide sale. I'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up I like to keep certain back up items in my truck if I need them. I figured I would grab some things while they are on sale.

Walking through the isles I start randomly grabbing items I think I might need for my kit. Such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

Keep in mind I already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when I walk up to the register. These are things I generally purchase, buy never all at once.

Girl at the register greets me as I start placing items on the counter. I give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

About half way through she slows down a bit. She looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. I'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

Then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

Her: ""Wow that's a big knife.""
Me: ""Yeah I like having cheap, throwaway knives around. Same with tarps and stuff too.""
Stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

Her: ""Can I see your ID to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
Me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as I've never been asked for my ID here. Pull it out and hand it to her. 

She quickly looks at my ID info and then glances up at her screen where I noticed my reward info was pulled up. Didn't think anything of it at the time.

She says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. Almost looking like she was taking inventory of what I had.

She gives me my total and I hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

I get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. She yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. I grab it as I notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
I say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

I get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. She glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

I was like what? Still clueless. Before she points out that it looks like I'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

Girl at register must have thought the same thing. Checked my info and I'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

Told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

TL;DR:

I have a twin (we're 16,M). We have identical faces, but you can't mix us up. I have long blonde hair, he has short black hair and piercings. He's bigger, like he works out. No one mixes us up. 

We have known her for 2 years. She mixes our names up all the time. At least 3 times a day. We know she's doing it on purpose to annoy us. 

So. Yesterday I was in living room and she called me my twin's name. I just ignored her and pretended she wasn't there. Then she called me my name and I answered her normally. My brother did the same, we did it few times. Now she's mad at us, apparently we're being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes ""honest mistake"" sometimes.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by looking up my school bully,"So a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when I was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. I struggled like hell because I didn't speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. So that's he kind of person I'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can't be that unfair. 

Fast forward 15 years. I haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn't make any friends and I didn't develop Stockholm's. I looked him up on Facebook. 

He owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can't get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed.

Not too exciting but an update none the less.

Not long after the original post I ended up sending an email to my landlord with a copy of the letter from the HOA and explained my situation. The next day I received a phone call from my landlord and she said not to worry about it. According to her despite my lease stating that the ""Tenant agrees to abide by any applicable owners association regulations as they now exist or may be amended."" this was a rather unreasonable demand by the HOA and isn't something that should be held against me or any other tenants she has in the neighborhood. She said she would take care of the situation with the HOA and offered to pay any fines that resulted in the meantime.

As of today I have received another letter from the HOA that said until further notice they will not be enforcing the rule regarding parking of vehicles older than 10 years old.

I haven't received any violations from the HOA up to this point and have yet to hear anything else from my landlord.

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

Since that time I got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until I landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. She calls at least once per day. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

How incredibly bad is that plan? Before anyone says it. I know... I know ok I should have quit a long time ago. I did not.

"UPDATE to ""He's(25) falling out of love and I(25f) don't know what to do"": Why he avoided me.","[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b17a0h/hes25_falling_out_of_love_and_i25f_dont_know_what/)

What happened after I made the post: I wrote him a letter, hinting that this relationship won't work if it continues like this. I also printed the post I had made and the comments I got. I thought maybe it helps if he sees it from a different perspective. I put the letter and what I printed on the bed, together with a photo book of an amazing vacation we had. I then removed the SIM card from my phone, a), because I didn't want to communicate with him until he read what I had left on the bed, and b), because the phone was actually his old one as my actual phone had been sent in to be repaired, and had now arrived at my parents', and that's were I wanted to spend the weekend. Then I picked up all our pets, and left for my home town (I always take them with me when I visit my parents).

Apparently, he came home early from work, only about an hour after I had left, to a deserted apartment. When I put the SIM card back into the repaired phone about 7 hours later, he had left a few messages, saying that he had read what I had written and printed out, thought a lot about all this, he had looked through the photo book, and had a conversation with a friend. That friend is almost twice as old as we are, used to be his drinking buddy and is sort of a father figure for my boyfriend. He said that this friend had gone through the same situation with his wife. Apparently, he had been so stressed out by his job going downhill, he tried to safe it by working longer hours, which sometimes created some tension between his wife and him, so he avoided her by going out for drinks every night, creating a vicious cycle of her being unhappy about not seeing him and him avoiding her even more.

But he had found a solution. He realised that his job shouldn't define his life. He made a list of goals he wants to tick off each week. His marriage has apparently been going very well since then (it's the reason why I said he used to be my boyfriend's drinking buddy!).

My boyfriend said it dawned on him. He's in the same situation. He's putting in as much effort as the CEO who doesn't even appreciate his work. He doesn't want to lose me, I'm the best thing that has ever come to his life. He apparently cried a lot and made his own list of goals he wants to tick off each week. When I came back Sunday night, I found it on our fridge. It has very specific goals about him working less overtime and making up for the lost time by taking time off, spontanously going out only once a week max with his drinking buddies, and spending time with me doing real activities at least twice a week.

Since then, our dynamic has changed entirely. We had sex. We cuddled. We talked. He was there. Now it's only been 6 days since I made the post, but I hope it stays this great between us. I guess the realisations he had could help with him keeping up his new goal habits.

Weirdly, all the talks we had before when I told him I was unhappy because we didn't see each other much probably contributed to him avoiding me even more after already being stressed from work. This ""talk"" was different, because it made him realise that he'd lose me if it continued like this, and because it made him reach out to his friend. Maybe the deserted apartment contributed as well, because it was a little taste into life without me.

TL;DR: I probably owe my boyfriend's friend big time.",relationship_advice

[Update] I think my mom is going to try to kill my grandmother and make it look like suicide.,"I wanted to thank the r/legaladvice community and give an update to [my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9sudc9/i_think_my_mom_is_going_to_try_to_kill_my/) from about 4 months ago. For privacy purposes as this is an ongoing situation, this post will be fairly short and vague.

Last month my grandmother was admitted to the ICU in respiratory failure. She pulled through, but with the help of my aunts, uncles and cousins we determined (with evidence) that my mom has been both neglecting my grandmother's medical needs and drugging my grandmother without her knowledge. Although she wouldn't outright say it to me, it turns out that my mother had been insisting to my cousins that my grandmother was suicidal, and even tried to keep pushing the 'she wants to kill herself' narrative while my grandmother was hospitalized. We believe that she may have even attempted to OD my grandmother at the hospital, but her plan was thwarted by ever-present relatives. As an aside, we did alert the hospital of the situation and unfortunately were told they couldn't do anything because ""it's a family matter"". Everything is now in the hands of my aunt, who's working with a lawyer to address the situation in the least stressful way for my grandmother. Thank you all for your advice and support on my last post, and I'm so glad that my grandmother is still with us. I truly believed that this situation would only end in tragedy, but it seems fate had different plans. My grandmother is still in the care of my mother for the moment (with relatives checking in daily), and while my mother is not yet aware that my family knows of *everything* she's been doing, she does at least know that her siblings are seeking to change the POA and insurance benefits out of her name, and has since completely changed her tune about my grandmother's mental health. Otherwise, my grandmother is home and doing well, and is under the close eye of her children, doctors and social worker while my family works out where to go from here. Thank you all again.

WIBTA for not wanting to feed my ex-wife?,"My ex and I have two boys (7 and 11) and we have 50-50 custody. Every Thursday she comes to my house to pick them up for her time. I noticed more and more food was gone, but not for sure. I was able to confirm that food was going missing because someone drank my last can of Ginger Ale. I asked my sons' sitter if he knew anything about it and he said my ex drank it. I was confused. Apparently, when my ex comes to pick up them up, she'll start making a snack for herself like she lives there. I thought about it and want it to stop.

The issue is that she is unemployed and has no money. I believe she is hungry. It's not about the money or cleaning up after yourself - it's about boundaries.

I believe that my ex is barely breaking even at the end of each month and lives paycheck-to-paycheck. She lost her job back in August and just found something in October so that fucked her finances up. 

That's not my problem though.  

My problem is that she just welcomes herself to my food. Literally, the stuff she eats is the food that I buy for myself. For example, my diet ginger ale.

TIFU I said no to my Gf's proposal.,"WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ONE. SCROLL DOWN TO THE TL;DR IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FULL STORY. 

Yeah... I f***ed up today. See, I've been dating my GF (K) for 5 years. We are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. I've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. The reason I haven't is that about 2 years ago, I got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

It's been VERY rough on the two of us, but K has stuck with  me every step of the way. My disease, GPA, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. I'm starting drugs that haven't been FDA approved for my condition. All other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. This new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. I'm terrified to say the least. All of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

I want to be healthy and stable before I even think about marriage. I don't want to leave K as a widow with no support! K & I had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that I needed to go into remission first. We agreed to it, or so I thought. Flash foreword to a few hours ago and K is with MY FAMILY in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

I saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. I immediately started freaking out. First thought: I haven't even gone into remission yet and I have no clue if I'm going to get better. I cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. What if I die from all of this? Second thought: GODDAMN IT DAD! Why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

I guess I'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my Dad was a very involved parent when I was young. When I entered High-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. The expectations would get so high that I couldn't live up to them. Similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. Both my brothers and I find this to be a real problem, if my Dad is left unchecked. I would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. Back to the story!

Anyway, I'm freaking out. I just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. Sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" With my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, I ran out of the building... I made the love of my life cry as I selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. I've never felt so ashamed in my life... After calming down, I talked to my Mother, and drove back to talk to K.

In the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. Tears were shed and things were said. K told me I was being selfish. ""We've been dating for years, who cares if you die, I want to marry you!"" She also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. She understood why I would be paranoid about my dad though. K understands that my Dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

In the end, we reconciled. We made up, decided that I was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. We came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

Now I'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if I do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, I'll be with my best friend/lover. K is my world, and I'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

Thanks for listening.

Wife is a teacher and needs to be up at 5AM, I don't need to be up till 8AM. She goes to bed every night at 10PM and I grew up a night owl, I enjoy staying up late past that for alone time and to dork around on my PC.

I always go to bed with her because I love her and genuinely enjoy laying next to her and kissing her goodnight, but she has become increasingly aggressive and frustrated by me leaving around 10:30 to go into the other room. She doesn't want to be alone, but typically we spend every moment together from the moment I walk in the door after work.

TIFU by uploading my old exams on the internet.,"So this all happened in June, and I'm only writing about it now because the situation just got solved.

As the broke college student I am I found a website that offered me money for my notes about classes and old exams that I have taken, extremely simply procedure that consists of simply uploading PDFs on the web, categorizing them, and then getting a payment on my paypal. I think ""Great! I make money and I can help kids seeing what to expect on the exam by seeing the old ones"". 

The fact that I scanned all my exams and kept them in my Google Drive to have them as possible study material made the whole process easier. I upload 5 documents from my Organic Chemistry class and get paid $25, I figure that I might as well do it for all the classes, more money to buy alcohol you know?

In the span of a couple days I upload about 120 documents for subjects such as OChem, Physics, Calculus that span from old exams to notes to summaries about the whole class, pretty much my old study materials. I get a couple hundred bucks and go buy my, at the time, well deserved booze.

Fast forward a month, and I have just given all my finals, got my 4.0 this term and I am happily preparing to go back home. I wake up one morning with an email from my email professor informing me that due to the content I uploaded he is gonna fail me in the class even if I passed it with an A. 
I immediately panic, I start freaking out.
To make matters worse, I get an email from my Physics professor with the same exact content, failing the class even though I passed it.

Now I am actually freaking the fuck out, I am an international student in the US so now I'm scared my visa is gonna get cancelled and that I am a dead man.

Next day I receive an email from the Director of Student Affairs asking to meet me to discuss the question. I'm hoping he will just give me a slap on the wrist and tell me to not do it again. I meet him and after a two hour meeting he informs me that most likely I will be expelled from the school, not allowing me to enroll at the university I was transferring to and ultimately revoking my visa. I get home and have an absolute breakdown, I can't tell my parents because they will fucking disown me so I have this weight on my back that's literally killing me. 

However, the decision wasn't final so the Director asks to meet me again the next week. Every day that passes it becomes worse. I don't know what to do with myself. I have so much shit going one that I start having suicidal thoughts, I am at the lowest point of my life (I've been lucky enough to never have experienced any real problems).
The day comes and the fucking Director tells me that he will not give me a final decision today and that he will contact me via email, due to the fact that I am leaving to go back to my home country and won't be in the States to personally see him.

I fly back home, and after approximately three days I get an email informing me that I have been suspended for the summer term, I have a 2500 word paper about Academic Integrity and my GPA has been lowered to a 1.0 for the term. However, I will be able to transfer to the University I was planning to go and I will get to keep my academic scholarship. 
Additionally, I have to write a paper of 2500 words about academic integrity that includes interview to two professors along with some other assignments that will be communicated me later.

Fast forward a couple of months and I am currently on a plane flying towards my new college, with a hue weight off my shoulders.


tl;dr I uploaded old college exams on the internet, went from a 4.0 to a 1.0 for the term, nearly got expelled and deported. 

EDIT: I forgot to add that I had to remove all the documents I uploaded, only way to do so was refunding the company that paid me via PayPal. So overall, I didn't end up earning one cent.

EDIT 2: Holy fuck this blew up way more than I expected.

I've been getting a lot of mixed reactions, people feeling bad for what happened (which they shouldn't) and people ripping my asshole apart (rightfully so).

Just to specify a few things that I might have gone over too quickly. 
The exams were semester old exams/weeks old, as I wanted to make sure nobody could benefit from the uploads as they would have been required to already take it.
Secondly my GPA for the term was lowered to a 1.0, this impacted my overall GPA a tiny bit but I was still
able to secure an academic scholarship at the university I transferred to.

I didn't post it the TIFU with the purpose of saying ""Fuck my College they are a bunch of douchebags"", it was more with the intent to show how little, at the time meaningless, actions can fuck up your future, big time.
Especially because I just assumed I would be able to do in the US things that I used to do in high school back at home.

I am grateful to the school for the course of action they took, as I know that things could have been way way worse.

I (31M) am sterile. Fiancé (27F) miraculously got pregnant. Baby looks nothing like me. How do I address this?,"We had been trying to have a baby for a few years. Eventually we found out I was sterile. We accepted it and decided to hold off on trying so hard and said that we would figure out what I do in the future. Although we weren't trying, we were continuing to have sex obviously. One day she missed her period and we found out he was pregnant. I was so happy and I thought it was amazing. We joked about how as soon as we stopped trying she ends up pregnant. The doctor said that it was a miracle baby. 

The night that the baby was born I couldn't be happier. I was just happy to finally have a baby and so excited to take her home. After a few days of taking care of her, I couldn't help but notice that she was extremely pale. For reference, I am black and she is white. I figure she would eventually darken a little and I didn't want to overthink it. 

Then our friends came over and while the girls were inside we were outback drinking. They all mentioned that they didn't want to worry me or to cause drama but asked if I ever thought my fiancé would cheat on me. I thought I was very weird and then I knew exactly where they were going with it. I said no and we talked about our concerns with the babies skin tone. However I still tried to brush it off thinking that the baby would get darker after a while. 

Now the baby is 5 months and I can't help but question if she's mine everyday. She has very fine hair. No kinks or curls, just bone straight hair. I know she's a baby but I have been around plenty of babies who still have natural curls. She is also still very pale. The thing that's been bothering me the most is that everyday she looks more and more Asian in the eyes. I don't mean to offend anyone at all but her eyes are just very stretched, they look nothing like mine. 

Is it wrong for me to be questioning my fiancé when this would have never crossed my mind before? Am I just being paranoid? How do I go about addressing this? Do I even say anything? My biggest fear is that the baby is somehow mine and she will be extremely hurt that I accused her of sleeping with someone else. I just don't know what to do. Please help me. 

Tldr; fiancé having our miracle baby after I had been confirmed to be sterile. Baby looks nothing like me. I dont want to look like an ass but I feel I need to address this. What do I do? ",relationship_advice
TIFU by asking too much from my gf's mom,"This actually happened today.

So my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. She lives up in Ohio and we reside in Florida. Well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

The last time she visited, she saw an old Wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the Wii Tennis game. I always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

Now to the fuck up.

I thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working Wii and Wii sports game for the next time she visits.

So I text her: 

Me: Hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?

Her: What's that?

Me: Bowl me! If you think you stand a chance. >:)

Her: Excuse me?

Me: You heard me, lol.

So 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.

I never said ""Bowl me"" oh no dear Reddit, I wrote ""Blow me""

Luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

TL;DR: Got Wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of Bowl me.",tifu

AITA for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?,"On my gf's birthday I gave her a necklace that I spent $400 on.  I wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but I was expecting something.

Here's how it went down.  After dinner she asked me if I was ready for my gift, I said yes and she started giving me oral.  She doesn't like giving oral and I'm ok with it.  She was giving bad oral and honestly I just wanted her to stop, then she gets up and pulls me into my room and we have sex.

I feel disappointed.   I don't think sex is a gift.  I didn't expect a gift that was equal to what I spent, but I wanted a least something.",AmItheAsshole

"Me (36M) found out my wife (34F) has been cheating on me, don't know what to do","TL:DR: Wife slept with a married guy, kept talking to him afterwards, was also at the same time having an emotional and sexual relationship online with two foreign guys. We have 3 kids and a bad financial situation. Divorce is not an easy option and we both want to try to salvage the marriage but I don't know if I can.

  
Let me start with some backstory. We've been together for almost 17 years, have 3 kids an old house we've been slowly restoring over the last 2 years and our budget is not the greatest, no savings and lots of debt.

She's the only woman I've ever been with and before me, she had only a couple of one-night stands, so we were both little experienced when we met. She's been the light of my life and we've gone through some difficult times together and always have we been there for another. I thought we were one of the few who managed to stay on course no matter what. Apparently I was wrong.

With all that was going on, trying to fix the house, both working full time, trying to make ends meet and to make sure the kids are doing fine, we kinda lost ourselves. The bad financial situation and health related issues didn't help either. My wife had been trying to lose weight for a long time but nothing seemed to work for her and her self esteem was down to the floor. We were both depressed, but instead of talking and consoling one another, we suffered in silence. I buried my nose in computer games to hide from our problems while she had her nose in her phone all the time. This spring and summer, things started going worse. She was spending more time with her friends and going partying, while I stayed at home with the kids. I thought that if I let her „blow off some steam"" that she would come home in a better mood, but that didn't work at all.

I tried to ignore the bad feeling that was starting to sink in my stomach. I had heard a rumor that she had been seen kissing some dude at a dance in a nearby town. I confronted her about it, but she denied and said that the guy had tried to kiss her, but she pushed him away. I was not fully convinced, but didn't want to push her too much as I was trying to let her see that I trusted her. Yet as the summer passed, I noticed she was getting way more protective and secretive about her phone. After seing by chance what her FB password was one night in august 22nd, I decided to taka a look, to see if I could find anything about that dance earlier that summer. What I found was way worse.

I saw that indeed she had been kissing some dude drunk as hell until her friend pulled her out of it, but that's nothing compared to what I saw next. I accessed her Messenger and Skype.

I found out that she had been chatting online with two foreign guys, A and B, for months. It had started on Instagram, some random dude, A, sent her some flattering messages and she started talking to him on Skype after that in early June. After only speaking to him for less than two weeks she started sharing with him nude photos after only resisting a bit. The incident with the guy she kissed happened later that month. She was chatting with this guy A up until midst of August, when he showed his real intention, he was a scammer with a stolen account and was just sending her pictures from that stolen profile. Yet she had been fooled enough to share with him pictures of her most intimate parts. She seemed like she was falling in love with him. By then she was already started to talk to guy B, which also started on Instagram. Didn't take long for that to evolve to nude pictures and sexual talk. In both cases they were fantasizing about them coming to our country and meet with my wife at a hotel. She never spoke ill of me or anything like that, just talked about me like I was just there. If they asked, she said that I treated her well, but then she went on to tell them how she like to talk to them and they made her feel good. The worst is yet to come.

In one of the chats with a female friend of hers I found some more disturbing things. They went together to a 2 day town festival in another nearby town in early july, stayed at a rented room, which I of course had agreed to and thought would be ok, and I knew that my wife's friend who has trouble with panic attacks had needed to stay overnight at the local hospital. But what I didn't know and saw in that chat between them was that she mentioned a 41 year old guy from our own town (guy C), a married man with kids, who was unhappy in his relationship and she had met him that night. He had come over to chat and had tried to „go all the way"" but my wife told her friend that she had stopped him. She didn't mention the name, but I found out a likely suspect as our town is small and I also found in my online phone records that she had sent a message to a number belonging to a guy that fit the description. I feared the worst.

I didn't let my wife know what I had found yet, as I was afraid what would happen while the kids were around, so I put up a mask and waited until saturday 24th of august to confront my wife. I had called my mother and got her to take care of the kids. My wife is taking some classes to get some form of degree for her work and when she came home from class I asked her calmly to sit with me and I told her about what I knew. There was no violence, yelling or bad mouthing. Just two sad people, one of them angry and hurt, and we talked the whole night. She promised that nothing had happened between her and „C"" and what she had done online was only to try boosting her self esteem a bit as she thought I had stopped loving her. She didn't exactly try to blame me for it, nor did she yell at me for snooping around. She said she thought I didn't like her anymore because she wasn't losing weight and when those guys started raining compliments on her she said she got addicted. She said she didn't mean to hurt me, she was selfish and tried to please them as she could so they would keep complimenting her, therefore sending them nude pictures. She told me that she saw it now that she had been cheating on me but she hadn't realised it while she was doing it, even though she knew she was doing something wrong.

I wanted to believe her, I truly did. But I had concerns. We decided to try to fix our marriage and seek counseling. As the weeks passed, things seemed to be getting better. She's been way more affectionate to me and caring. Our sex life has been great and we've been spending way more time together than before. I still had a growing feeling in my stomach that she was hiding some critical information from me and after our second meeting with the marriage counselor last week, she finally admitted the truth. She admitted what I had suspected and feared but deeply hoped hadn't happened. She had indeed slept with C that night in july. And even though she said she had felt bad afterwards and shameful, she still kept talking to him via social media. She admitted to have met with him twice after that, but nothing more than a bit of kissing. She even tried to contact him again a few days after I had confronted her in august.

My first response after that was simply freezing. I didn't yell or curse or anything. I din't harm her in anyway. I partly felt relieved that she had finally admitted what I suspected, but at the same time I felt humiliated and hurt beyond anything I've ever felt before. I didn't want to rush to anything so I haven't thrown the ring in her face yet, nor have I confronted the other guy, as I don't want to be the person to rat on him to his wife or make myself get arrested for assault. Besides, it wasn't him that broke my marriage contract, it was my wife.

I don't know what to believe anymore. The woman I thought I knew would never do something like this. She's been trying to convince me that she was an idiot and selfish and whatnot and that she feels really bad about hurting me like that. She says she's ready to do anything to fix the situation and to get me to trust her again and feel like she's worthy again. 

Honestly I don't know if I'll ever trust her again or see her with the same eyes. I do love her of course and I like to be around her, and see her smile. But at the same time it stings my heart. I want this to work because of the kids and our shitty financial situation, as we can't afford going through divorce, but I fear that I will lose myself and never gain any self respect if I go through with this.

How the hell can I forgive her for cheating on me with not only one guy but three? Well, four, if you count that one time she kissed a random guy. She was both emotionally as well as physically cheating with all of them for some period of time. Not just a one drunk night mistake, but some kind of emotional and sexual relationship with three guys for over 2 months. Doesn't matter if two of those relationships were online. She still planned to meet with them, knowing fully what would happen if they did.

Has anyone here gone through anything similar to this and has some good advice? I know it's easy to say: „just divorce her man and move on"", but it's not that simple. I still have feelings for her and I don't know what will happen with our kids and our families. I also fear that if I dicorce her, which will mean that her family and friends will know the truth, that she will harm herself or at least be in a mental state where she will have bad influence on our kids. We also have an unfinished house and no savings and need at least to finish fixing it in order to get any cash out of selling it.",relationship_advice
"NSFW In honor of my Father, his favorite joke of all time. No one could tell it like he did.","Christmas was coming and Little Johnny's Mom and Dad took him to the mall to a see Santa Claus.

Johnny walked up and sat on Santa's lap and said ""Santa, for Christmas I want a god damn new baseball bat and I want it to be put under my god damn bed.  I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree.  And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.""

Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny's parents aside and said ""In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.""

His parents replied ""We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior.  We've tried everything.""

Santa thought about it and said ""Here's what we'll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we'll put a pile of dog poop.""  The parents agreed to try Santa's plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed.  Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.  

Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.  After a while his parents asked him sarcastically ""So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?""

Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said ""I think I got a god damned dog, but I can't find the motherfucker!""

My account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


I went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. He said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. I get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but I said I still wanted to press charges. The officer said I literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

So i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

I was refunded the 5k to my account, but now I have a shit load of overdraft fees because I use PayPal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, HBO, etc.) Every time PayPal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. I've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but I only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. I do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and I can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. Every time I check my account, it's just further in the negative and I don't know what to do.

AITA if I back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? Best man is my ex fiancé who cheated on me and I can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.,"Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fiancé for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

I confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

And on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

I've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

Woukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?

Edit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I'm so sorry I haven't been reading I'll try and catch up

Edit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""Panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


Edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiancé not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiancé to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by buying a used PlayStation 2 on Letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.,"This happened only minutes ago.


The graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


At the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


Now, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?


Starting to sound like a mistake yet?


If the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2's from later in the console's production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.


My first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.


Back at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I'm off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn't read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.


Now I'm starting to get slightly pissed. I'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


I open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I've now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.


Oh golly gee fuck was I wrong.


Now at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It's putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I'm sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


I experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


You see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.


Oh, that's not all rust.

Do you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, ""Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they're crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


They're getting everywhere now. I'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


At least, I *hope* I finished the job. I'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I'm a little too emotionally drained to care. I also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that I *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet.

TL;DR: I bought a used PS2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

Edit: Hi, Reddit! I just wanted to say many thanks for the gold AND all the offers for cockroach-free PlayStations!  warms my heart, and I'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. Happy Redditing!",tifu

AITA for mentioning that I had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor?,"I'm posting this from my wife's account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I'm the asshole. 

This is a topic we've been debating for the past almost two years now. It'd be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

My perspective (husband):

My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. 

After eating something delicious, I can't quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I'm talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn't want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife's contractions started to pick up. 

Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

Wife's perspective:

My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he'd complain I'd say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn't in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. 

I'd like to also mention it wasn't just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours.

Boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship,"My bf and I have been together for over 4 years. When we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. We stayed together long distance until I graduated and moved back home. We have lived together for about 2 years now. 

Life was very rough for him when he dropped out. His parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. He is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. Because of this, I have lent him money over the years. I was very fortunate in my situation where I went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. I have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. One thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. I am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

Last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. He told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. Because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. My perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. Sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (For example, we moved last week and I wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) It makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. But he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

I am very confused about our relationship right now. He will not remember this when he wakes up, but I don't know how to approach him with the things he said. I love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. But if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should I be doing?

Edit: I've changed the ocd to perfectionist. I'm so sorry to everyone I offended!

Edit 2: I'm crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. Thank you to everyone who responded, I love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don't get a lot of love in their lives. 

A little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. Because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. Neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. That was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",relationship_advice
