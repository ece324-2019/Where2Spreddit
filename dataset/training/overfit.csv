"by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again. i'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because i'm an idiot. 

my dentist is a very nice and professional man. our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" my immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! you've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" i did not intend to make a sexual joke. his face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

i had my second dentist appointment today. i actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. he had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. his face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. i was a bit concerned and also confused. like how could i have embarrassed him this time? i had hardly spoken! so he keeps working in there and then i realize what the hell is happening. my dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. i had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

never going back.

we talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  this has not helped.  we escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

the principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  the read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  the principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

"my ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), i was starting to heal until i found out the reasons why he ghosted. the past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. i'm not sure if i'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

my ex, 'tom', and i had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so i thought. we had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). i was happy, and i thought he was too. we had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, i could go on. 

everything was fine until our last trip together. we went to a destination where i had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something i'd have to wait longer to do. it was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

after we landed (the last time i saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. i didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. i tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. i started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. from there our communication basically broke down. i can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. from that point i'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. after about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then i wouldn't hear from him for several more days. what hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with new years, valentine's day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

i felt like i was going crazy. i had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  i was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. i stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. i found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse i could think of whenever i showed up somewhere without him. 

i eventually broke down, i contacted one of his good friends who i felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. i told her that tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and i have no idea what's going on. i told her i didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that i needed to know about. she looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and i that i was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. this was soul crushing to hear and i felt humiliated and worthless. i told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. she said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

throughout march and april i felt like i was starting to heal some. i felt broken, but i started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. i told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. then i found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

he had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. not sure how long, but a little less than a year. i'm also hurt because i know the person he cheated on me with. she's an absolute garbage person. and i'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. she has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. i've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the lgbt community and non-christians. she is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. she somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. i think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, i'm really not sure. i can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. i've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. her parents have paid for her car and i think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. she spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and i frequent and will interject herself into our outings. she has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew i wouldn't approve. then he started to get high and then have sex with her. he felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. his intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. this woman hated my guts, and kept pushing tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. he didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. so she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. he came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

i only found out about this, because the same friend i had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that i deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. there is no way in hell that i'd get back together with tom
2. i can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and i'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. i don't know if i could contain my urge to slap him, or if i would just break down and sob. i was doing well from moving on from him. i was starting to feel happy again. now, i think i'm back at square 1. i'm depressed and stressed out. 

is there anything i can do? i kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",8
"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

"not sure how to deal with my 37f anti-vaxx husband 35m since i want to get our kids vaccinated at first i assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  we were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

it's been 6 years. six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

first, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and i decided to take her to the er.  

thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

he said all the things i've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. he explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

i tried to explain that i agree, but i feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes i was respecting up until now.

he ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

on the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

i look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

i won't do this anymore. although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

can i just take them myself?  we always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

what can i say so he won't go? how can i keep this form him, or should i tell him once it's done?

please help

if i was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. help me help my children this is no different. for those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky. i thought he would eventually let them get vaccines but now it's just excuse after excuse.",8

"watching incest porn *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

this happened yesterday. i was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. i will state, for the record, i do not advocate incest. my girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. all i wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so i went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. that's all this was. research. 

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

i frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what i do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

dad: suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids. 

me: 

i immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home.

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

"update they removed all the cats from my mom's house. animal control and the police were called, and it took them until today to get here. over the weekend i took my mother to a hotel, and she said she was happy that i cleaned up for some mother-daughter time. she also thanked me for getting her a new bed. she couldn't comprehend that we weren't in her house. 

 animal control, with a lot of help confiscated all the cats except two, and all of the birds. for those debating it, no it was not a swan, but a young duck. i should probably have known, but i wasn't going to take a second peek into that room. the total cat count was 213, and the total bird count was 87. there were a significant amount more that were, unfortunately, dead. many of the cats were sick, and may have to be euthanized.

my mother is extremely upset, she has been admitted to the hospital for reasons i would rather not get into. i don't know if the house is saveable, the situation is still being assessed. i'm sorry it's not a happy update, but at least i'm no longer drowning in cats.",2
"my ex proposed. i said no. he is now talking about suing me. advice? just want to say this is going to sound insane but i am not trolling/making it up.

me and this guy were together for 3 years. we're 19 now. we never talked about the future until a year in. before then i'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

in short, i wanted kids, he didn't. i wanted to stay in ireland, he didn't. i wanted to get married, he didn't. when i realised it was a bad match i broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. this happened a few times over the next 18 months in this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

we knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something i would want further down the line, i wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. if i were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then i might have an issue, but when i'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

when i went to see him this time i was again, considering breaking up with him. aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that i really don't like. so when i arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, i assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so i wouldn't cause a scene. i don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

in the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. first he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff i liked and what my taste was. i assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so i told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. i also said ""go cheap"".

the other thing he asked me was how i felt about public proposals. i told him immediately that i, personally, disliked them as i felt i wouldn't be able to say no, even if i wanted to. i feel like public proposals are ok when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not ok at all. i assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

i never thought in a million years that he would propose.

so you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

the ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. he got on one knee, and held it out to me. we were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

i said no.

well, i didn't so much say ""no"". i ran out of the restaurant.

he drove me there, so i got a cab back, and drove home that night.

i realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but i didn't know what else to do. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all i knew was that i didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. i felt like i couldn't even speak, i was so upset about the whole thing. so i just got up and ran.

i just want to take the opportunity to say here that i really really don't care about the rings. honestly, when i want to get married (which is absolutely not when i'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and i'd say yes. i wouldn't even need a ring. i know i'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what i'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

i didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. he said that he thought a proposal was something i'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. he said that he was out of pocket for the rings. he'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. he linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). when i asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped i would cover the cost of mine. he said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. he'd hoped that i would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but i said no. he also said i'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if i was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

we both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on sunday.

he has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that i have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which i had no part in spreading. he says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. so €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

i think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but i am not a law student or a lawyer. he is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

what do i do about all of this? do i need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

thanks in advance :)

edit:  he knew i wanted to get married but not to him. he not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. he openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and i told him that this was why i was breaking up with him the times before this that i have ended the relationship. during the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like i'm gonna propose"" (that one was last april)

"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

(tldr: had a stroke at age 29, almost died, had brain surgery, recovered, went back to work only to have a seizure my first day back caused by the stroke and am still awaiting return to work)

"by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina 12 hours before my first ""grown up job"" interview, i was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company's grounds. considering i smoke weed daily i started looking up ways to pass a drug test. i came to the conclusion that i was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. i had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they're just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

unfortunately i was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time i had to prepare, but knowing that i wouldn't be able to pass if the temperature wasn't correct i had the idea to stick it up my vagina. i tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so i could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

fast forward to the interview.
it was an hour and a half away so i decided to wait till i got there to insert it. i did it in my car w some coconut oil before i walked in just incase they decided to drug test me first. i walked in and everything was fine, i signed in and they told me to take a seat. as soon as i sat down i knew something was wrong. i went to the bathroom to make sure i could still take it out. i began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn't move. i tugged again and the string broke. at this point i'm freaking out. i try getting it out with my fingers but i can't reach it. the only ""tools"" i have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. so in a 3 piece suit and heels, i squat and begin to use these ""tools"" to try and remove the bottle. about 4 min go by and i'm really freaking out but need to go back incase they called my name. i walk out and the hr rep sees me and asks if i'm okay. i tell her i have a tampon stuck up my vagina that i can't get out and that's why i'm freaking out. she then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, i ask her if i can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. obviously that didn't work. so she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... still didn't work. at this point i just have to do the interview. it lasted 3 hours and i had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

when the interview finally ends i rush to the closest urgent care where i have to explain to the doctors why there's a 5 hour energy in my vagina. at this point i'm convinced i just don't have the right tools and they'll get it out in no time. upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it's also sideways. her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle in my vagina and then fish it out. ~luckily~ they just sent me to the er instead. 

so now i'm at the er where they then inform me that since it's behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since i wasn't actually giving birth my body wasn't dilated and they couldn't remove the bottle without putting me under.  

well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.
i didn't get the job and i didn't even get drug tested. 

tldr: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. after 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the er it was finally removed

edit: this isn't made up. idk if i have all the ""anatomy"" right i guess? yes it was very painful. yes, i have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don't believe me

i'm just telling you guys what the doctors told me. they might have just told me a dumbed down version without the right medicinal terminology, idk

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

"update overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

so i read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, i was doubting if i made the right decesion. i wasn't going to update because i didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days i came to a final conclusion.i want to clarify that i broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

after i broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. she would send me letters and call me a lot. in one of the texts i actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. i was about to agree, but something she said made me realize i would be making a mistake if i did. she said, ""i'll remember to respect from now on."" that sentence made me realize that i made the right choice by breaking up. since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

either way i'm glad i didn't give her a second chance. i don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

on a sidenote, the other day i was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and i guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that i moved on to fast. blocked her and had a laugh i know for a fact i made the right choice.",8
"a bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back. basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. my account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


i went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. he said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. i get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but i said i still wanted to press charges. the officer said i literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

so i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

i was refunded the 5k to my account, but now i have a shit load of overdraft fees because i use paypal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, hbo, etc.) every time paypal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. i've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but i only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. i do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and i can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. every time i check my account, it's just further in the negative and i don't know what to do.

"new york - i've been visited by cps 8 times, to enquire about a child i don't have. at what point it becomes harassment or stalking? there's a cps agent that seems to be convinced that i have a child and i'm locking the child in my home. first time i was visited, i was very understanding. i allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. everything seemed fine. obviously no child and no evidence of one, because i don't have a child.

this was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until i stopped cooperating. i told her that from now on the only way i'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. a few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. the officer told me that it will be a lot easier if i allowed them to look at my house, i allowed the officer to do that by himself. again, no child was found. his search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times i have refused to talk to her. once, as i left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. it definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. i called the police but it went nowhere. i have called the cps office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. this last incident happened this last thursday.

this woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. everyone has told her that i don't have a child. 

this definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. if this was a legitimate cps operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, i'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance i guess? but they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. so maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

this is really going too far and is affecting my life. i actually fear for my safety now. i will install security cameras this week and will call the police if i found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the cps.

do i have a legal recourse here? like filing a restraining order against the cps (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? this definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. not sure how stalking is defined legally. what's the best way to stop her?

so last night my girlfriend and i decided to go out to the bars. got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. well last night was the first time we decided to use them. we read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. everything went well but afterwards we couldn't find the plug. this is where the begins. 

we figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. gfs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she's a little extra hungover no big deal. we arrive at mcds to get some greasy hangover food. i order while gf heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. as i take our order back to our table, gf walks over in a panic saying we need to leave now.

she found the butt plug. in our drunken state, we managed to put the entire thing in her ass. handle and all. and now it's sitting at the bottom of a mcdonalds toilet in all its glory. 

tl;dr: did not use a butt plug as directed.",4

"by fingering a girl obligatory this happened yesterday. this girl and i had a fun filled day out on the town. afterwards we got a hotel. things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. one thing led to another and i started fingering her. she was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that i was doing a decent job. a good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. i'm sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. i call her name and start panicingly shaking her. she's not responsive and i slap her face. as soon as i did this she starts having a seizure. now i'm freaking the out. i jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. i'm about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. she's giving me this wtf just happened look and i tell her what happened. at first she tells me she doesn't believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. she said that when she has a seizure it's best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. i just sat there in that ""thank god i didn't finger a girl to death"" state. needless to say our sexy time ended right there.

"by leaving thc chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles my cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of thc chocolate for christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. my parents are 75-year old republicans. that was a big maybe.

&#x200b;

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

&#x200b;

you can guess what happened. my mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. her last words, high as a kite, were ""i think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200b;

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

&#x200b;

anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. so now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

tl;dr - mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"by fulfilling a cuckolds fantasy obligatory this is a throwaway and this happened last winter yada yada yada.

&#x200b;

i had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but i still swiped out of boredom. they were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. only boob. there was no picture of her husband. i take a few shots and message them.  after like an hour of talking, i decide to just do it. we never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. at first i was like really not for it, i originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and i was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. at 2am i left the house, and this is where i regret everything.

&#x200b;

after driving for about an hour, i miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped two of my tires. i'm in a shitty ghetto town that i've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how i'm getting home now. i thought i was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. but since there was no turning back now, i decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

&#x200b;

edit: i'm really glad i was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it's at my own expense, i'm laughing with you. a lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. i hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness.",4

"by trying to edit a headshot without permission, hr is involved. tl;dr at bottom.

i work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. a portion of what i do is handling the corporate website. one of our mid-level professionals (i'll call her gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. it's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.

every year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. it's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.

so, gina's paper is being published, and i'm called on to do all the marketing around it. this includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.

the thing is, gina's headshot is a little... off.

as a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. not a little ""maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch"" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.

so, i can't exactly call up and ask if i should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation i want to have, and i'm also not known as the most tactful person. i'm very familiar with photoshop, and use it all the time (i've got no graphic design qualifications though, so i'm very slow by comparison), so i go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. i'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.

i work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. still, it's not something i want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, i alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.

lo and behold, gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. as she comes by, i hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. she comes in and freezes, asks what i'm doing. i say im just tweaking a picture, and when i look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.

she gets louder and asks what the fuck i'm doing fixing her chest area. she then asks if i'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. for some reason, i decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say i'm evening out the skin tone.

she dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.

about an hour later, i get an email from hr saying that i need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  i ask if i can speak privately first, and explain the situation. i still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and ""make her prettier"". i acknowledge that, but also mention that i tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, i'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. 

we have the meeting, and i had to explain the whole thing to gina directly. she is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. she's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). she then goes on to suggest that i altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).

i then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the hr rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.

she's still livid, and hr suggest that i should jump off this project. 

i'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. i told my boss the whole story and he's assured me i'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.

tl:dr: tried to edit a moustache out of a female colleague's professional headshot, didn't want to embarrass her by letting other people see, she walks by and i reflexively scroll down to hide the mouth and it looks like i'm zoomed in on her breasts. ",4
"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: wow, this got very big. it's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

and alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so i might have a warped view on this one.

"serious just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive. a few days ago i was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

i decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until i decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

here's the joke i told:

""what do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

throw your washing (laundry if you're american) in.""

one of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. when i asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

obviously i felt mortified as i didn't know about it, and said ""i'm so sorry to hear that. did he drown?""

"for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment? i have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only i can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. all the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but i told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

things worked pretty well at first but over time i caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. after the third or so time i sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. they all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and i told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

i came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

thanks to everyone who gave me advice before :)

"i got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. after 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. i need help on how to handle this. 
i am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

at 16 i slep with my good friend jared . the condom broke and my daughter was created. my parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. i couldn't bring it over myself to. i wanted to keep the baby. ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. so i did. i went to my friends house and his parents took me in. they weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

in that time my friend and i started to develop feelings for each other.

i had my daughter and about 2 moths later jared's  brother  came back into their life's. he was a recovering heroin addict. as we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. my parents got wind of that. they dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my mil also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

so they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. it was a dark time i thought they were going to take my baby. in the end they didn't find anything substantial.

but them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. as it was a small town every mistake i made got back to my parents.

i was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? cps charges because neglect.
i was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . cps.

christmas loads of people stayed at jared's house because it was a big family. cps because many strange men were there.

they eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. if they had done it more i think it could have been an offence.

the last call was 5 years ago.

eventually jared and i married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. we worked retail jobs and studied. it took us longer than average to graduate but we did. with a lot of help of his parents. jared is now an engineer and i work as a graphic designer.

we were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. our life's look normal now.

anyway a week ago i get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

i don't really know what to do. because while they didn't have to take care of my while i was pregnant i wished they had at least supported me. and while i get that they were panicking because they thought i was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",8

"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

so me being the master of wit that i am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! if i say the right thing i could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
my brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was

""i'll finger you""

not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
because of the level of noise i  the factory i have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. it just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
at this point i wanted to just crawl into a hole, but i stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""i meant that as though you're a cow, not that i actually want to finger you""

this seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
i can't look jess in the eye any more. works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

tl/dr:  female workmate said i looked like i was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response i said ""i'll finger you."" now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

edit 2: holy shit,  platinum?? anonymous platinum giver, if you were a cow i would definitely finger you😂",4
"when i was hired i was given a key and told if i lose it i owe $15,000. i lost it. do i have to pay up? i am located in michigan.  

okay so when i was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) i was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  i was told that if i ever lost said key i would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

i have lost this key.  (it was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. i was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

so now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money i owe.""   i have received letters from their official letterhead and i am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. and they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

i have no intention of paying the fine.

the catch is that i was told this was the consequence verbally when i was handed the key.  my supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   i replied with ""to be clear, i will not be paying that if i haven't signed yet.  do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  my supervisor laughed as though i was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

well he never brought it up again and i of course did not either.  

my question is.  can i be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" at this point i have not reminded them that i never signed.  i have simply ignored them.  but i worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and i'm not sure how to proceed.  i will be visiting my lawyer monday.  so hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. i can not afford this ""charge.""

"if it's socially acceptable for women to put ""sorry, no short men"" as a requirement in online dating profiles, then it should also be acceptable for men to say ""sorry, no flat-chested women"", or ""no overweight women"" in theirs. i understand that a women may only want a guy of a certain height for whatever reason they may have. that's fine. you are attracted to who you are attracted to and there is nothing wrong with that. 

maybe she just wants to warn a guy before wasting their time with meeting up somewhere, or stop them from getting their hopes up. i get that too. 

however, if a man were to say  ""sorry, no (blank)  women"", they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

it's a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. whereas someone would say of the woman ""oh, she's just very selective and knows what she wants"", they would say of the man ""what a pig! how dare he!"". no one would ever say ""he's just very selective and wants to find the perfect soul mate"".

"by laughing at my son while he was saying his prayers so, my 6 year old often likes to make up his own prayers at night time and it's adorable.  

so,  tonight,  he was kneeling at his bed in his jammies looking so cute i could just eat him.  


him: ""dear lord jesus, please watch over me as i sleep tonight. please look over mommy and daddy and teachers and friends too and the friends i haven't met yet. 

thank you for dinner and inventing minecraft ...""

*i chuckle lightly*

him: *turning to me angrily* ""it's not funny!!""

me: ""i'm sorry sweetie, i won't do it again""

him: *resuming his prayer* ""and please don't let my toys come alive tonight. amen""

and he hopped into bed. 

my stifled laugh sounded like a loud pig snorting, so i just layed my face down in his blankets and pretended like i was praying deeply as i tried to compose my self. 

then i got up quickly trying to hide my face, and i sneaked one last look to say good night as i shut the door and he was giving me the death glare. 



edit: thank you so much for the likes, comments,  gold and silver!  i really didn't think it was going to make it to the front page ! 

i actually thought it was going to get removed or downvoted because of our religion! i didn't realize so  many people have such hate towards people who believe in a higher power! 😥 it convinces me to keep teaching my son to love and to show respect to everyone no matter what they believe in. 

 i had a lot of fun reading everyone's comments.  they were very funny.  i am very thankful!😊😊

"adopt an adult dog from a shelter if you want a companion but don't have time/ patience to train a puppy. they are already potty trained in most cases and love you all the same. plus there are a lot of them. it's a win win for every one involved.

edit:  so as a few people pointed out,  adult dogs are not perfect and can come with some quirks.  make sure you do your research and are fully prepared to take on the responsibility of a pet whether it's a puppy or an adult. 

also,  check with the shelter staff about obedience training. they often know good schools or sometimes even do it in house. 

please adopt responsibly.

edit 2: wow rip my inbox. thank you kindly for the golds and even a silver!  im glad this lpt has reached so many people because that means so many people are more aware about the joy of adopting adult dogs from shelters, and it's also been great reading the comments about how people have adopted adult dogs and are so loving in their families.

edit 3: don't forget about cats!

edit last:  man i've loved seeing all the sweet stories of adoption in all the comments. and i've learned a lot from the not so sweet stories as well, they are a great balance to the rose tinted glasses as it were.

"my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please so here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. my girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, i finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company i did my internship at and within a year i got a promotion and a large payraise and i am now making roughly 150k a year, while she makes 20k a year.

now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place i bought so i pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, phone bill, netflix and so forth.

now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently i pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

now she seems to be jealous i got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs i put the majority in my savings account.

in my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

so what do i do, i hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if i am honest i am questioning my relationship as there is no way i am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

edit: so, there are so many comments i am having a hard time keeping up with it. if i don't respond, know that i am trying to at least read your comment. but currently when i read and respond to 1 comment i get 10 more! haha. i just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... even those who yell about mgow or something and those who are if the opinion i need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! i had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha.",8
"banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat. in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

i used to take the bus daily to get to work. not a big deal, i'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

but every thursday was awful. every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. still, generally not an issue because i'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

but this bus company was not reliable. we have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. one day, a little school bus came instead. it had 9 seats. since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. so you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

i have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, i needed that time to sit down. so, that's what i was doing, as always.

the group gets on the bus, i've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. i look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. i take out my earbuds and she says to me that i need to give up my seat. the other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when i tell her i need it she says that i need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. i try my best to explain that medically i can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says i'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). so after a couple minutes of this i snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as i'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. she gives me a look like i just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

two days later when i tried to get on the bus i was told i was banned from the service.

when i called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. i explained the medical reasons i needed it and was simply told i have a lower priority because i'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as i ever knew. he ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as i know, but i feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

on my original post it was suggested a lot that i make a post here. i live in ontario, canada. i don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. i know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

anyway that's why i'm here for help. am i in the right to sue? for how much? i don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

edit: there's a lot of responses on here so i'm sorry if i don't get to everyone, but for now i will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the ontario human rights legal support center on monday. thanks everyone. i'll still be accepting further advice if there is more i should do though obviously i can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

edit: i gave them a call. it went well, should be covered from here. thanks all.",2

"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time? i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

am i the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

"by pitching a really fucking stupid slogan to my only cool client i'm in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. so, a few days ago i was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: they had an uncharacteristically shitty location.

there's no way people were just finding this place on their own. it was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. so, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

last night, i went there to get some food... for research, ya know... anyway, i was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. the pizza was really good. the beer selection was varied. they had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. pretty good stuff. even if i wasn't writing for them, i would've given them 5 stars on yelp, is what i mean.

when i was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

i wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""where wine country is next door!""), but i was determined to get something usable. 

finally, it hit me: ""go somewhere."" it had nearly everything i wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

but, still, it wasn't quite there. it lacked the feel i wanted, felt a little too abstract. customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. they needed to be pointed.

after another hour or so, i had it.

eventually, the slogan i pitched these poor people was this:

""go somewhere else""

which, i believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""get the fuck out of my face.""

they haven't emailed me back.

tl;dr: today i fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan i wrote and i'm pretty sure i definitely lost a client because of it.",4
"(unpopular for cannabis users) i think weed culture is awful. i use cannabis everyday, i would be considered a ""stoner"" by most people. weed culture is childish, cringy and counterproductive to the destigmatization of this wonderful drug. i would rather kick myself in the balls than own anything with a cannabis leaf drawn on it, wether it's shirt, a hat, an ashtray, a rolling tray, a poster a tattoo, a bong or a fucking sticker. people whose apparent jobs are to smoke weed on youtube make me sick and if you look at recipes for edibles they will invade your reccomended videos.

 i went to a legal shop here in montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there. they turned bob marley, a man who sang songs of love and unity, and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed. every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes, if anything, canadians should celebrate 10/17 (the day cannabis was legalized federally). and dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs.

 every dealer i have had until my current suppliers have been arrogant douchebags who try and tell you you are ""smoking wrong"" and think they are your friends. i know it's shitty to bag on how people enjoy things but weed culture makes all cannabis users looks immature, lazy and stupid.

"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them? i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty? my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"i(22m) recently discovered my dad (50m) choose me over my former stepmother and half-sister(17f) 6 years ago. don't know how to process this. i was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. when i was sent to live with my dad, i was broken. i barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  i wasn't mad or angry. i was null of any kind of emotion. basically i was alive but wasn't living. i kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. i was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. i was more social with my dad but i kept it to a bare minimum.  i had noting left to say to anyone. it took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. that's how withdrawn i had become.

dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  when i experienced night- terrors, i would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  he drove me to all of my therapist appointments. he made sure i was eating properly. there were days, i would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. he literally went above and beyond for me. i hated the city that were living in. because  i had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

i was so passive, it was scary. my therapist had told my dad that i was stuck in the victim's cycle; i didn't know how to get out. because of this, i was bullied quite a bit. by the time i was 15, i had been to 3 different schools. it got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. i was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. noting would motivate me.

looking back, dad did spoil me but at the time i wasn't aware of it. i was so in my own body that i barley acknowledged my surroundings.   if i asked my dad for a new bed spread, i would get me new one plus new furniture. my phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. i was grateful and thanked him. i did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. again i was being polite. i didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. i barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

by the time i was 16, dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. i didn't question it. he had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. i didn't think it was any of my business so i didn't press the issue. a year later, dad had divorced my stepmother. one of dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in boston and he took it. we moved and i felt i was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. that year was probably the best year of my life. i was coming out of my shell. there was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. it was if i was like everyone else. i felt ""normal"". i became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, i was going out more. us moving probably saved my life.

because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. there was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. you could just sense it. it got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

me and dad have always been close. when i had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, i could see my dad crying in the crowd. i lived with my dad while i attended college ( i still do for the time being) . ever since i was child, i always wanted to be a doctor. well, i just finished my first year of medical school. honestly, i feel like a normal young adult in society. i have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom i've been with for 4 years. i'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

recently, i got fb message from my half-sister. she was apologizing a lot and i had no clue what she was talking about. turns out, the reason why dad and i moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what i was watching her change........... yes. she told her mom that i was watching her change.. at the time, i was traumatized of sex. heck i was terrified of any form of intimacy. the kid was envious of what dad was doing for me. she was so envious that she tried to move me out. well i guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and i'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. because we moved out, i think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. how can someone be so cruel? what did i ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. i didn't even respond. more importantly, dad never let this to get back to me. chances are if i had heard about this when i was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. it also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

this is a lot to take in and i have a new found of respect and love for my dad. he gave up this marriage for me so i could live a normal life.dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. i'm missing him a lot lately.

should i bring it up to him when he returns? also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? at the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and i almost want to help.

tl;dr: dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. dad kept it from me for 6 years. should i bring up with him?

edit: i wasn't expecting such a huge response. i just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. it will take some time but i will read all of them or as much as i can. as i was going through the comments, i found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. this a part of my life. i don't normally like to talk about about this . aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. the fact the people are saying that it's fake.... i don't what to say. it's not my place to try and convince anyone. believe  me, they're times i wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. when i wrote this, i wasn't thinking about syntax. it was more just getting this out. people questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. forgive me but i wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

as for how i became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; i did respond to it in the comments but i'll post it here too. 

""it was very unorthodox how i became valedictorian after attending a real hs for only a year. my overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because i was in online classes for my previous hears, i wasn't eligible at the time. i met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

i broke down in front of the coordinator and i told her the truth. being named valedictorian was something i always wanted. to be that would have been my first accomplishment that i would have achieved based on my own merit. yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. it wasn't trying to be valedictorian financial reasons. money wasn't a problem (dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. this would have helped me self-worth as well.

the girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and i told her the truth. she actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. it something i'll forever be grateful for. that's actually how me and her became friends."". not many people would do that and in hs.

"for having an almanac? a bit of backstory. i met my wife in the summer of 2008. she was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. i had gone to pick up some boxes because i was moving. out walked my sara...it was close to the end of her shift. and working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (seriously, i don't care what ddd says, that place is gross.) she was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...i'm pretty sure i fell in love right then and there that wonderful may night. (inb4 ""thats so old fashioned!!!"" don't care. when you know, you know.) i wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
it started after our first date. she had mentioned she loves lilacs. me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know jack or shit about flowers. but the way she talked about how much she loved them i knew i didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. so i wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (think what cops use to take notes.) this was the almanacs genesis. over the years i've written down information about my wife. her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. basically all the little things i knew i would forget. anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. i would go through it every once in a while so i could do something sweet for her. fast forward to yesterday morning.
i get a call from her around 11am. ""what the fuck is the almanac?"" (the almanac is written on the cover. it's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) she obviously has it, and i don't lie to my wife, so i tell her. she gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""i always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. i get home from work last night and she's really dejected. i asked her what's wrong and she says the almanac has cheapened every sweet thing i've ever done for her. she called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. mind you i've never showed it to a single soul nor have i even told anyone about it. until yesterday i was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (she also said she hasn't decided if i can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) i'm kind of heart broken. i feel like this should be an example of how much i love her. i'm terrified she's going to burn it. i want to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. that's why i write them down. i don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. i do it because i love my wife. i hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and i don't want to be that guy. so yeah, i took notes. and now i'm getting the silent treatment. or at best single word answers.

"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

tl;dr: convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

edit: wow this blew up?! i don't have a ton of time but:

1) i don't want to upload the video. i made it sound tamer than it was, i look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xd

2) the tvs in the hospital had hdmi ports. i just plugged it into my chromebook. 

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4

"by not openning a gift for 1.5 years this actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. i was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. we got on well and i was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country i decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. i thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so i kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

in the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. it was all a blur but i kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what i think. well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided not to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). we met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but i was prepared and considered that was it.

the box stayed in my fridge for i dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? she went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and i also met somebody else. one day i was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously i still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then i saw a full page note from her. she basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

i just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. i probably looked like an asshole for how i acted when i last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am i..

tl;dr: got a gift from a girl i really liked but decided not to open it after 1.5 years, totally ignoring her note for me hidden inside.",4

"minor daughter refuses abortion. tw: sex, minor

throwaway for obvious reasons. i'm still shook and my boyfriend and i have been freaking out since we found out. i'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

our daughter is 11 years old. we found out she was pregnant. she had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. we never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

it was clear she had a crush on him, but i never thought anything of it. until she started complaining about things, i'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when i had been pregnant. 

i didn't jump to the conclusion, but i did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

they'd been having sex. god knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. i won't go in to details. because i never wanted to imagine them myself. 

we had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. my boyfriend was fuming after i told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

they knew as much as we did of the whole thing. they were as shocked as we were. we've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

but she keeps saying she wants a baby. and i just don't fucking know what to do. i tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  i was trying to be level headed. but she didn't seem to understand at all. we've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

what can i do? is the boy, or his parents liable? what can a doctor do? can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?

"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything? original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

hello everyone, i said that i'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response i got yesterday. in many ways, i was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but i found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200b;

i spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. he basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. we had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning i went back to the flat and confronted her. she was there (neither i nor her work on saturdays), and i set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner i could.

&#x200b;

 basically, i said that i didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. the wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. she basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". look, i'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. i basically said that over the weekend i'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (i'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but i stood my ground and didn't change my course. not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200b;

i left, and there is nothing much more to say really. as i type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). i'll be grand, being totally frank i feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  the coming days i'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".

he said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

i find this logic very sexist and full of double standard. i'm super pissed and not sure how to handle it.

"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house? so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"(az) our neighbors dog was poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. i say absolutely not. how should we proceed? i guess some background is in order here. earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. we were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. the next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. they did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. the next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. this all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

so they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. we tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

so we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. we have yet to contact the lawyer. 

we had made the initial report to animal control last thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" i was really taken aback and i think i asked ""i think so, do you need some?"" 

he then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. i literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. i explained that i actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and i really have no way of knowing which dog is which). he said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" i got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


the officer then asked if he could take everything. i said i wasn't comfortable with that but i would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. i did exactly this. i was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. again i was taken completely aback and said that i'm not sure what he'd be looking for. he told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. it took me as second but i asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. i asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if i remember) ""not yet."" 
i asked him if i could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. i said i would really rather not but i would get back in touch with him. he gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

i just got home and told my wife. my wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. we have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but i feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

she thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. i say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. i'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. wife thinks we should let them, i say absolutely not.

"girlfriend (20f) and her friend (20f) 'tested' to see if i (20m) i would cheat. errr i really don't know how to feel. though i'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. my gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so i did. she wasn't there yet, but her friend was. we chatted for a while and she started being playful, but i brushed it off. playful turned into flirting and i felt super awkward. before i got up she kissed me and i left right after that and called my gf. i explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. i couldn't believe it tbh, i thought she was joking at first. first she was mad that i 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much i could do. and i don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? i've never heard of someone setting up their so and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

where do i go from here. she has apologized (half-assed that is) but i kinda don't want to speak to her right now. we're together for 6 months.",8
"should i (23f) tell my boyfriend (26m) about the egg? pretty short and sweet. together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. he admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. this guy's pretty good! up until then i hadn't seen any. but i just spotted the giant one. i really didn't mean to, i haven't been trying to look for them. 

should i tell him so he can re-hide it? or do i take it tomorrow?

edit: i forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because i was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

edit update: he came to the room and i said ""what if i told you i found the giant egg?"". he laughed and told me ""well, i got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" i jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help i will."" 

i am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! will update then :)

mini update: doing my morning routine. so left for church with his family while i get ready to go and clean a gentleman's house and answer some of the reddit comments! one of the eggs was in my coffee pot. i guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! i'm so touched, honestly. it kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! will be back later once we're both home and i can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

update: firstly, a couple people i think asked so here are the eggs in question(http://imgur.com/a/lw1xoy3). the reese's thing is more of a basket, but i won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. on the shelf i could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's reese's for me in the ""egg"" xd. if you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; i took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) and ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. as for the last one, both of us swear i found it, but i must have dropped it somewhere? under the couch or something. idk. in the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

for everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. but, i mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way i've got it planned much better."". which isn't much news to me, as i've said we've discussed marriage at length (i even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). all i've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to do it.  i mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so i'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. searching for the eggs was very fun!! i needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg i needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand i was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

and no, i don't think i missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. i think i really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! i'll put slips of paper in each egg i hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things i love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) so, that's all folks. no proposal, but a very happy easter on both ends! thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. and to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; i've been there too. if you go through my posting history you'll actually find that so and i went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. it took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

tldr; boyfriend hid eggs. i found eggs. reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their so, easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",8

"update: my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... i got custody!!! **edit: per the bots request, i am required to tell you that i live in washington (wa)**

here's my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

so after one of the most stressful months of my life, i can happily tell you all that i got custody of my step sister.

i did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people i've ever met in my life. i told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

after my step sisters bio dad was informed that i would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. the lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. she said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

after her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, i then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. i've never signed so many things in my entire life. because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, i was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

yesterday, i signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that i had 100% custody of my step sister. after i signed, we both cried and cried for hours. we're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. as i write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

the past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. i consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision i've ever made. these events have made me realise that family isn't just dna based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. i owe all of you for the rest of your lives. once i turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

i hope you all lead wonderful lives. give your loved ones a big hug for me.",2
"while talking dirty to my gf throwaway for obvious reasons.

so a little background: my current gf and i have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. before her i was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and i'm learning everything for the first time. long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. i said i was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside i knew that i had no idea what i would be doing and would kind of be winging it. last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. so we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. she's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
she kind of rambled for a bit, and i was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. the rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than i normally do. this is all new territory for me, but i'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like christopher columbus, and she's what i think is india. so i decide to talk dirty. her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, i figure this is the perfect time to strike. and that's when i cleverly decided to ask if i make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

her face fell. it's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. i went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. i've been wondering how i could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. we approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. i don't think i'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. 

tldr: i decided to be sexy and asked my gf if i made her moister than an oyster. she doesn't think oysters are sexy.",4

"by being accidentally racist so this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



recently ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so i thought i'd go along. 

so anyway here i am about to play my first game of chess ever. i sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (i should now mention my opponent was african american). the chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

i think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

so i grab a pawn and slide it forward, then i look up expecting my opponent to make his move. instead i'm met with a look of confusion and horror, i begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

i then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" i murmur. 
the teacher nods. 

now everyone thinks i'm a massive racist.

"girlfriend (22f) mad about my (24m) answer to scenario, what do i do? so girlfriend and i had just finished having sex. we were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, i was dozing off and then she randomly said ""your love for me is unconditional right?"" and i mean i say that all the time so i didn't think much of it and i said ""yes, i will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers"" and it was clearly a joke. she kisses me but then says "" so if i turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?"" .... i was confused because it was such a random question and i laughed and just said ""i don't know about that, i'd love you as a pet i guess""

she sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point i'm completely lost. i just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" i said ""i mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey i would still love you unconditionally and i would not treat you like 'a pet'"" .... i had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. i just said "" if you were a donkey how else was i supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? am i supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??"" she says ""i'm not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!"" ... i just stopped talking because i didn't want to say anything else wrong. 

i'm just confused. she was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. what did i say? i have no idea what exactly she was upset about. am i not looking into this deep enough? i'm genuinely confused as to what i did and how to fix it. i don't want to say something and make it worse.

"my f28 mil won't take my kid's 4 anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously **update at bottom of post.**

i'll try to keep this as short as possible. sorry for mobile formatting. i've never really seen eye-to-eye with my mil because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... i understand that children need discipline, but i prefer a gentler approach with my son. i've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists i let it go, so i've tried to. 

until now. my son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. she insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that i'm just babying him. i've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

she has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. i told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying i accused her of being an unfit grandmother. which i admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

now my husband wants me to apologise to her. he says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that i'm overreacting. i kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is of the essence because it happens so quickly. 

so, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

she's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a lot of peanuts, everywhere. i asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

i'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a mama's boy who thinks mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. he says he turned out just fine being raised by her and i worry too much. 

would it be awful if i insist she only see him if i'm present? am i completely unreasonable and overreacting? is there anything else i can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**edit/mini-update**: first of all, woah. i did not expect this to get so much attention. thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. in case you missed it: i've left for now, removed my son from the situation, and i'm now currently staying at my brother's house. at least for a few days until things cool off and i'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. in the mean time, i've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. my husband has been to the same appointments i have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

some people have accused me of being a helicopter mom, or trying to demonize my mil. and given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe i'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then i'm okay. i'm not even a sahm, we have an incredible nanny while i work ft, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. in the past, i've tried my best for my mil to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, i've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. but i'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

lastly, i just want to say my mil has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. she won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. so, i don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. she's very strong in her beliefs. i did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. my husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so i told him to find time or he won't be getting any time with my son until he does. if he's going to be so careless, i'll end up dealing with this legally. 

thanks again everyone. words can't express my gratitude. i will update with a new thread eventually.",8

i've spoken to several attorneys and law firms throughout the state and have settled on one and signed the papers and all that stuff today. i want to thank all of you for giving me advice on what to ask and look for when speaking to them all, it really helped in narrowing it down and figuring out who was the best to go with. i can't really give out a whole lot of information because we are just starting to gather all the pieces and put it all together. there most likely will not be any updates to this for quite some time.

to answer the endless messages i received about race, i am white and early 20's, the person i was misidentified as is also white but in his 30's.

i spoke to my boss and hr and will be back at work very soon and 2 months pay advance that will be paid back with ot. also my landlord was really nice and is letting me pay the back rent over the next few months in installments.

"my wife (f30) told me that she cheated on me (m28) and i honestly don't know what to do we have been married for over 5 and a half years. i love her so much. we finally got our own place on december 2018 and things were looking up for us. these 5 years were so magical and i always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that i would marry her again.

this past tuesday, my lead told us that we can vto  (volunteer time off. i work night shift) so my co worker gave me a ride home. (my wife and i share a car). when he dropped me off, i noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. i thought that she parked somewhere else.

as soon as i went inside, i went to our bedroom so that i can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that i am home. the plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

she wasn't in the room. she wasn't home. so i called her and asked her where she was. when she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

my heart broke because i had a feeling of what was going on. she made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. i gave her the benefit of the doubt.

so i was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. she sat on the bed and i asked her if she was okay. she wouldn't answer and began to cry. then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. she said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

i am sad. i honestly thought this would never happen to me. i don't know what to do. we had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. we agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, i am strongly considering in divorcing her. i can't even look at her anymore. the thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. she wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

what should i do? am i overreacting?  i honestly thought of killing myself. i am so sad. she was my everything.

tldr;   wife confessed to cheating. i am so sad. thinking of killing myself.  what do i do?

thank you

&#x200b;

edit to say: just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) i am so surprised for the support! <3

thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. i still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me,  i forgive her. time will heal this pain and honestly, i love her too much to end this.  we have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. i honestly can't imagine being with another person.  she is truly sorry that she cheated on me. most wont agree with this, but i will give her another chance and see where this goes.

and no, i wont kill myself. i promise.  i really appreciate your concerns and replies. it makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. take care everyone and i'll update as time goes on.. <3

\*\*\*update 09/13:\*\*\*

i have been reading the comments. i understand that to most it is stupid that i am still with her. i understand. trust me. we have been talking a lot. she is truly sorry and i forgive her. i put her mistake behind me and i am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  we plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. the reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (we will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

&#x200b;

we are working this out. we are still living together. we are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. honestly, it has been going well. things are looking up because soon, i will be transferring to day shift so that i can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that i have been longing for. i still want her in my life and i don't see divorce. we will work this out.

again, thank you all for helping me in my time of need. i am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. it helps. ill update as time goes on. <3",8

"neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the two spaces in front of our home. after asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving all their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home. california here, getting that out of the way. and full disclosure, its not my home. the home belongs to my parents, but i house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus i love my parents and want what's best for them). i will just be saying my home or my driveway so i dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


these neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with all the memories. i thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

my parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. he has it parked in the middle so that it takes up all the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. it has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. why? i don't know. perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. all i know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

i want to also mention they have a full garage. they also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. and a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

i politely asked him to move his car when i saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. he followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. several days later i visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

i spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since i had asked him to move his car as payback. they said he's really mean and to just let it go. this did not sit right to me, so i later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. i explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

bad idea. i assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. i assumed mom would just tell 'billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. turns out he got it from mom and dad. i get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how i did not just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

i didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. my mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an fu to my mom and dad. that's also when their car got keyed

so since i made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. now the parents are retaliating too.they finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. the one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. the beater was moved so its parked on the other side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. sorry for the run-on sentence. did that all make sense? i hope so.

this has been going on for a few weeks now.

is there anything that can be done? my parent's just seem to want to let it go. not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. my parents travel a lot and my work makes it so i cant always be there to sit the house for them. they fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. i used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


tldr - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. the neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. parents fear retaliation.",2

"by trusting some rando on airbnb shit river 2k19

we have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with our dear friend paul from august 3rd to august 4th, 2019. let me spin you a tale...a tale of shit river.

4:30 pm

our initial impressions of the house were terrific! our illustrious host, paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. paul was friendly! check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. everything was looking great!

6:00 pm

we return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. we fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. we had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! a few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.

8:15 pm

after a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. we discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). plunging half successfully, we messaged paul and let him know the situation. only one working toilet isn't ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we'd make it work!

8:38 pm

the remaining toilet won't flush. the party grows worried. paul assures us that he will call a plumber.

9:00 pm

paul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won't be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. a five second google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in virginia beach, but paul did not want to call them. after ""informing"" our dear friend paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. a plumber was found! magic!

9:30 pm

raw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. the house likely possessed. drinks have been drunk like it's the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or uber to safety. after all, where would we go? we pray to whatever eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.

10:01 pm

the stench. dear god. the stench.

11:20 pm

emergency plumber arrives with paul and paul's friend in tow. one of them goes to the roof. one of them pounds a pabst blue ribbon. advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. we split the party.

12:20 am

plumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for ""the final blasting."" paul's friend fails to discover how to ""switch off his nose"" and taps out (""i'm out man, i'm out.""). it's been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. the backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *for now.*

12:22 am

paul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. classic paul! we oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.

12:24 am

the final blasting. the stench. the horror. the splatter. we all take 2d6 damage.

1:00 am

paul & co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. he requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. we decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. we also decide to leave the next morning.

2:00 am: the witching hour

lights flicker ominously. the house isn't finished with us yet…

4:30 am

paul offers a full refund (excellent). he later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). we ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. he offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).

10:30 am

the party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. we take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the toilet gods.

11:10 am

we commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. after completion, we agree never to speak of this again. who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?

11:11 am

the great gurgle. we hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. was it the broken spirit of paul's friend chugging another pbr? nope. the shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.

11:15 am

we hasten our efforts to flee. paul is called. we finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.

11:30 am

we convene to discuss departure. suddenly, one of our party realizes we've been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping shit river pooling in the hallway. fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the rubicon. we form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.

11:32 am

water oozes up from the baseboards. satan's septic tank thirsts for blood. the lights flicker once more.

11: 35 am

our dearest friend paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: ""this house is fucked."" agreeing with paul's uncanny observation, we flee the house. the smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.

tl;dr i trusted my airbnb to have functional plumbing but instead it exploded.",4

"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

tl;dr: my friends are acting like i was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",8
"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson? necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

tldr for the 1st post: last monday, soon after i left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200b;

update: on tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. my wife and i interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. after that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

an hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and i to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. the detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

from there we went home.

that afternoon, neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. i opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. soon after i went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. when i got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

for the most part, wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. we did not see neighbor all day. wednesday night, we came to know why. a detective called to let us know neighbor had been taken into custody on tuesday night (while i was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (i assume arraignment).

thursday morning a woman from the state dcf/cp&p office came to the house. she made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & i together. to my mind, this was actually a good thing.  she was able to let us know that neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (i don't recall exactly what they are). she also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in california.

2 – neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on tuesday evening.

from there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. we will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

while she was there i asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if neighbor was likely to be free again soon. she was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. she informed us that neighbor's hearing was set for monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. she wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have neighbor remain in custody.

here's the thing. neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. i advised the detective that we were ok with neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. she confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. we agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom neighbor lives should have input.

that brings us up to date and, to be honest, i am torn. i hate what this man did. i hate that it has happened before, and i never want it to happen again. with that said, at first i was unsure as to whether or not neighbor even knew what he did. he clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. but he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. as he admitted the act to the arresting detective. i get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute lennie from of mice & men, and that tears my heart out. i don't think he really understands, and i don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. at the same time, he touched my son. if there were no clear impairment, i would want to take a baseball bat to his head. but there is, and instead i just feel like shit for everyone involved. this sucks, full stop.

on a more selfish note, the megan's law registry. there are a handful of homes for sale in the area. until now, my wife and i were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. that hope is now over. because neighbor's history all predates mega's law, he was not on the registry. now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. i realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. to repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

sorry for the book, and if the mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, i understand. honestly, i just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving? when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

"tifu by having a threesome my girlfriend and i have been together for several months now. we only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend i fucked up. 

her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. they were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and i was involved. we went to the bed and started fucking, but before i went inside her friend, i looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

she said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. after a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

my girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so i thought. i called her the following night cause i felt extremely guilty. she said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. she simply asked that i never do it again. 

come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. i absolutely love her so much but i let lust get between us. 

i really fucked up guys..

tl;dr: i fucked my girlfriend's friend with her and then she broke up with me because she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends.",4

"a good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. now his adult son is suing me (virginia). so basically, i lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. he was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. we watched football together, drank together, and all that. i even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. the point, i guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. i think this point is important.




he recently passed, which sucks. then i learned he left me a little something. that little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since i had no idea he had that kind of money. that 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. so it's not like i'm getting the majority of his estate. but then his son, who i'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  i ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




i have three things going for me:




1. my friend was mentally acute. he had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. our town's not big, and i know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. hell, i even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. these people can be witnesses i think, though i don't know how civil suits work.


3. his adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. she came around from time to time, and knew her dad and i hung out and stuff. the first time i met her, her dad and i were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the south so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





basically, my point is he and i were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? also, what kind of lawyer should i hire? the lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but i don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





edit: you guys were right. the son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. the letter had a bunch of legal terms, so i didn't get the gist when i first read it. i'll be contacting a lawyer asap.",2
"update: i am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. i got found out. i post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

since that time i got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until i landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

recently i found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what i used to do, and pays more. basically tired of doing nothing even though im getting paid for it.  

the day after i mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office i got a phone call exactly at 8 am. the head of hr for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. i asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. she stated that there were no issues like that. they just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

i told her that they should have that information as head of hr and promptly disconnected stating i had to return back to work. she called back at 12:05 exactly. 

i have been ducking her calls ever since. her voicemails state that i am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. my emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. each time i am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. she calls at least once per day. 

i am thinking i just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

how incredibly bad is that plan? before anyone says it. i know... i know ok i should have quit a long time ago. i did not.

"a male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. he just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists. spa is in maryland. a friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. he is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. he has not spoken with management yet. he just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

minor update: i advised him of his many options after reading the comments. he went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

i'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. the mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room.

"update: i just recieved a demand letter from enterprise rent-a-car stating that if i do not return their rental car, i will be charged with embezzlement and grand theft auto. i never rented a car from them. (san jose, california) thank you to everyone for the advice. i'm also a she by the way (many of you thought i was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

after my initial post, i saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because enterprise is the one at fault and i shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. so i did exactly this, and she told me that id i want her to give me more info, i would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that i am not the person who rented the car.  if not, she would report me for embezzlement and grand theft to the sacramento police. upon hearing this, i decided to file a report immediately online with the san jose police department. i know many of you said i shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, i did not want to take any chances where i could end up with a warrant on my head.  i thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  after filing it, i emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  when i spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that i was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

on may 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. she showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had my information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with cash. (i thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) the manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the sacramento police later that afternoon. the following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as fraud, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  at this point, i was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. i then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to sacramento see who the hell this woman is. however, turns out i didn't have to because 2 hours later...  
  
  
  
the san jose police did show up knocking on my front door. ( 2 policemen and 2 chp officers) before opening it, the first thing i did was grab the copy of the police report i printed because i seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). when i open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if name of woman i do not know lives at my home? i tell them no, and that i have no idea who that is,  then they ask if i am alymg and i tell them that i am. they then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of fremont that morning. the accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. they then show the license to me and it's an exact replica of my drivers license, and i ask them how this is possible if i have my license in my wallet? they then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (the black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) i then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when i hand them my report. i explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from enterprise.  so basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. i told the officers that i have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. i then asked them who is the name of the woman i do not know and they told me that she is the who stole the car. however, i'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we do not look a-like at all. idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. but after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

i do have her name now though, and after doing a google search i found her facebook and other social media accounts. i'm very tempted to message her but i've decided to leave this to the police because i have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she does know where i live) however, i do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

"it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce. happy update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy\_update\_it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/)  


title may seem harsh so i apologize. also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

bit of background info about my wife: she's an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. so to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

to make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. for the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch netflix in bed. i brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least i could do.

but now it's 7 months later and she's still crying and watching netflix in bed all day. i ask her every day if she needs anything but all i get in response is variations on either ""leave me alone"" or ""some peace and quiet"". virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. i do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. i've suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. therapy. she said that all therapists spew bs back at you.
2. adoption or using a surrogate. she shot down both saying that it just didn't feel right to her.
3. moving to her parents' city. she said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). she snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. again, she said that's too much stress.

earlier tonight i had a talk with my wife. i told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. she said that she's fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

don't get me wrong, i love my wife with all my heart. i'm doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. i know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly i cannot bear living like this for much longer. what do (or can) i do?",8
"microwaving leftovers or a frozen meal? turn the power down and the timer up. 10mins at half power does a better job than 3 minutes on full throttle. food comes out looking like food!!! seriously, microwaves only do a shit job if you're impatient. dial the power back, cook it for longer, and go choose your show on netflix or whatevs while it cooks - you know you're just gonna let it go cold while you choose a show anyway, so get on top of your shit, flip it and reverse it, choose the show first and enjoy your hot leftovers rather than choking down a cold soggy mess.

for example: a lean cuisine green curry & rice says on the box ""cook on high for 3 minutes let stand and serve"" - but it only says that because they know you're an impatient little shit and won't buy the box that says ""cook on 1/4 power for 12 minutes"" because if you're not going to cook your own calorie controlled curry, you're also not going to stand around waiting *twelve whole minutes* for this one when the *other* brand says it's done in three.


edit because you people never stop posting the same 'such time yuck microwave 20 mins in oven instead am smart' comment a million times over:

i'm a chef. you all have high hopes for how quickly your oven pre heats, and how easily you can remove a frozen meal from plastic tupperware to change into an oven safe dish. you all also seem to be the type of person who would blast their shit in the microwave anyway, because s frozen curry being cooked through in the oven in 20 mins from turning the oven on would mean using a blast furnace. also, did the title say ""if you're choosing how to reheat something...?"" no. it doesn't. because i'm specifically addressing **microwave** usage, so outta here with your faux superiority, go make your own thread about ovens and toaster ovens and airfryers. not everyone has those things - dorm students may have a cooktop and convection microwave. i certainly don't have space for a toaster oven to sit around on my bench like a jerk all day (that's what the microwave is for).

 however the last few days he got increasingly agitated and kept asking me if i was lying, if he's too small, and wouldn't take ""you're fine"" or ""you're average"" or ""i don't care how big it is"" for an answer. i told him to stop pestering me but this went on for a few more days until i snapped and told him he's below average but he has nothing to worry about. obviously he didn't take it well.

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

"by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years. this did happen today. my grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. she doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. one of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. she says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. so she keeps changing the position of my bed when i am away for work. when i come back, i reposition it my way so that i don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
today, she was repositioning the room while i was there which annoyed me. so i took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that i was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. infact i was pointing east . i instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. and she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. i pointed it out to her. i thought she would take it lightly. oh man i was wrong. i fucked up biig time. she lost herself. she started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. i am looking at her old compass right now and i can say it doesn't seem right at all. i think i will have to fix this issue today itself. she is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. how stupid am i.

edit 2: please stop giving me awards this is a throwaway account. spend your money on people who make dank memes

the title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

my fiance and i are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, summer 2021.

i make pretty good money for my age. in fact, i make more money than any of my friends or family, and i would bet i'm in the ""1%"" of my community. i try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. i should also add when we started dating, i was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

my fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. she was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  since then, she hasn't worked. i really didn't mind at all. i make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

i am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead i just would venmo her some cash weekly. it was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

she has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. i know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  she has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

i shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

i told her i would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so i could see exactly what she was spending it on. i could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but i hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

she blew up. telling me i wasn't trusting her and how i was the one against joint bank accounts so i should understand her privacy. yeah, huge red flags all over the place.

i talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying i was not respecting her privacy when i'm the one that demands it also.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

but she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. i'm not sure how i should proceed.

if you talk to somebody and they don't express themselves as nicely as you do, be the bigger person and let them talk and try and make their point. your argument should rest only on the content and not on the delivery. and if you find that you can't win arguments if you don't use the trick of being super eloquent, maybe take it as an opportunity to learn and don't see it as defeat.",6
"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

edit: clarifying the tl;dr

edit 2, electric boogaloo: why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. also thanks for the silver

edit 3, freud enters the chat: since like half of the comments are ""why would you cry from seeing your dad's dick"":

* we are all americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us
* we are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents
* it wasn't crying like oh my god what will i do, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like ""i can't believe this is what just happened""

edit 4, the (provable) finale: i'm not posting a picture of this man's penis you nasties",4
"if you make a mistake, admit to the mistake, apologize, and explain what steps you'll take to prevent it from happening again in the future. it's very hard for people to yell at you if you've done that. both professionally and in my personal life, i know a bunch of people that refuse to admit to having made a mistake. when i mess up (and we all do at some point,) i just own up to it right away. by accepting responsibility, apologizing, and saying what i'll do to keep it from happening again, i not only avoid getting a lecture about whatever i did wrong, i also get thanked by my boss/friend/whoever.",9
