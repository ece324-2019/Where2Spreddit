South Park is vasty more intellectual than Rick and Morty.,"Rick and Morty is funny, and a good show. Sure. But this underlying thought that it is somehow for intellectuals is absurd. I thought at first it was just a meme, something that would die off, but people still, and seriously, believe it is some how transcendent of the writing.

South Park in the other hand is topical, witty, often delving into serious topics in a way that is so absurd and humorous that you don't notice how good the points they are making are until you think about it later. Through crude antics and exaggerated perspectives they actually manage to say something substantial. Not only that, but often they show just how absurd something is bringing an almost absolute clarity to the issue they are covering and thus it is hard to argue against it using what you may have thought before was a solid point. And they do it in a way anyone can understand and digest.",unpopularopinion
"""My body my choice"" isn't a good argument against pro-life people","Gonna start this off by immediately saying I am pro choice, and not going to get into debates about that here. I just want to say people who keep repeating the lines ""it is my body"" and ""it is my choice"" aren't going to sway any pro-life people to come to your side.

Pro-life people believe that a fetus is alive, and aborting it is akin to murder, they don't see a difference between aborting a 2 month old fetus and killing a just born baby. So repeating the same lines at them over and over again with the assumption they agree a fetus isn't its own being with its own rights is just going to piss them off.

Neither of us are gay or have interest in a relationship between us. We talked, he isn't gay.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvftkn/my_best_friend_20m_at_the_time_broke_off_our/)

I wanna start by thanking users u/maedocc and u/lalee_pop and everyone else for their advice in the comments. They, along with some advice from a 3rd person gave me the encouragement and strength to finally after 2 years reach back out to my best friend at the time. Last Friday night I drove back to visit my parents, and had noticed that my old friend was also back in town for the weekend. That was when I created my original post asking for advice, because something was telling me that was the time to reach out but I didn't know how. 

I decided to look through a folder of screenshots of stuff we had sent each other years ago, found a funny picture that he had drawn, and decided I would send that. I sent it, and said something like ""wow even 2 years later you were able to tell the future"". I waited, not knowing how he'd respond. Eventually he did, and just gave a normal response. So I asked if a mutual friend's house was still the get together spot on Saturday's, and he said yeah. He asked me if I was going to go, and I said probably. He responded with ""Cool! I'll be there"".

That was the first time in 2 years that we talked for more than a sentence, and he seemed excited to hang out again. I was elated, I got so pumped up. We hung out all Saturday and it was like the last 2 years didn't even happen. We didn't lose any chemistry, and we threw old inside jokes back and forth at each other like it was the old times. He then asked if I wanted to hang out Sunday too! We hung out all Sunday, and things started to feel like it was normal. 

Then throughout this whole week while I was back in my normal city, with work, he initiated a lot of texting/snapchatting. That, to me, felt like that was the last step to things being normal. Because it showed he wanted to talk to. Eventually we both said that we had wanted to reach out earlier but were too stupid/awkward/anxious to reach out. So that gave us a little chuckle. So we basically wasted 2 years because we both were afraid to reach out. Now we have been talking pretty much 24/7 all week, and it makes me so happy knowing I have my best friend/brother back in my life. It honestly feels like I'm a different person with him being around. Thanks for all the advice!

**TL;DR - Reached out to friend after 2 years of silence, ends up reconnecting incredibly easy while learning that we both wanted to reach out but never did out of idiocy and now things are back to normal.**",relationship_advice

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

"My babies and I escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3AM last night... I'm scared, my kids are confused... I don't even know how I feel right now but nothing seems real.","[UPDATE]
Just received a call from the police in our town. It was a weird area code so I almost didn't answer. He said he was with our police department and that my kids dad called them. I told him we were at a domestic violence shelter and he said he read the report and wasn't calling to get info for him but to make sure me and the kids are okay. I told him about the non step messages and phone calls and he said to make sure my advocate sees all the messages and to write it down and that if he keeps harassing me to call him back even before the protective order is officially filed. Sounds like they are on my side too. Thank god. 
[END UPDATE]

My children's dad and I have been together for about 4 and a half years. The insults, emotional abuse and mental instability were apparent from literally day one but I think I was so broken and damaged back then I was just happy not to go to bed alone.  The physical violence started within a couple of weeks. I still remember crying on my way to work within the first month of us dating asking myself ""Why are you in this? Why are you allowing this to happen to you?"" after he drug me by the hair the night before through the apartment to the bathroom after I didn't clean it to his standards. 

When I finally told myself I would rather be lonely than treated this way and was prepared to leave I found out I was pregnant and everything changed. I was always told I couldn't have kids so this was my miracle and I wanted to see if I could make this family work. I spent almost the whole pregnancy in the hospital with HG and cardiac problems wracking up medical bills and losing everything including my car since I couldn't work. By the time my son got here though none of it mattered... he was my world and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. On the way home from the hospital my ex's sister asked me if he had ever been abusive to me and it caught me off guard... I just said no and stared ahead as she told me of his history. Another dumb move on my part just hoping I could make it work. 

Almost every day there was some type of conflict... any inner turmoil or demons he faced would turn into him trying to take anyone around him down with him. My name basically became ""cunt"" and the bruises faded and new ones came and faded again. 

I became pregnant with our second child and nothing changed still. I still have the photos from when he punched me in the face and busted my upper and lower lips open when I accidentally burnt his pizza. 
Our baby girl arrived and once again was the most precious gift to me but things continued to take darker twists with every unstable mood he would come home in.  His favorite thing to do was tell our toddler son to ""get a knife and stab mommy""

Last night was the end though. I have been saving to leave and was hoping to be able to be out by summer. The day started with him angry about nothing and coming home from work telling me I'm a worthless piece of shit. He left to go to a bar and came back around 11pm so drunk he could barely put words together but was still able to throw soda cans, objects and food at my head, start yelling the ""n"" word over and over again and call me every name in the book through his drunken slurring. After he threw something else and tagged me in the face I finally called the police and before they got there he took off. I filed a report and locked all the doors. 

He started texting me saying some of the most psychotic things like ""I hear you beating the kids, stop beating the kids, why are you doing this. Let me in, stop beating he kids"", so I had to take pictures all over the outside and inside of the house to make sure I have time stamped proof he was out of his mind. 

I called an emergency domestic violence shelter I was referred to and they said they would get us in at 7 am but before I could even get done packing he busted down the deadbolted door so I threatened to call the police again, picked up the kids and ran. We got to the police station where the shelter volunteers got us safely to the shelter. I have never felt so much relief in my life but so much anxiety of what is to come. 

He has been texting me all day going between threatening messages and apologies. Saying he would rather the kids end up in foster care than with me and that he will make false CPS reports against me. 

The shelter is helping me get a protective order and build cases against him for both victims compensations, CPS, and custody and are helping with counseling and legal aid. 

It's so strange to say it's over... there is so much ahead but I'm free. My kids are free....

AITA for feeding my sons vegan friend meat?,"Hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, I'm not one to really do this but I'm genuinely wondering if I'm in the wrong.


So my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


I don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


Well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


Well, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


Well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no. So what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children,"Saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.

I've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn't confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?

Edit- okay I get it I'm an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn't think the triplets had different fathers. I'm not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",AmItheAsshole

Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200B;

Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200B;

I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up.

A 'dislike' button on Facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better,"The title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but I do believe this to be true. The absence of a dislike button on Facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and I believe it also influences peoples own opinions.

This tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. Add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


It would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, I think it is IMPORTANT.  


Yes I know its a social media site, but we have to take it seriously now. It influences people, some people live on there. Facebook impacts the world.

TIFU by cleaning my ass with a comb.,"This happened all of 45 minutes ago, and yes, it still hurts a bit.

To start, some context. I always take incredibly long showers due to me getting sidetracked by random things, such as spinning in circles in order to get an even distribution of hot water, trying to scratch that damn itch, and the fascination that is my penis.

Another thing to note is that I always take a comb with me to the shower as I find it helps ""rub in"" the shampoo, except this time, there was a new [comb](https://i.imgur.com/MdY4S21.jpg) that I hadn't seen before. 

Now that that is out of the way, let's get into the Fuck-Up. My shower started off as usual, rubbing a bar of soap absolutely everywhere while trying to use my fingernails to carve designs into the bar. After about five or so minutes of soaping, I moved to the hair process, which also went as planned. This is where I dun goofed. Upon seeing this new comb, I decided to use it, as it had finer teeth. After using said comb, I realised that it also had a ^^much sharper/thinner handle. 

>The following actions have been made by a fucking idiot, and is NSFW. Proceed with caution.

When I saw the handle, for some unknown reason, I built the thought process of ""This handle is so thin, I bed I'd be able to stick it up my ass and not feel it."" Was it sensible? No. Was there reasoning behind it? Nada. Was it a good idea? Absolutely not.

That thought was immediately followed up with ""Why the hell not,"" which was then followed by a comb, of which I had never seen before, going into my ass. Now obviously, with nothing ever being in my ass before, there was a small brown patch on the end of the handle upon removal, and for some reason, I got the god awful idea that I should clean the inside of my ass. How, you ask? Stab the handle into a bar of fucking soap, of course. 

With the handle now soapy, I returned to my ass and was immediatly greeted with a slight stinging feeling. ""Whatever, thats probably the soap cleaning away and is bound to only be temporary,"" I thought. I. Was. Wrong. The stinging only got worse once I pulled the comb out. I then spent the rest of my shower rubbing my ass in hopes to get rid of the feeling.

Fast forward to nearly an hour later and I am still feeling the consequenses of putting a hair product in my arse.

Over all, 1/10, would not penetrate again.

>TLDR: I stuck a soapy comb handle up my ass in hopes to clean it. Not a good idea.

>Edit: Too many people are reading about me using a comb to sodomize myself, go away!!

>Edit #2: My ass feels fine now. I've eaten a massive cheeseburger, however, so the visit to the bathroom later should be interesting.

>Edit #3: A lot of you seem to be concerned as to where the comb came from/whos it is, which is so be expected since I forgot to specify that I had bought it a few months ago and only today found it again. No, thankfully, it was no one else's hair product that became my booty stabber. 

>Edit #4: #Alright, who did it? Who guilded the booty stabber?

>Edit #5: It was the soap causing the pain (the pain lasted less than 90 minutes), not the comb. The *buttfuck retarded comb abuser lives to shit another day!

>**Also, the comb was mine, don't worry. I had bought it a few months ago because of the finer teeth and had forgotten about it until now.

>Edit #6: Yes, I have ADHD, and yes, it is treated. I am a happy, yet easily distracted curious Charlie!",tifu
TIFU by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans," About three weeks ago, I began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who I'll call ""Ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

We live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. He's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. I thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt I get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. They are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

I ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. I used his email on the sign-up so that I could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

One small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. I sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which I mean I entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. I simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. I know how to do this because I'm a brilliant hacker (I googled it).

While carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING. I immediately noped off his computer, and of course I didn't open the email, but the damage is done. Secret's out!

My heart fell right through my butt, you guys. I actually died and now I'm a ghost writing this.

I probably should have pretended I never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but I was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. Within the hour I broke down and called Ray to sheepishly confess what I had done. He wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that I spoiled the surprise. 

Here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

My punishment for snooping is that the suspense is KILLING ME. I've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. Every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

A romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, I thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""Why would you think that I'm going to propose to you?"" He said. ""That sounds like something you wouldn't know about because I'd keep it secret IN MY PERSONAL EMAIL!""

Now he's started intermittently faking me out. The other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. He keeps getting down on one knee... Looking up at me... And saying, ""Gotta tie this shoe!"" The emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is MADDENING. Every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

One more thing: I somehow fucked up the email settings. The shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. So that surprise got spoiled, too. Turns out I'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

I guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and I do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

If we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

"I(F32) just found out that my husband(M36) has a full blown secret family because his ""other wive(F29) "" just knocked on my door.","Sorry if this sounds so vague and incomplete. I am confused and my eyes are all swollen up

I thought that I had a pretty happy marriage with ""Jonas"". We have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. We have twins (f8).

Jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. During this time he will visit us and we will visit him. It is I convinient but he earns really good. So good so that I needn't work if I didn't want to.

During all those years I have never suspected him if cheating. He was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

So this comes all of the blue for me. Jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
A woman knocked on my door. She introduces herself as ""cherry"". When I asked her what it was about she broke down crying. I took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about Jonas. Apparently she and Jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

We were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. He has 2 different sets of social media accounts. And as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

At first I was livid and screamed at her. Till I calmed down as she was just a victim.

Apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if I visit) trough some bank statements. She searched his keys and went snooping. There is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

We both cried our eyes out together. Cursed out Jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

She is not legally married to Jonas as he sold her the ""I don't believe in marriage Spiel"". The only legal spouse he has is me. I know I have to divorce him but maybe I just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. Also should I keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

Edit : I guess reddit only takes stories serious if it has happened over and over again.

Thanks for the few helpful advices I have gotten and a serious fuck you to the people making fun of me or calling me a troll. I honestly thought that someone would listen to me here but I guess it's if I wanted that I needed to have better grammar and a less crazy story.

Thanks for the people that did tho. Cherry has left and I will pick up my kids from my sister's right now. I will be leaving the house for a few days to get my ducks in a row and begin legal proceedings",relationship_advice
AITA for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.

Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. 

So AITA?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell,"My wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. Sometime over the weekend I noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. I asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the Paw Patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. It came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. I loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

Fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school Alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. So my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. I pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. My son looks happy so I figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

Our conversation:

Teacher: Ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

Me: Yea! It's cool right? We've been playing with that thing for days. 

Teacher: Uh, Mr. Scott, do you know what that is?

I start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

Teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

I get confused. 

Teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

I'm still confused...

Teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

Me: It just...stays in there? 

She nods. 

Me: are you sure? I don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

Teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

We're both clearly uncomfortable. 

Me: alright then.....so where do I get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


My wife laughed hysterically when we told her. My son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

TL:DR thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and I played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

Edit: WOW!!!! I cannot believe this got so much attention. I'm glad everyone got a good laugh. A bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn't know it was me, though. 

My wife has been reading the comments and insisted that I clarify that I know all about her cycle. We are TTC currently and, just as it was with our son, I know when she's ovulating, I track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. I grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices I was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. I was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like I said, this device helped save a Chickoletta over the weekend. I've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. My wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

I'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",tifu
TIFU by making myself an uncle NSFW,"So this started 2 weeks ago

I went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. Doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a GF.

 Naturally I start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. I get to teasing him about him not losing his V card, my mom is not liking the conversation. His gf ends up coming over, I stopped the teasing I'm not a monster. So I'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. I tell her not to worry about it I'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

I get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. My argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised Ying and yang I grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. He grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. Saying how a party would be good for him I even offered to go, (I'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, I told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (I know how that sounds). So I finally convinced her she agreed.

So I decide that I need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. I knew my bro was losing it that night. Fast forward to the party, I drop him off so my mom thinks Imma be there. I pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. Bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

Skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. Well holy fuck did I get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. Well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  So now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and I'm becoming an uncle.

TL;DR Convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his V card, he got his gf pregnant. 


Update 1: So she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. So we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. I'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. My brother is getting tested for STI's I was all over him about that. Also thanks for the gold and silver (I have no idea what that does). Thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

Update 2: Everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. My brother does not have any STI's or STD's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,I'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. There are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can DM and I can explain what I did if curious, how I got out, how my life has changed and all. 

Update 3: *in Maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! Mother is crying brother is in shock and the GFs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. Everyone pray for this child. 


Update 4: They are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, I helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. I've started a savings account for him, and my GF and I are going to move into a place with him and his GF to help them out.",tifu

My wife (F30) told me that she cheated on me (M28) and I honestly don't know what to do,"We have been married for over 5 and a half years. I love her so much. We finally got our own place on December 2018 and things were looking up for us. These 5 years were so magical and I always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that I would marry her again.

This past Tuesday, my lead told us that we can VTO  (Volunteer Time Off. I work night shift) So my co worker gave me a ride home. (My wife and I share a car). When he dropped me off, I noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. I thought that she parked somewhere else.

As soon as I went inside, I went to our bedroom so that I can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that I am home. The plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

She wasn't in the room. She wasn't home. So I called her and asked her where she was. When she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

My heart broke because I had a feeling of what was going on. She made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. I gave her the benefit of the doubt.

So I was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. She sat on the bed and I asked her if she was okay. She wouldn't answer and began to cry. Then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. She said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

I am sad. I honestly thought this would never happen to me. I don't know what to do. We had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. We agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, I am strongly considering in divorcing her. I can't even look at her anymore. The thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. She wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

What should I do? Am I overreacting?  I honestly thought of killing myself. I am so sad. She was my everything.

TLDR;   Wife confessed to cheating. I am so sad. Thinking of killing myself.  What do I do?

She is truly sorry that she cheated on me. Most wont agree with this, but I will give her another chance and see where this goes.

I have been reading the comments. I understand that to most it is stupid that I am still with her. I understand. Trust me. We have been talking a lot. She is truly sorry and I forgive her. I put her mistake behind me and I am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  We plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. The reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (We will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

We are working this out. We are still living together. We are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. Honestly, it has been going well.

AITA for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?,"This happened a couple weeks ago, but I'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

I travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. Most recently, I was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. This wouldn't be a problem except that I had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket I paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way I had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (Because I take this specific route and airline a lot, I knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since I just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

Of course, when it came time to board, I get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. I politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. Her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before I got there, and would I do her the favor of just switching?

Here's the thing: if circumstances were different, I would have! But I explained that I had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that I could sleep. I really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts RIGHT THEN AND THERE. 

By this point the plane is filling up, I'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so I just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. The mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. The flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as I did) goes, ""This is an exit row. Your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. There's not going to *be* another empty row. Please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

So I sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and I figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, I push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. When we land, I'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""You look like you slept well, bitch.""

So, Reddit. Am I the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**EDITED TO ADD:** Okay, thanks Reddit, I think most of you agree that I'm not the asshole here. But please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. The kids were just fine. They watched something on their iPad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. Kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",AmItheAsshole

"I (33 F) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 M) and I are indian. He thinks I've cheated, I did not.","T/L/D/R

I (33 F) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 M) and I are indian. He thinks I've cheated, meanwhile I'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like I'm drowning.

UPDATE: I'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. I had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

I've decided I'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. I'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me.

So, first, I didn't appreciate all of the nasty messages I got from people insulting me and berating me and saying that I was trying to ruin this family by calling CPS.  Yes, I'm well aware of the fact that some CPS workers have made poor decisions, but you're in idiot to not utilize it when it's appropriate. Along with those messages, I got quite a few from people saying they grew up in similar situations and had been indeed been molested and to please call and to put this in the hands of the authorities.  

I never personally thought that the girl was getting molested; I just wondered at what point this creepy emotional incest is deemed inappropriate. So I went ahead and called and when I said the woman's name, the worker said, ""Oh, she works at *****?"" So, she was already on the radar.  I told her what facts that I knew about that I thought were concerning.

Yesterday the coworker went on a rant about how she's being persecuted, that CPS is on her case again- again, after previous complaints about the child pooping repeatedly in the neighbor's yard when she was a toddler and something else about food stamp fraud getting her checked out by CPS a couple of years ago.  

There was a long convoluted conversation. I have to listen to this self-absorbed narcissist talk about herself endlessly and never say anything, just try to disengage as diplomatically as possible and get back to work.  But CPS wanted to see the girl's bedroom and they said she slept in the attic, which is a pull-down trap door. Which is never actually used and CPS was well aware of that. When the breast feeding topic came up, I was like Oh, she still breast feeds, huh? And get this, she said that at her age, she can no longer ""latch on"" and actually get milk out of the breast anyway. It's for bonding purposes. 

The bed thing......I thought it was super obvious before that they were having sex with her in the bed, which I personally find disgusting, but in the last post people seemed okey-dokey with it. So, I asked her, Isn't it hard to get any privacy for sex? You see, I'm not holistic and could not understand that it's a worldwide practice for parents to have sex in front of their children and it takes away their fear of death. Fucking gross. THREE HOURS LATER and she's still talking about all of this, well, more about how she's a martyr, and her mom brings the kid in after school. I turn to the kid and for the first time, got brave and said to the her, ""So what do you do at night when they're having sex?"" And she said, ""I pretend I'm sleeping!""  Both the grandma and mom were speechless, like maybe it dawned on them a little bit about how very bad that sounds.  

I'm not exactly sure how everything went down, but I do know that she's not being taken out of school, she was assessed and the professionals didn't think she was being molested (again, I didn't really think so but still thought this was inappropriate and not just a different form of parenting). They have to clean out one of the bedrooms that's a hoarding pit and provide her with her own bedroom. The girl's father was somehow in the loop and will be more active with her, since he's technically got half-time custody anyway. 

She said she's trying to have a second baby now anyway. And my favorite part, her sycophantic friends, even more poor than her, are doing fund raising on her behalf; for what or why, I do not know. 

For the people saying that they're going to figure out who I am here on Reddit, first of all, these people brag about not using social media, and second of all, they can kiss my ass; I'm leaving soon for nursing school WHERE I'M GOING TO VACCINATE ALL OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN!

My sister(8F) walked in on me(20M) and my boyfriend(22M) having sex! UPDATE," [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b9owlv/help\_my\_little\_sister8f\_walked\_in\_on\_me20m\_and\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9owlv/help_my_little_sister8f_walked_in_on_me20m_and_my/) \-Original post 

I made dinner and put  Frozen on  to get her to sit with me on the couch. It was so awkward. She still wouldn't look at me.

I finally got her to open up. I apologized to her for having seen what she saw. I asked her what she thinks she saw...... all she asked was why was BF hurting me?. I explained that BF and I were just wrestling and I was upset that I lost. Then she goes to ask why was I screaming then? (I was wishing lightening would strike me). I told her that I was mad cause I was losing. She bought it.. THANK GOD. Poor thing got freaked out because she thought BF was hurting me. I texted him and asked him to call me and apologize to me for 'hurting' me. He did and I put on speaker phone and he apologized. She felt so much better after that. She was back to her self again after that. We finished the movie and I gave her cough syrup and put her to bed. Disaster avoided!

I did call and tell my parents. They were shocked. I haven't come out to them yet and they were unaware that my 'friend' was  actually my BF that I've been seeing for a year. As for the sex part.... before they could yell, I apologized  and promised them it won't happen again. AND I reminded them of the time I came home from school when I was 16 and caught them in the act on the kitchen island.  That got me out of trouble. I wasn't grounded or noting. They did ask if they could meet him sometime next week (he also wants to apologize to them).

Today was a good day. Saved my sister's childhood, came out to my parents, had sex- got caught and didn't get in trouble , and parents want to meet my BF.

Lesson learned. If I want to be intimate with him again, I'll go to his apartment.

TIFU by almost getting my dad in trouble for child porn,"So this happened about 15 years ago when i was around 8 years old. Its a memory that came back to me all of sudden and me realizing how fucked it really was.

My dad had a digital camera that me and my brother used to play with a lot. We took pictures of many different things around the house.

Then an idea popped up in my head. Idk why I thought this was a good idea but I decided to take a picture of my brother's, who is 7 at the time, butthole. Like close up shots of my brother spreading his ass cheeks. Multiple shots, different angles, I was doing a photoshoot on my brother's asshole. We were laughing a lot and having fun with it. 

I left the pictures in the camera and just forgot about it. Few weeks later, my dad didnt look at what was inside the memory card. And went to costco to get the pictures printed. 

The people that handled the photos saw a close up photoshoot of my brother's asshole. There must have been atleast 10 photos from what I remembered. That shit was child pornography.

The good thing was nothing came out of it which is what I am most shocked about. My dad called us in the room to show us what we did. His reaction was ""What the hell is this!"" And ripped it to shreads. That was that. 

15 years later I realized how things could have turned bad for my dad if someone actually tried to do something that day.

Tldr:  took pics of my bros butthole with a camera, my dad ,without knowing ,went to costco to print them, people that work at costco saw a photoshoot of my brothers asshole, dad didnt get in trouble thankfully.

Edit: yes costco actually printed them out. I remember them being in a nice little paper envelope.

Edit 2: I am surprised by how common kids are taking pictures of each other buttholes. Still havent found my name yet in the comments. Maybe i should just ask him about it. We are pretty close but its just really weird to bring up.

Edit 3: Now that I think about what would happen if I told my brother. Its too fking awkward and cringey. ""Hey remember that time i took pictures of your asshole?"" I will set the price at five platinums for me to tell him. Why is it so high? Cause i know yall wont be able to do it.

Edit 4: What the actual fuck! I did the research, I looked at the top of all time of tifu. And all it had was 6 plats at most. It happened in less than 5 mins. Oh god. Im in class right now. Ill update tonight. Fuck me.

Edit 5: TLDR at the bottom. 

8 platinums is 8 platinums. During the whole class period I couldnt focus in class at all, because I was thinking of what would happen. These are the type of memories that stay in the back of your mind never to be mentioned ever again. 

As I was driving home, I thought how the fuck did it get to this point. It was only suppose to be a funny story I post and maybe get gold. It turned to a situation where now im about to tell my brother something so awkward and terrifying to me. 

I get home and go upstairs where my brothers at. I say ""sup"" and he tells me about class and other shit. Im in my head the whole time like ""fuck its about happen"". I look at him laughing nervously. 

Bro: What?!

Me: haha oh god

Bro: What?!

Me: Hey remember when--haha-when 

I was dying slowly inside couldnt even look him in the eye

Me: Remember when I-- hahaha-- took pictures of.... your asshole

Bro: WHAAAAAT?! YOU DID?!! HAHAAHA WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 

Me: You dont remember at all?

BRO: NOOOOOO! WTF??!! HAHHAHA

I reveal everything that happened and showed him the post, he was dying. I was also dying but on the inside with cringe and awkwardness.  He didnt even remember, now he will forever remember what I did to him. How the fuck did my brother's asshole get to the top post?

TLDR: told my brother, lots of wtfs and lmaos, doesnt remember at all, my top post is about my bros asshole, he will remember this for the rest of his life. But hey 8 platinums is 8 platinums.",tifu

TIFU by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home,"My friend Jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and I finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  I ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

So, today I fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

TL;DR Today I fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",tifu
TIFU by introducing my pitbull to my kitten,"So, a little bit of backstory: 

My mom used to work in a barn caring for horses. One day somebody came with a dog. It was emaciated looking, and had scars on its face. My mom felt bad for it and brought it home. We found that it was abused as a puppy and abandoned. It's now five years later and she's healthy and resilient. She's scared of anybody raising objects around her or making loud noises due to her past, but she's protective of her family and a lovely dog for the house. She's been a bit overprotective recently, growling at passersby on walks, and it's something we're working on. Being that she's a muscular, intimidating looking dog, people tend to stay away anyway. Other than that, she's a perfect pitbull.

We also just adopted a kitten (8 weeks old) and it's the tiniest, most adorable animal I've ever owned. After around a week we decided to introduce the dog to the kitten, with strict supervision. We brought them both into the kitchen and put them on the ground. Surprisingly, they sniffed each other and walked away with little interest. Oh, whatever. 

So me and my gf have to run to Walmart so we leave the two of them together, knowing they weren't really interested in one another. We leave for around half an hour, and are shocked when we walk in.

Our pitbull is in the corner of the living room, SHAKING, with her eyes open wide as the kitten pounces and chases after her tail. She's yipping at the baby kitten that weighs less than a pound. We separate them into different rooms while in tears laughing and make a note not to let them in the same room together for a while.

TLDR: Left pitbull with tiny kitten, pitbull ends up cowering in the corner while kitten plays with her tail.


EDIT: all those saying this was irresponsible, I'm going to add that they had met a few times previously and we made sure that the pitbull didn't display aggressive behaviours toward the kitten. I am qualified with animal behaviour, and all safety was ensured. My mother was also at my house at the time.

My wife is pregnant with our daughter. I'm really excited and happy for us. But my wife is convinced that  I'm cheating on her. She gets these weird dreams where I cheat on her.

WIBTA If I don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins?,"

Some background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

This is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

Here's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. 


Now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. 

This is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
No matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

I can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. 

I do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

But this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million.

AITA for expecting my daughter to help her brother?,"Me (50sM)

My daughter (32/f)

My son (27/m)

I love my kids equally.  

My daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  We don't charge her rent and so she's built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

My son is a bit more aimless.  He has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  He supports them (gf doesn't work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  They have lived in Airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

Last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  Apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  There's no way he'll be able to pay that off on his current job.  He has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it's going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  Meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  The debt will inevitably grow with interest.  My wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

I don't want my son to file for bankruptcy.  It would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  I believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  When I pass all my children will have is each other.  They should learn how to rely on each other more.  

I told my daughter I think she should loan son the money.  She got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  Her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.

"Journalism is no longer and honest and legitimate profession, and should be treated as such.","Granted, I know historically journalists have had their share of ""yellow journalism"" and other poor moments. I also know everyone's got opinions on what the ""news"" actually is -- Fox, CNN, I don't care, let's put politics aside for a moment to look at other agenda-pushing BS. Consider how many reputations the media has tarnished in their crusade for a headline. Consider how many ""scares"" we've had because journalists take one potentially interesting tidbit from a story or a study or something and twist and twist until its a big fucking deal, when it really should have been treated as the molehill it was.

Journalism is just activism in sheep's clothing. Why? Because juicy stories sell to the masses. Journalists should be treated with the same skepticism nowadays as used car salesmen, and perhaps more so. 

We need to stop pretending that journalism is about truth -- its not. Its about stirring the pot, riling emotions, getting a reaction out of the public. Not a single one should be trusted; assume all journalists are inherently predatory or ignorant, or both.",unpopularopinion

Update: Me (36M) found out that my wife (34F) was cheating on me with multiple men,"In my original post I was still unsure what to do as seen here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me\_36m\_found\_out\_my\_wife\_34f\_has\_been\_cheating\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me_36m_found_out_my_wife_34f_has_been_cheating_on/) 

But after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, I got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. I finally opened my eyes to what I had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that I would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so I decided last thursday to tell her I wanted to end this marriage.

I think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. She didn't even try to persuade me or anything. Just went like a broken record ""nothing I say will change anything"" whenever I asked her to say anything. There was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. We have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

My mother knows everything, but I for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. Maybe I'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so I agreed to give her time to tell them. When we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. Instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. They have been part of my family for almost 17 years and I care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. I felt really bad about lying to them, but I'm afraid that if I go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. But my patience is not limitless. I will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

I don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. I'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". I also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

Now there are some big loose ends to tie. We need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. The custody will be shared where I will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. I also feel like their legal address should be with me, so I won't have to pay her child support. Would be unfair after what she did. I have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. I will fight for my kids though.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"&#x200B;

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

I've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. I've also read through a lot of the comments. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. There's been A LOT of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. It's whatever at this point.

We had been texting off and on all evening. As promised, I agreed not to bring it up in person. When I got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. I was a little nervous not knowing what I might be walking into, but overall I just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. When I walked in it was clear so did she. Her sister was helping her pack up her things. I didn't know what to say, but I never expected this. I honestly thought everything was going to be okay when I got home. Her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

I walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. She didn't say anything either. She didn't even look at me. If she was going to leave I at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. Everything I had read in the comments about buying a bidet and OCD lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than I had considered. I started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""YOU PUT THIS ONLINE? I TOLD YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!"" Her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. She then accused me of cheating. WHAT? This whole thing has been crazy and I feel like I had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. I snapped.

I told her sister I had never cheated. Not once. I would never cheat on her. Enough was enough, so I told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier I had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. Everything went silent. Like, no one said a word. Out of nowhere they both start crying. Her sister stared yelling at me and told me I shouldn't be talking about things I don't understand. When I asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that I need to mind my own business.

1. Her sister knows about it. (She did not know I posted on Reddit about it)
2. Her sister thinks it's normal.
3. I need to mind my own business? They're MY SOCKS!

I stood there all kinds of messed up so I just left. I went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. I also called off work today. I went home and all her stuff is gone. I didn't text her back. I think I'm done.

To clarify a few things: She insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. She told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. She reaffirmed it's not a fetish. She won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. I can't keep up with the comments. I'm pooped. (I'm trying to find humor in this because I'm really upset :(

So yeah.

Edit: (a sentence) Her sister did not previously know I posted about it on Reddit. I'm sure they both do now. ",relationship_advice

TIFU by having the best dream at the wrong time,"I had the most vivid sex dream the other day. The kinda dream no one would want to wake up from. I was one of the founding members of the X-Men, and I was balls deep in mutant pussy. So, fucking was literally my superpower. I could cure the sick with my cum. Humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. Including the members of the X-Men. So, in this dream, I was fucking Blink and Jubilee. Sparks were flying in the bedroom. I mean, damn. I never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. But deep down in dreamland, I gave *all* the fucks. I experienced the most explosive orgasm. I woke up at that moment.

Oof. I was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. I'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. Especially if you're wearing loose pants. I locked eyes with the passenger next to me. She wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. It had the words ""Best Mom Ever"" on the pillow case. *Of course it had*. At that point I realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. I was too embarrassed to really speak, but I managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. She shook her head as if to say ""don't mention it"". And then she said this fucking shit: 

""Don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep""

""I'm sorry?""

""I have a son who's also into X-Men""

Thanks for all the responses, from the believers to the none believers, you're all equally entertaining! For those of you asking for photos of the pillow, once I got off the plane, I snatched my bags and rushed to the nearest bathroom, where I changed pants. Once I did that, I tossed the pillow in the trash. An Uber was waiting to take me straight to my new job. No fucking way was I gonna bring a ""best mom ever"" pillow into the new office. This fuck up needs no sequel.*

TIFU by cussing out 916 people.,"This happened last night. 

So I'm a theatre kid at my high school and our first night of our play was last night. The day before, everyone on the cast was given brand new LAV microphones (the wire mics that you tape to your face). Unfortunately, I didn't know this. See, the old mics were only activated by the sound director, meaning it only worked if a switch on the sound board was flipped. The new ones, however, turn on automatically when you pass a certain area on stage. I think you can kind of see where this is going. 

So anyways, there was one part where I had to strip my costume (button-down shirt and khakis essentially) and change into a very pg-13 toga costume, then put my original costume back on as quickly as possible. So after I get up on stage, do my cute little toga thang, rush back offstage to return to my original outfit. Once I was offstage, I began changing directly in front of the door I had just exited. This was because I had forgotten that someone else had to get on stage before I returned. So this asswipe rushes past me, and with the force of Thor Almighty, and swings the door wide open, exposing my asscheek to THE ENTIRE CAST AND A GOOD 40% OF THE AUDIENCE. I freaked the fuck out and turned into [Patrick fucking Star](https://youtu.be/Kaqa2N_O-KE) as I ran to shut the door. Here's the FU. 

So here I am, half naked, shivering, super embarrassed, I reached out to grab the doorknob. I made eye contact with the guy who had just made me flash all these poor people, and I instinctively gave him a good ol' fashioned American ""MOTHERFUCKER!"". I swear to fucking god the door stretched as I was reaching for the doorknob, because next thing I know, I was on stage, PANTS STILL DOWN, and heard a sea of gasps flood the auditorium. Turns out the mic boundary was just barely passed where I was standing. So yes, the cast, the crew members above and behind me, as well as the 860+ wonderful audience members heard me loud and clear. On top of that, I didn't just say it, I screamed, so that shit echoed and bounced off the walls like crazy. Here's what it was like from the audiences perspective:

""Say, do you like canned salmon?""
""I'm quite fond of it, yes.""
*door opens*
""Oh, there he is! This is my husb-""
*skinny Asian boy with red boxers waddles on stage*
""MOTHERFUCKER^fucker^^fucker^^^fucker!""
*door slams*
""....Well....how do you do Madame?""

Safe to say I'll never be in another production at my school again. 

TL;DR- I unintentionally flashed like 200 people, then waddled with my pants at my ankles to close the door, screamed a vulgar word, and became the most infamous theatre student at my school. 

In words of the old Western prospectors: GOLD! YEEE-HAWWW!!! Thanks, Stranger!

Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

The way I (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. How do i tell people when they ask,"So I met my boyfriend a year ago. I posted on my cities subreddit that I was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

I got about 50 messages all together. One guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. I love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. I gave him my number and we texted all night. Our first phone call was over an hour.

He told me he was also lonely. I mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. He offered to cuddle me. We decided to have a cuddle date

We met up the following week. He picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. We got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

That's how we met. I know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. People have asked how we met and I've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  I don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?",relationship_advice
AITA? I (21F) just had an abortion and my bf (29M) thinks I'm overreacting,"Hi all, I'll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.
I  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( I'm on the pill and he wears a condom). I have no idea what happened but I still managed to get pregnant. I immediately decided to get an abortion.
I asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. He said he didn't want to take a day off. Full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.

So whatever, he told me he wasn't coming and that I had to take care of it. This was a week ago. The procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. I went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. I thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as I just had a tough day and was emotional at best. 
He then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.
So I immediately started bawling because I just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn't wanted and I don't regret it, but it doesn't mean I feel sensitive about it). He became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that I was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. He didn't apologize and we went to bed upset. I woke up in the middle of the night because I was cramping and sore, so I went on his couch and had a good cry. Apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if I was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights ASAP because I was being inconsiderate.

AITAH? I feel like he doesn't give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it's the 'pregnancy hormones' making me whiny.

ETA: thank you all for your judgement and messages. I'm going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. To those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn't want it. Regardless, I want to at least understand his motivations. I will try to post an update when this is all over. Thank you again.

I am at my wits end, what can I do to stop it?","**edit2: putting this here since this is locked. Thank everyone for all the advice/support. I will be following some of the advice recieved and update once I have one. If this works I'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what I've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance I'll have no choice but to move. Thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. That has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. Yeah it sucks but worst case I can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. And even though the NYPD has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. Hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've Found myself in for what it is. Will update when I can.**


*Edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home SEVEN times. and this is common.*

I live in Brooklyn NY. I purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by Orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by Orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. I honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

Since i moved in though, this has been a HUGE issue. I don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. I honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. The issue is that they have been using the Jewish police to harass me. 
To give you an idea of the shit I am dealing with I'll tell you what prompted this post.  I chose to have a Superbowl viewing party today. About 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were FIVE people here) I get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. We were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). My condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   Since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people I INVITED from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. I don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that I have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

I am fucking done. I want this to stop. I have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. I have tried calling the NYPD every time they show up. This has not worked. I have complained to my condo association. No help. I have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city AND state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and NOTHING has worked. I keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home THAT I OWN WITH MY PERMISSION. 

Im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. I am just so fed up with this bullshit. I am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a HOME I OWN on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

AITA for letting my picky eater child go hungry?,"My four year old has decided to become a picky eater. He doesn't have autism or anything else that causes sensory issues, he's just picky now, he used to be willing to eat anything. If he had his way he'd only eat french fries and Goldfish. Obviously I'm not going to let him only eat those two things. I'm also not going to be bossed around by a toddler. What I've been doing is that if he turns up his nose at a meal, I'll just say something like ""Alright, I guess you can eat this later"" and put the food in the fridge. If he asks for a snack, I offer him the food, and if he refuses, no snacks except for milk; at the next meal, I'll offer it to him then if he didn't eat it before. He carries on for a bit, but he eventually gets hungry enough that he'll eat whatever it was he was refusing to eat before. He's never gone more than a day of refusing to eat, if he did I'd probably feed him something else. My mom friends are horrified I'd do this to my kid, and tell me I'm old fashioned. I also feel like the worst mother in the world when my kid is whining about how hungry he is. For the record my husband is completely on board with this method. AITA for letting him go hungry?

EDIT: This must have reached the front page or something, thanks for all your comments, I'm a bit too overwhelmed to reply to them all. Even though this sub I just want to address some common points:

"""OK boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from Millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.","Facts:

•	Millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did—despite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	Cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	There is not one single state in the United States where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	Student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in America, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	Cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


For example, the Bureau of Census reports that the average price of a new home in June 1998 was $175,900.

According to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. The same report places the average sale price for June 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

A gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in June 2014, when adjusted for inflation. The actual national average price, as of July 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

The median household income in 1998 was $38,885. The most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. The Bureau of Census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

This did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. CEO salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

Millennials TRULY have it harder than our parents did.

•	We cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

And yet, Boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. That we're lazy and entitled. 

No, we're not. The data shows that Millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

For years now, when Boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

We learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. So now we just say, ""OK boomer"".

My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry her and I'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?,"Not sure if this belongs in this sub because it isn't my relationship I'm asking for advice about. If not, apologies. 

Tldr: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend of 6 years to marry him, and I'm the only one who knows the truth about how unfaithful she's been to him. He's completely blinded by love and to him she can do no wrong. I know it might not be my place to say anything but I don't want him to make a huge mistake.

So my good friend ""Aaron"" and his girlfriend ""Mary"" have been together for almost 7 years. They meet in college and are in a very close relationship. Personally I would call them extremely codependent. Neither of them really have any friends aside from each other. She doesn't let him have guy friends. In fact she doesn't let him do a lot of things. He's not allowed to go out past 11, not allowed to drink or smoke, she has to approve of all of his friends, and he's not allowed to be alone with other girls. She's got this guy on a tight leash. 

The reason why they're still together is that Aaron is completely whipped, and to him she can do no wrong. He talks regularly about how amazed he still is that she finds him attractive. (He's a decent looking guy, but she's like super model level good looking) 
They post cutesy couple photos every day (im pretty sure she makes him post them) and to everyone who sees them they appear to be the perfect magical fairytale couple.

Anyway a few weeks ago he told my boyfriend and I that he was planning on proposing to Mary. Of course we congratulated him because he seemed super excited. 

Now here's the issue: a few weeks prior to this, I hung out with a friend of Mary- ""Alison"". Alison told me about a party they went to where Mary got drunk and slept with her ex. After the party they began hooking up regularly, and she had a threesome with him and a friend of his. Aaron has no knowledge of these hookups. 

I told my boyfriend about it because he shares my friendship with both of them, and he believes that we need to say something but I'm not so sure how to even go about that. It will destroy him, ruin their entire relationship and maybe a friendship as well. However I think in the long term he will be unhappy with a marriage where she's so controlling. Not even that, but if she's completely okay with cheating on her long term partner it will be the same once they're married. 

Is telling him the right thing to do?

Edit: to clarify, the cheating has not been going on for 6 years (as far as I'm aware) and the hookups occurred recently.

Edit 2: some of the commenters are calling me a bad friend for not telling him immediately. After giving it some thought and reading the comments, I have decided to tell him as soon as I can, most likely tonight if he's free to hang out. To those saying I'm being a bad friend for waiting: this is a huge deal, and it will greatly affect the future of Aaron, and I want to make sure I break the news in the correct way. This man is blinded by love. He's not going to be expecting this news at all and his whole life is about to change. I'm definitely not going to do nothing, because he deserves much better than this woman, and he deserves to know the truth about what he's getting into if he still decides to marry her. I'm expecting a full blown shit storm, I'm expecting him to be hurt, angry, in disbelief. I don't believe it's wrong that I'm asking for a bit of advice on how to approach this. Should I have told him sooner? Maybe, but what difference would a few weeks make? For all those asking, I'll post an update when I do it.

Edit 3: I've talked to Aaron since I posted this and he is coming over tonight to talk/hang out. My bf and I are going to tell him together because he knows the situation as well. A few of you have suggested I talk to Mary first to give her a chance to come clean. While that's a good idea, I'm not as close to her as I am to Aaron, and I don't see that going over well. I would much rather tell him and leave it to him to decide what to do from there

Edit 4: new information has been received from the third party friend Alison. She has sent me screenshots of texts that do prove Mary has been involved with her ex. They send messages regularly and he has sent her nudes.

Edit 5: lmao I'll just mention that Aaron just got to our house (8:00pm EST) will update later if I can. Thank you all so much for the kind messages and helping me work this hot mess out. Ive been stressing about this all day but I believe I am doing the right thing in telling him.

Edit 6: quick little edit. (11:00 EST) We all talked for a good bit, I told him what I heard from Alison and it went better than expected, but he was still pretty mad and upset. We are all just chilling and drinking now- I'll post the whole story tomorrow. Thanks again for all the replies!",relationship_advice
Trump is visiting a class in an elementary school where they are talking about words and meanings,"The teacher asks Trump if he would like to lead the class in a discussion of the word ""tragedy"".

""Not quite"", says Mr. Trump, ""that would be an accident.""

A little girl raises her hand: ""if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.""

""I'm afraid not,"" explained the president. ""That's what we would call a great loss.""

The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. ""Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? ""

Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, ""If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.""

""Fantastic!"" exclaimed Mr. Trump. ""That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?""

This coworker also does not ask our supervisor beforehand if it's alright to do this, she just brings the kid in. 

Also, when she has her kid here, numerous people come over to our office to chat and coddle the kid and ""meet"" the kid and baby talk the kid and it's really disturbing when you're trying to concentrate on writing or creating graphics for a project.

"Telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.","There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

(Update) School kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. Lawyers are expensive...,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

The past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. Now I can't go into a lot of the details after but I can go over some of the details that happened during.

We contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. We first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

Our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. Then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. So he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. Talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which I thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

He spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. During this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. Something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

So our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. The lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

Finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

Now I can't go into a lot of the details but I can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. Lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. I just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. We are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

Thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",legaladvice
"Update - I posted a bunch of creepy texts guys have sent me, onto Facebook and Instagram.","This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hqz2h/i_25f_posted_a_bunch_of_creepy_texts_guys_have/

 To recap my last submission, I posted an album of creepy texts I'd recieved from men in my field (computer engineering). Some from classmates and a TA in college, some from people I met through internships and professional development activities, and some I know through my current job. I had been so fed up with the sense of shame and being silenced and not believed, about sexual harassment. And, for what it's worth, putting a large collection of harassing and threatening texts in the public eye, raw and unedited, made them difficult to ignore or explain away. After that post, I got a meeting invitation from my company's HR department, for this Monday.

A lot happened over the weekend. I did a lot of research into employment law, I read through the whole company handbook again, and for each person I mentioned in my social media posts, I wrote out up a detailed account of their behavior towards me for my own reference, stuff that had not been said over text.

I also screenshot and backed up any angry or threatening texts towards me, that I received this weekend from the men whose old texts I'd posted online.

----

I think its worth giving some background on the four people included in my social media posts that I knew from my current job.

(Coworker 1) A few months ago, I had reported him to HR for sexual harassment in the past, and he was moved off my team to another position in the company where he would not have any contact with me. He had signed a paper saying that he must not contact me for any reason, whether that is work related or not. I didn't sign anything during this process.

The messages from him that I posted on Facebook were old texts from him, to my personal phone. Making a comment about how I looked nice at work, and how I must have been dressing up for him. I'd replied that I was not. He asked me who I was dressing up for at work, if not him. Because then he'd know who to be jealous of. I said 'myself' and told him to stop texting me on my personal phone. A few days later, he sent me a message telling me my new hair color was ""hot"" and asking me to drinks. That was a small snippet of creepy things he'd sent me, there was plenty more that I didn't post.

I found out today that he was the one who showed HR my posts, as I understand it, he had assumed I had signed a similar no-contact agreement that he'd had to. I had not ever made that agreement, in writing or vocally. I'd just not been talking to him because I had no desire to.

(Coworker 2) He was married, and in the office, he didn't seem to do anything out of line. He had my number since I would be traveling for work and wanted my team members to be able to contact me. (We don't have work cell phones) 

Out of the blue, he texted me asking me to join him at a fancy seafood restaurant when I returned from my work trip. It sounded like a date. I texted back ""uh you're married"" and he said some shit about how nobody would have to know, and how I seemed like a girl who could keep a secret. I told him to fuck off. 

He was fired a week later for unrelated reasons, so while I'd been thinking about going to HR, I never did. I haven't heard from him since, even after my social media post.

(Coworker 3) He was also married. One time I was at a work happy hour and I left pretty early. He texted me on my work instant messaging platform, which I have on my phone, asking me to go party with him. I asked ""Is your wife coming"" and didn't get a response. I didn't think it was bad enough to report to HR as sexual harassment, because something usually has to be done repeatedly to qualify as harassment, unless it is something egregious. (That was in the company handbook, in less concise words) 

That text exchange was included in my post.

After my post, he sent me a slew of threatening texts. Apparently his wife had seen the post, and I had ""ruined his family"". He said that I was about to ""get what was coming 4 me real soon"", and to ""watch out"" which sounded like a threat. Also called me a couple homophobic slurs. (I'm openly bisexual)

(Coworker 4) He had just broken off an engagement. I didn't hear that from him, just through the rumor mill. He contacted me asking me if I wanted to go out, and I said that he wasn't really my type to date. He said that he wasn't looking for anything serious, just casual sex. I didn't reply for a few hours and then he sent me a second text saying ""Well then go ahead and be a bitch and leave me on read""

Since it happened outside of work, and was not any kind or repeated harassment, I also didn't think that it would be reasonable to bring it to HR unless I saw a pattern of similar behavior. He didn't contact me again, even after my post.

------

As for people from past jobs, internships, or classes...

My college contacted me about my old TA who had tried to hook up with me repeatedly, and stopped helping me with the course when it was clear he wasn't getting anywhere. They asked me if I'd give a statement. Apparently he was still doing that shit, and someone else had reported him. And they saw from my post that I'd likely have something to report too.

A married guy who tried to get with me when I was an intern at another company sent me some really angry and threatening texts, I have to figure my instagram post (with his public Instagram account tagged) caused problems in his marriage. I definitely have been taking extra steps to stay safe when I'm leaving my apartment or going anywhere. I'm considering reporting this to the police because it was the most overtly threatening thing I've received.

A few other people I tagged sent me texts telling me how shitty it was not to keep private conversations private, etc. I ignored all those.

-----

As for what happened this morning, in my HR meeting... I was all ready to go in with (metaphorical) guns blazing, defend everything I'd said or done with sources from the company handbook.

Such as how I did not violate the company social media policy, as it only prohibited pretending to speak for the company as a whole if PR is not your job, or reveal confidential code or design or business contracts online. (I didn't mention my company in my post, or anywhere else on my social media)

I was also ready to defend how I followed the guidelines of what is considered sexual harassment and should be reported. How I reported repeated harassment, but didn't report isolated incidents that were not extreme. (The examples of extreme conduct included unwanted overtly sexual touching, or threats of violence. The handbook specifically mentioned that asking someone out once was not harassment)

But the meeting ended up being much more low-key than I had been expecting.

I'd taken down both posts Sunday, as an act of good faith, though I doubted that would matter much.

When I went in, I sat down and asked if I could record the meeting. The HR representative (I'll call her Beth here but that's not her real name of course) said Ok. She wanted to talk about each of the specific people I'd posted screenshots from, who work at the company. (Those made up less than a third of my screenshots FYI)

First was Coworker 1. The guy I had previously reported to HR and who had been moved to a different team and told that he must not speak to me or contact me. Beth said that he had brought the posts to her attention, as he was under the impression that the ""no contact"" agreement went both ways. I reminded her that I had not entered into a written or verbal agreement. I was surprised it was him who brought it up, but I didn't say anything. She asked if there had been continued harassment or contact from him after my initial report. I said no. She moved on to the next quickly.

Coworker 2 had been fired a while back for unrelated reasons, but Beth still asked if there had been any further conflict between us, while he was employed, other than the text messages. I said no.

She asked me the same question about Coworker 3. I told her that I had received texts from him on Saturday, that came across as threatening, and used several slurs about my sexuality. I gave her a printout of those messages. She read them, and immediately stepped out to show them to her manager. She came back after a few minutes to continue talking with me.

And again for Coworker 4. I told her that he had not contacted me after he said I was a bitch for leaving him on read

Beth asked me if I had any questions, and I basically asked what her next steps would be. She said that she would have asked me to remove the posts so that things could be handled with discretion, however I had already removed both prior to the meeting.  She also said that she would be meeting again with Coworkers 1 and 4. She also said that due to coworker 3's threatening comments, he had been escorted out of the building while we had been speaking. Fired. Apparently he was already on record with them, for another issue relating to his temper, and this was the last straw.

She also asked me why I had not brought coworkers 2, 3, and 4 to her attention before. And I cited the section on harassment from the company handbook, saying that harassment was repeated unwanted comments or actions. And that a single event is not usually considered harassment unless it is extreme. The conversations with those three men had been isolated incidents.

She asked me if I would be more comfortable taking a personal day for the rest of the day, while she speaks to Coworkers 1 and 4. She said she wanted to make it clear that I was not being dismissed or escorted out, I was not getting fired, it was only a precaution so that I would not be around Coworkers 1 and 4, in case either of them wanted to confront me personally. I said I would.

So that's where I'm at right now.

last night, he came home from the pub drunk at maybe 2am. i was busy the next day so i slept early and didn't wait for him to come back home. when he walked into our room, he slammed the door open, took off his clothes, and jumped on top of me. he said he wanted to  have sex, and i told him that im too tired to have sex, so he said fine and got up to go to the bathroom.

minutes later, i heard him come back into the room grunting (he's a relatively big guy). he climbed into our sheets fully naked, and started playing with my body. i was tired, but it felt nice so i didnt stop him. then he whispered in my ear ""wanna try anal?"" but i didnt hear him properly, so i just said ""sure, just make it quick."" he then tried to go in, with just his saliva. too dry for even the regular. when i felt it, i immediately told him to stop, and that he was going for the wrong hole. he didn't listen and continued anyway. he plunged himself deeper and it was extremely painful. i screamed our safe word (""b******n"") 5 times and he didn't respond. he just kept going while i was suffering. he covered my mouth to muffle my screaming, and the pain was so intense, i passed out.

when i woke up in the morning, he was gone, and when i got up, i saw blood on our sheets. i was really scared, so i canceled my plans and headed straight to the hospital in a maxipad. after going to the ER and doing some tests, it turns out his forceful entrance caused a fissure in my anus. the doctor said i would have to use some medication and that, if the fissure hadn't healed in 4 or 5 weeks, i would have to get surgery.

i just got out of the hospital and am going back home soon. i haven't seen my boyfriend or spoken to him since yesterday. i dont know where he is (nor do i want to), and i honestly don't know how im going to deal with him. what do you think i should do? please help me deal with this.",relationship_advice
"I'm tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from ""woke"" POC and LGBTQ+ communities","I'm a pansexual black/Cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. Throughout these 5 years I've seen so many people who swore they were ""woke"" proceed to do a poem that isn't much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. At the end of these poems, most POC go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they've done nothing but try to be an ally. 

This kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  A person of color can post anything about white people. They can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying ""I hate white people"" and be fine. Same thing with queer people and straight people. 

And I get it. I'm Black, Cuban, queer, and a woman. I'm made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. My gender has been put down for centuries. I would've had to force myself into the closet if I was born a couple of centuries earlier. I know what it's like to be hated for who I am. I know what it's like to feel angry for what's been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. But I don't compliment these poems. I don't applaud. I don't like these posts. Because it's wrong. This is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. This is all just tit for tat. 

You're not woke if you:

- Make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can't take it back in your direction. 

-Use generalizations like ""all white people"" or ""all straight people"" but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like ""all black people"" or ""all queer people. 

-Refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they're a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn't want to interact with you because you're a queer person of color. 

-Push allies away when they're trying to help you. 

-Think you're better than anyone because of your identity. 

Everyone has the right to be who they want. To be proud of their identity. You have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn't be hated and put down for it. But you shouldn't put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

Next time you write a status or a poem about the ""other"" side, insert blanks on every time you name them. Insert something represents you into the blanks. Then read the poem and visualize someone from the ""other"" side reading it back to you. Do you feel put down? That's what you're doing to others. 


TLDR: Love yourself but don't put other people down in the process.

11 Minutes,"A cop was patrolling late at night in a well-known lover's spot, famous for all obscene activities. He sees a couple in a car, with the interior light brightly glowing.

The cop carefully approaches the car to get a closer look.

The young man lowers his window. ""Uh, yes, officer?""

The cop says: ""What are you doing?""

The young man says: ""Well Officer, I'm reading a magazine.""

"New York- Mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while I was babysitting 4 year old step sister","Hi folks

I'm a 21 year old college student. My parents separated soon after I was born, and my my mom raised me alone until I was 15. She met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister Eliza. She's grown up with me, and I often baby sit for her for short periods of time. I live with a roomate in apartments owned by the College

Late last week, my stepfather's mom died. He's Polish, so my mom and he left for Poland leaving me to babysit Eliza for a week. Yesterday, I got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in Poland. I've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

I have no idea what to do. My biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. My mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the USA that I am aware of. I'm studying Political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but I have no job and no salary. 

Eliza has no family other than me that I can turn to. I'm not ready to take of a child, but I also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and I've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. But we also look very different- my dad is Jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. So I'm a tall, mixed race dude while Eliza is a small blonde girl (I bring this up because I was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

So what do I do? I'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and I haven't even told Eliza yet. It just hit me that we're now alone, and I now have to step up to the plate and take care of Eliza. I have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

Edit: Thank you for all you advice. I apologize if I do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

Edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. However, I am currently ok, and my mom's friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and I also have a little bit saved up. But I greatly appreciate your generosity",legaladvice
My 4 person airsoft team apparently traumatized a small child — but I'm not buying it.,"I'm apart of an airsoft team. We participate in military simulation and similar events. 4 of us were practicing clearing rooms — at my own external tornado shelter, which is on the opposite side of the house as this neighbor. 

This is in Illinois 

We all wear camouflage masks, tacvests, pants kneepads and etc. 

We set up BB mesh to catch stray BBs. We practiced the clearing, and used extremely small single explosive firecrackers as grenades (which are commonly used in local airsoft fields) 

The 6 year old APPARENTLY heard the firecrackers, came around the front of our house and onto our side yard, at first didn't see us, and then saw us come out of the tornado shelter and was traumatized.

We never saw the 6 year old. 

The mother came to me (property owner) a day later, said that the police were called by the 6 year old, apparently the 6 year old thought we were murderers, and demanded we pay for his mental health treatment. I refused. 

The child looked perfectly fine playing outside, but the mom repeatedly got in my face over it. I also never saw the police that were apparently called. 

She's threatening to take legal action now, and has thrown unknown chemicals on our property over the fence that have killed our grass. What do we do? ",legaladvice
"[Manitoba, CANADA] My cousin lives in a basement suite. His landlord has recently enacted a new rule in their home that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - which is enforced via circuit breakers to ""save on power"" and lower landlord's power bills, except my cousin is paying for his own power.","As the title states, my cousin is currently renting a basement suite in the house of an older gentleman who owns the property. Legally, the renting situation is done by the book and follows the law to a T. However, three weeks ago my cousin received a notice stating that there will be a new addition to the rules that says ""Lights Out By 10PM"". My cousin isn't overly bothered by this as he is usually in bed by 9PM anyways, and he can understand his elderly landlord wanting peace and quiet at night. Unfortunately, he realized immediately (when it first came into effect) that this is enforced by the landlord by physically turning off the power to the whole house by use of the circuit breakers - aside from the breakers for the refrigerators and freezers. This leads to a few problems:

1. My cousin is unable to see where he is going when using the bathroom or getting water at night without the use of a flashlight or phone (candles are forbidden in the basement suite).
2. My cousin is unable to charge his phone overnight, which is a major issue as he needs it for an alarm and worries about it dying - leading him to potentially sleep in. He can't even run an extension cord from the same socket as the fridge and freezer because he might blow the breaker, and the new rule specifically states that extension cords are not permitted if they are going to be used to circumvent the new rule.
3. The landlord rarely turns on the power at the designated time (8am) due to him either sleeping in, going to church, or just straight up forgetting. This leads to shits, showers, and shaves in the dark (no bathroom window) and is generally an inconvenience.
4. My cousin pays for his own power, and therefore he should be allowed to use his power as he sees fit. Instead, he has to live with this situation because his landlord wants cheaper bills.


We both understand that this a silly first world problem, but he is tired of feeling like he's living the Amish lifestyle and wants to know if there is any legal recourse he could take to find common ground with his landlord. He isn't look to sue the poor man, he just wants to use his own power and is willing to make compromises so both of them are happy. If he could just have the breaker for the bathroom lights and the one for his nightstand/phone charger, he would be a happy camper - however his landlord refuses to budge.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to approach this? What kind of lawyer will he need in this situation? Thank you so much for taking the time read this and offering advice. It is GREATLY appreciated. Take care.",legaladvice
If your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse.,"
IMO a Dr or teacher should be able to contact CPS for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

Last night I saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. It broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

I don't know their circumstances and for the most part, I am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. However, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). A child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

These poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

Edit: Thank you for mentioning the factors I naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. These points are very valid and make a lot of sense. Perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

I had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

As anyone, I am speaking from my own experience and I did come from a family who struggled with money. I don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 I think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. My Doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. I have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

Edit 2: I remembered more of our eating habits as a child. We had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. We also spent a lot of time outside. All in all, EDUCATION is a huge influencer and EFFORT makes a difference!

[31M] Husband cheated on [27F] me with his fit and skinny gym friend,"I came home from work early (I'm an OB nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that.",relationship_advice

TIFU by falling deeply in love with my own smell.,"This didn't really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. This is a throwaway because I'm very embarrassed. Sorry about formatting, I'm typing this on mobile. My girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. It was a horrible event and I still haven't been able to get back into the game since. I was and still am very much in love with her. Now to the fuck up.

My favorite possession of all time is her pillow. It smells like her, and I usually sleep with it every night. I haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (I know, gross but I don't think straight anymore). I hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. But this morning when I went for a particularly long morning run I started smelling the smell. Really strong. It confused me but I wasn't going to start complaining.

This morning, about 20 minutes ago I arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. And the smell grew more pungent. This was the moment I realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, I got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. I'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell I thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

TL;DR- Slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.

Teachers should not be allowed to express their political opinions in school.,"Bit of context for this. When I was 16 (in 2006) I studies politics in the UK. Both my teachers supported Labour as did almost all of the class, but that isn't the issue. The issue came about when I made a prediction that the Conservatives would win the next general election (they did). Now, this wasn't me declaring any support for either party. It was literally just an observation. My teacher then went on to explain how bad the Conservative party is, how everybody in the class should vote Labour and that I was a 'Tory boy'. Basically for the next two years my opinions and views in class were null and void because, and I quote, ""don't listen to the Tory Boy"". Also, other classmates who had different opinions to the class and teachers aligned with them to make sure they didn't get the same vitriol thrown their way.

To be clear, I have no issue with teachers telling student's who they voted for. I do take issue when they seek to impose their opinions on the class. They're there to educate. Not dictate.

TIFU by accidentally faking my own death.,"I've been getting telemarketer calls incessantly for months and it's driving me insane, most of the time I just hang up once I hear them because I'm also expecting important calls from unknown numbers.

 I was with some friends one night and we decided to order some food from our regular place, the card machine was broken and I had no cash on me so I gave the delivery driver my details and she said she'd come back to my house with the working credit card reader the next night. 

Fast forward a few weeks and nearly 50 spam calls from telemarketers, I'd completely forgotten about the previous order. I get a call on my phone and I hear an Asian woman ask for me, mispronouncing my last name, not unlike many telemarketers. Fed up with it I yell ""No, he's not here because he died!""

Not even two hours later there's a knock on my door, it was the sweet delivery lady and she brought a free meal for my household as a sympathy gift to help everyone through the ordeal of my death, while telling us not to worry about the bill from the other week.

I had my friend drop off enough money for both meals without explaining it because I felt so bad. I can't explain it to them without sounding racist and now I have to find a new Chinese restaurant.

TL:DR - Thought the Asian delivery lady was a telemarketer, told her I died and she sent a sympathy meal to my family.

TIFU by encouraging female ejaculation [NSFW],"So I've been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we've cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit. This wasn't a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there's no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting.

That being said, a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive pornography-grade squirting. She goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how, and we proceed to make plans to explore this further. Next thing I know she's cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to extinguish a burning chemical factory while I'm right there dumping fuel on the flames.

Now, before I get carried away here, I'll just say, I'm a [M] nurse by trade, and I have no delusions about what's really going on. I can tell exactly where her 'juices' are coming from, and I've made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while I go down on her, no big deal.

So finally, to the point. She's been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and I've gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes. The most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss didn't taste at all like I'd thought it would. Ranging from unflavored Gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants (that you dump sugar packets into). I thought it was a fluke at first, but after repeatedly testing this observation, I'm quite certain that her piss tastes sweet, sometimes blatantly so.

The perverted side of me thought all this was kinky as hell, so I really didn't think on it too much until this morning. I just woke up and had a weird nurse's epiphany about it. Sweet urine. Glucose urine. Glycosuria. Jesus Christ. I'm a fucking dumbass. I race over to my bag where I keep my backup glucometer for work, wake her bleary-eyed ass up, and pricked her finger to check her blood sugar. 441. **Fuck!** Recheck. 453. **Shit!!** Asymptomatic, but hyperglycemic as fuck. She's got the Beetus. Diabetes. I broke the news as gently as I could, which was something to the tune of ""Holy shit fuck! That's some serious fucking diabetes! Call your doctor!"" Hysterics ensued. So now she's out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment, and I'm sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how I knew..

TLDR; TIFU by breaking some bad news to a girl after she ""squirted"" in my face and I diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet.

---------------------------------

UPDATE: Insert the obligatory ""omg this went supernova!!1"" .. On a serious note though, thanks for the reddit gold~~en shower~~. This has been a long day and I haven't felt this cool on the Internet since that time I used a voice modulator in an MMORPG to convince my guild I was a black guy.

To bring things current, the girl is doing fine now, they've ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she's a type 1 diabetic, but it'll take a few days and tests to confirm the preliminary results. She's got a lot on her mind, all I can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to irreversibly connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth.

Still, the response has been hilariously fantastic. While there's a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up, I'll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that, such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together, my majorly panicked reaction to it, and the resulting state of hysteria I had caused after scaring the girl half to death. That all kind of overshadowed the lucky guess I made, in my mind anyway. No longer though! Right now I feel like the fucking **man**, thanks for helping me see the cloud's golden lining!",tifu
AITA for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?,"Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

My girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

So basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

Well, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

My friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

I don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

My friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?

Please tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it. 

TL;DR: Apparently I'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

EDIT: This is epic.. I really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. Thank you to everyone that replied. I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

My (25F) best friend (25F) slept with an old crush at her bachelorette party and acts like nothing happened,"I'm torn between doing ""the right thing"" which would likely ruin a 20 year friendship or closing my eyes and looking the other way. Hear me out. 

Let's call her Jane. Jane and I have been friends and neighbors since we were 5. We went to college together and had a typical ""wild streak"" during those years, filled with lots of debauchery. We never did any drugs, though. That was our hard line in the sand. After graduating, we both got well paying jobs and essentially got our lives together. I am not married and still happily single, but Jane is engaged to be married to a great guy, let's call him Robert. Our families love him and over time, he also became my good friend. They're getting married in a beautiful destination wedding in September. I couldn't be more excited for them and Jane has been planning this event for close to a year. 

This weekend we had her bachelorette party which consisted of going to our country club with 8 other girl friends. The plan was to just swim, tan, BBQ, play volleyball, watch movies, drink cocktails, and reminisce. On Saturday morning, Jane comes to breakfast and tells us that she has a surprise for us. Okay, shouldn't be the other way around? Lol. Anyway, around noon, 6 dudes in swimming attire roll in. We were like, ""um, isn't this supposed to be a girls weekend?"" to which Jane replied, ""yeah but I figured you girls need some company"". We all laughed, however none of us ever even hinted at needing men. Turns out, this was just her cover and ruse to get guys in without making it obvious it was for her. We spent the day by the pool, playing volleyball and drinking. Now, most of the girls there were single so we got a little touchy feely with the guys. To our surprise, at some point towards the evening, I see Jane making out with a dude in the pool. I just brushed it off and went about my business. Another friend Karen walked up to me asking why is [name of guy] here. Initially I didn't know who she was referring to but then it clicked. I knew that dude looked familiar but couldn't put my finger on where from. Turns out, he was Jane's HUGE CRUSH in college. Classic football star, philanderer, handsome and charming guy. We both realized that the whole reason why she had invited these guys over was that she could casually spend time with her old crush. 

At that point I figured the party was taking a turn we weren't comfortable with so I walked up to Jane, pulled her to the side and essentially reminded her that she's getting married next month. She laughed me off, asking me to not ruin her party. I wasn't about to argue with her so I dropped it. They made out the whole night, in front of everyone else. Jane was sitting on his lap, kissing, petting, doing all sorts of inappropriate things. Another girl even tried to say that our party days should be behind us, we're grown ups now, not teenagers fucking in bushes. Nope, nothing could swing Jane. Around 2am, everyone went to the rooms. As expected, Jane and that guy spent the night in the same bedroom and I assume they were not playing board games. This morning, we all had breakfast, then the guys left, we checked out, and came back home. I talked to Jane earlier and she is back into the full wedding prep mode, talking about flowers and menus. 

Me and the girls discussed about whether we should have a serious talk with Jane. We've all seen other friends of ours getting married to the wrong people, being miserable, and getting divorced before they hit their 30s. I don't want this to happen to her. We're pretty much 50/50 on whether we should just forget what happened and never mention it again or have the talk with her. We all saw that she and that guy had some weird chemistry and seemed very comfortable with each other. I'm not sure if that was their first time together since college. I'm thinking that she might still have a thing for that dude but I am not sure how to bring it up with her without sounding harsh. What do we do?

TL;DR: my soon-to-be-married best friend slept with a friend from college and acts like nothing happened",relationship_advice
AITA Making my vegetarian daughter make her own meals,"Title basically sums it up I guess.

Daughter has decided she wants to be a vegetarian. I love meat and it's very rare for me to go without some kind of meat at dinner. 

My daughter naturally expects me to accommodate and cook vegetarian options for dinner too. I told her that if she wants to be vegetarian she can make her own dinner.

Wife told me I should cook veggie dinners for her, but shut up quickly after I asked if she wanted to start cooking dinner instead.

Naturally I am now the asshole in all of this.

AITA?

TIFU by announcing to my daughter that I only shave my vag when her dad is due home,"This literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.

For context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go. 

He realised that he had ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that I am, I offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
He commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and I assured him that that wouldn't be the case as I use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. Cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come. 

TL;DR Basically the title, and the fact that my 13-year-old daughter has learnt a bit more about her mother than probably either of us are comfortable with her knowing.

I think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. He is a doctor.,"This is in north Texas. 

Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. 

I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. 

I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. 

I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. 

I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. 

The next day he came over to ""Check on me"" and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. 

I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  

Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.

From what I'm seeing in the comments, a lot of redditors have some pretty terrible employers. IMO, if your relationship with your employer is so adversarial that their response to you knowing what you're worth and asking to get paid as such, is for them to fire you out of spite, I wouldn't be hanging around at that job even if they did give me the raise I want.

Some employers are great and will happily give you what you're worth, a lot of employers are scumbags who who try to milk you for everything you're worth while paying you jack shit, but plenty of employers are simply businessmen trying to get the best value for their buck, but will pay a valuable employee what they're worth if it makes good business sense.",LifeProTips
AITA for wanting him to keep his furry in check?,"Hi everyone.

My boyfriend broke up with me and told me its because I'm a horrible person for not accepting him. He's on reddit more than me (first time posting, hi) so he will definitely see this.

To keep the story very short: I met him a year ago - he was my first real boyfriend (I'm f/late 20s) and told me around our 5th date that he had recently started becoming a furry. Wasn't a dealbreaker for me and I really liked him, so we continued dating.

He started getting more deeply into it, bought two really scary fursuits for 5400€ (glow-in-the-dark eyes, jesus), asked me to have sex in the suits. Again, I accepted. Personally, I'm not into this whole thing at all but he was and I liked him, so it was all okay on my front.

Around our 6-month anniversary, he started to wear the fursuit pretty much all the time apart from work. That started annoying me because it was summer and super hot and more often than not I would end up having to sleep on the sofa because it got so hot in his bed. He got really upset about it and told me he needed me to buy a fursuit as well so we could be 'mates'. I declined (honestly, at that point it was mostly because I didn't have the money - I probably would have done it for him if he'd pestered my long enough).

Our relationship got worse but then my friend from back home asked me and a whole bunch of friends to dinner since she'd recently had a baby. BF was obviously invited.

He wanted to go in the fursuit and I told him no. He told me I needed to accept him and not be ashamed of him and I told him that we had agreed he could do whatever he wanted in his or my apartment but not during meetings with my family and friends because most of them wouldn't get it and I especially didn't want to have to explain to my grannie and older relatives.

He accused me of not accepting him, of being an intolerant and racist 'cunt', for not accomodating him and getting a fursuit on my own etcetc. and then broke up with me. He's been guilt-tripping me on social media and amonst our friends ever since and has made me feel horrible bc of this. The first few months afterwards I was honestly really freaking broken up about it and it's only been recently that I've been getting angry instead.

EDIT: I'm very overwhelmed by the responses, thank you to everyone who had something nice to say and made me feel better about the situation. Many of the comments gave me a lot to think about and I'm glad to know that people don't think I was acting horribly. Thanks again :)

EDIT2: An acquaintence let me know that he read this and isn't happy.

BF won't leave my scars alone and keeps bringing up things I've asked him not to. I finally snapped about it and he says I should be grateful.,"Some context first:

I'm(F) 19 this year, my partner(M) is 21. We've been together for about 6 months.
I've got minor-medium facial scarring on the left side of my face, and I have a prosthetic eye. Short story short wear bike helmets and don't be a fucking idiot when you're with your friends.

Alright, my boyfriend has been with me for 6 months now, and for the most part, we get along well. Now I'm gonna admit, my temper needs work because I can be snappy sometimes but I've made clear from the start that I don't want to talk about my scars nor have them be touched etc. It makes me uncomfortable and generally ruins any good mood in the situation. 

My issue is he keeps doing things like touching them with his fingers and calling me beautiful as if I want reassurance about the most fucking horrible thing about me. I try to be nice about it, but I just can't make it clear enough how much I hate it. He also makes comments about how I should get some stupid weird looking prosthetic with patterns and stuff and he doesn't get that I just want to look normal, I just want to be allowed to forget about that stuff as much as possible. 

I guess the problem is he doesn't get just how serious it is to me and that making light hearted jokes about it just makes me feel like I'm different and I hate it. I already have stupid questions from people who don't know me well that make me feel insecure, but he knows me and has been told.

I snapped about it last night and he went off saying that I'm making a big deal out of nothing and I should be grateful he's trying. Was I being unfair? I feel like it's okay for me to ask him to leave that part of me and my life alone so I can move on as best as possible but apparently not.",relationship_advice
AITA for not letting my wife borrow my car anymore,"Hello redditors

Me and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married for about 15 years. I'm very passionated about sports cars and I own for the time being only a sports car. This led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. I care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a ""milestone"" in life that I've worked very hard for. Well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that I was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. Now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.

So I told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as I neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when I sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.

So she got really upset about this and I told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. This blew into a pretty big fight and even though I didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out I still feel like she is pissed at me. So..

Edit: To clarify: the sports car is the only car that I currently own, I used to have another car but I sold it. I've planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.

Context update:  It's not like we barely have any money to spare. She makes over $100k a year (she makes a bit more than I do). And could go and buy a car today if she wanted to. The problem is just the fact that I don't let her drive MY car which is pissing her off.

Edit 2: Saw this post blow up and thanks for all the replies. Some made me think again on how this played out and I just wanted to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on the post.

1. My wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up by her driver. Yes driver. lol. (Provided by her work).
2. She only uses the car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when she is shopping ""heavy things"".
3. We've talked several times about her getting a car which she always postpones for some reason.
4. Yes, I did ""warn"" her that I would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.
5. I do no treat my wife as a child.
6. We have our own personal things that we own, she has a horse. The horse is HERS not mine. The car is MINE not hers. I'm not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted 50/50. We also own things together of course.
7. The reason I sold my ""other"" car is that I felt I already spent so much on this new car and I didn't want to have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and her occasional shopping and some other minor things.
8. A lot of people wanna know, the car is a 2017 911 991 Turbo
9. I'm not a multimillionaire and neither is she. That is the reason for why I'm not (as some people suggests) ""go out and buy her a car and get over with it"". I saved up for many many years for the car. I don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching my budget very very far.
10. A lot of people asking regarding the ""driver who picks her up"" and it not making sense earning 100k. I'm not sure it is normal at other companies but at hers they offer this service. My wife makes well over 100k, the reason I said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove my point that she can afford a car. She makes somewhere around 250. I make around 175. We have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into ""our own"" saving accounts. This is where I during the course of many many years saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. 
11. Both the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. Nobody else but her and the concrete pillars involved.

People aren't homophobic. You're just weird.,"I'm a gay guy. I've got a beard, a build, and I dress like most humans do. I don't lisp when I talk, and I don't spend my time gossiping about other people in a weird Jersey Girl accent (which would sound annoying enough on a woman). I don't dress in drag and attempt to stick my anus in the faces of bewildered pedestrians at exhibitionistic pride parades. People know I'm gay, and you know how much homophobia I've experienced in my life? ZERO. Not even from ultra conservative people.

I talk about my sex life like heterosexual people do, and my friends support it. No one bats an eye. I don't try to fuck my straight friends, first of all because they are my friends, and secondly because they are straight. No one feels weirded out in my presence.

Much of what we call homophobia today isn't an inordinate fear of gay people. It's not even really a fear. More of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

It's ok to be weird. It's ok to be offensive. It's ok to act like a girl if you are a guy. Just don't be surprised if the majority of the population finds you odd. Because you are odd. And your oddities have dick all to do with the fact that you like dick, and no one is responding inappropriately because you like dick.

Edit: to the dipshit posters here who are pointing out the existence of homophobic family members, READ MY POST. Stop confusing your emotional inertia for the content of my rhetoric. I said, very clearly, that ""MUCH of what we call homophobia today isn't..."" 

That's me saying to the daft ones here: yes, my post is hyperbolic. Yes, there is still real homophobia in our world.

Double Edit: to the mega dipshits who found an older post of me talking about my sexual experiences with women, your ignorance is mind boggling. I had two girlfriends out of high school (and by that I mean after high school, my second relationship was years past college ****) one short relationship with a girl in grade nine. And I've slept with plenty of randos. Nothing special. Talk to most gay guys and they'll admit they played the straight game for years, sometimes even decades before coming out. Now stop digging into my *sexual history like a bunch of voyeuristic weirdos and move along.",unpopularopinion

TIFU By Becoming an Accidental Active School Shooter,"This happened in the Oughties. TL/DR below.

My (relatively small) HS held an unexpected Live Active Shooter drill.  It was the first time they had ever done this. I don't know who developed this genius procedure. It actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

We had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. The teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... The trauma would help us react better? No idea. In fact, I remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.

However, it so happened that I was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. My teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. Now I understand why. (His mistake, but I played my part soon after)

On my way to the office (I was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. Emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. I was truly in a WTF state.

Here's where I F-up. Now I am the only dummy walking the hallways. Given the layout of this building, when I tell you it was dark, I mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. And it was completely silent now. It all happened in a matter of seconds. I can't say I was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. Still, given my aversion to our principal since I was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, I just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. I assumed my teacher knew what was happening and I didn't want to be in more trouble so I just yelled

**""HEY LET ME IN!!""**

The entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. This coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as I recall.  (Again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

Now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and I'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice I had heard in my life said

**""GET ON THE GROUND!!!""**

There was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! So whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought I somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, I don't know. He did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. He grabbed me up and took me to the office.

The rest was a huge blur but essentially I was not punished for THAT, but I got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. There was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. Parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

&#x200B;

TL/DR: Became unaccounted for just as an Active School Shooter Drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people.

TIFU by not correcting my cashier when she mistook me for a coworker.,"Today was my first day off work since Friday last week and I decided to run some errands. While I was out I ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store's EFTPOS was down. The cashier told me that they could still process the sale, I just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. 

On my drive home I realised that I had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so I swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. I got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. 

I'm a person with anxiety so I always prepare something to say when I'm inevitably asked how my day is going. I knew that I was going to respond with ""good, it's been pretty busy although I had a sleep in this morning since I was at work so late last night"". I got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went ""oh, are you not working today?"" and I just panicked. This wasn't what I had prepared for. So my stupid brain decided to go with what I had already prepared and I said ""nah I was working late last night so I'm not in today.""

The second it came out of my mouth I wanted to hit myself. Why didn't I just say that I didn't work there? Sure I could correct her now, but I'm already in too deep. 

So we start talking about work. She complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. For some reason I say that I'm lucky that I'm not working since it looks like it's a busy day. She asks me if I've heard anything about Shaun leaving. I said that I heard he is. She was upset about that, he's a nice guy. I agreed, he's one of the good ones. I have no fucking clue who Shaun is. 

I manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. We get to the point where I'm about to pay and what do you know, the EFTPOS is down.  Part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, I simply explain to her how to process the sale. Information I only know because I was at the other store two hours ago! 

She looks at me and goes, ""well at least someone who works here knows what they're doing."" I laugh nervously. Yeah...right. 

Then she asks me for my staff card to scan for ""my"" staff discount. And of course I don't have a goddamned card. Who do you think I am, an employee? Luckily since I had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse I managed to come up with a lie about how I didn't have my full purse so I don't have my card. That's alright though, she can put it through on hers and I can sign it. 

I signed a name that definitely wasn't mine. Is that illegal? Probably not. I then picked up my bags and ran. Didn't even say bye. I needed out of there. 

As I hurried away, I heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, ""did you know her?""

I don't think I can ever go back there. Either I'd have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. So I think I'll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. 

TL;DR: Cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. Instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. I got in deep enough that I was teaching her to process sales. After she gave me her staff discount I fled the store and now don't ever want to show my face again.

Edit: wow thanks for the silver! And because a few people have asked, yes I am in therapy. I have been on and off for almost ten years. I suffered from abuse for the majority of my life and while 99% of the time I'm perfectly functioning I do still have a compulsive need for people to like me because that it something I deem safe. Hence my inability to rock the boat by telling her that she thinks I'm someone I'm not. That could end in an unsafe situation and in those moments it's not a risk I'm willing to take.

Edit two: and some golds! Damn if I knew you guys enjoyed anxiety fueled fuckups then I'd have been sharing my dumb stories ages ago.",tifu
TIFU (UPDATE!!) deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.,"Amidst the hate and questioning of my sexuality, there was actually some fantastic advice in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5toeo/tifu_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my_new/). I came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what I was going to say. I felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer I got, the more fucking petrified I became. The walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if I was in there first, and maybe if I was first it would seem more intimidating. My mind was going nuts. I got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. Just a fucking horrible way to start this.

&#x200B;

Then, I proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. I honestly wish I could tell you all exactly what I said but I really don't remember. I know I apologized, I said something along the lines of each of us probably don't want to ever have to look at each other again, and I did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, I'd be happy to help her find another job. She asked if I wanted her to leave and I said of course not.

&#x200B;

She was kind of looking down the whole time and after I finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said ""what are the fucking odds."" We both started laughing and I came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. We agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, Ugh.

&#x200B;

I got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. Then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. Ohhh boy, lol, but sure.

* When did i learn i could do this?
* Have i ever done this for a crowd before?

and of course...

* Does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?

and..

* Are you bi? Do you think it's kind of gay?

&#x200B;

I obliged, I think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.

&#x200B;

I asked her how long she has known my friend for. (They met in college). She said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. She said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. I got the feeling this wasn't the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.

&#x200B;

I really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but I was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters I don't think I want to know the answer.

&#x200B;

So there you have it.

&#x200B;

Oh and no, I do not know if she's on Reddit. I felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.

&#x200B;

tl:dr - I did my best, she did hers, it's awkward but it'll all be okay.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Okay, I'll answer the questions.

I learned with my girlfriend in college.  We were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  It's been a party trick of mine, lol, since.

&#x200B;

Never done it for a crowd before, no.

&#x200B;

(from the original post)

Since everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts. No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward. By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

&#x200B;

As for the ""I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - I bring it back to the above statement. A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off. Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. Better than jerking off that's for sure.

Little sister (16) needs an abortion. Texas wants parental consent which we can't get. Can I take her to New Mexico? (UPDATE: it's done),"https://redd.it/6m79kf

So it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.

I told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.

She was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

Thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",legaladvice

Got robbed at Walmart by someone who I think is my coworker but management says it isn't and implied my job is in jeopardy,"Posted this on /r/walmart and was suggested to put it here as well.  

Tried posting as a throwaway but guess it was too new, and wouldn't show up. This is a side account I randomly created years ago.

I am an autistic special needs janitor at a wal mart in PA.   
The other day as I was going to my car (I was off) just buying some food. A coworker calls me by my name outside the front doors. He starts talking to me and walks to my car with me. He said he wants to ask me a question and opens my car and gets in.

At this point he starts freaking out that he needs money and makes me give him all the money in my wallet, and then tried to get me to drive to a gas station to use my debit card. Now I am tiny, autistic, with bad motor skills from a head injury. He is the 2nd biggest person that works in the store. I would of been no match if he tried anything.

In the car he demanded my phone number so he contact me later. He called the number I gave to make sure it was the correct number. Thus me at this point acquiring his number.

The next day before work I receive 5 missed calls in a half hour from his number, telling me to meet him in private. I go file a report with the police and give them all the info, investigator said he would call the number I gave him to get him to stop harassing me as well.

When I got to work I file a report with management with the same info and they promise they would investigate ASAP!

Fast forward the investigator gets back to me and said a girl picked up the phone and he asked to speak my coworker and they said okay and put him on the phone. He responded to all the cops questions as the name I gave admitting he took the money but would give it back. The investigator also tells me no charges can be filed cause I handed the money over in fear and not it being snatched out of my own hands. I have been advised to appeal that to the state police btw.

Management talked to me today and an assistant who is not AP said he did the investigation and determined it was not who I said it but someone who looked exactly almost 100% like the person who I accused. Who happened to know my name, and who happened to respond to my coworkers name. They wont show me the footage. Also they casually decided to inform me I got followed by a car he got in after he got out of my car.

Now the manager is implying my job could be in jeopardy for wrongly accusing a person who even he said looked exactly like the person I said it was

[UPDATE] Does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? Oregon,"Previous post a month ago [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9g6uwn/does_a_child_who_didnt_see_one_parent_because_the/).

I'm safe, and I'm out.

I organised a place to stay with a coworker. I have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. My dad has some regular sport meetings on Saturdays that go for hours so I prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. I've been approved for a rental and I move there soon.

I contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when I told them he'd been telling me I couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

I took copies of all of his paperwork too because while I was getting ready to move I found most of what I knew about my parents separating was a lie. There was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. My dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when I was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. He's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when I'm 21. Some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. I think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. I did not find the letter I read when I was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

After I moved out my dad did try to contact the police. They came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say I couldn't look after myself. His words were that I was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

I've been back to Canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. We're still working out the details with a Canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but I have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people I remember. They were really worried about me when I went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

AITA for ditching my date and causing a scene?,"I'm 19F and my date was 25M, I was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while I was half way through my session. 

I get an IG message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would've found me since my page is super private, my username isn't specific at all to my real name and I have 40 followers. 
He explains he's so and so's friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it's hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so I'm excited and we plan to meet up. 

We catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, I take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We're in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

I study justice so he's telling me how he's an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that's when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.
He keeps asking if anyone knows I'm with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.

I hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn't DUI, he didn't want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

I get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he's taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene ""I'm really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me"" they catch on and can see I'm upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he'll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks ""who does your mum think your with?"" The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

I felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he'd taken the time to see me, I'm not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could've stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn't have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would've been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

[UPDATE] I [29M] found my girlfriend [32F] has a soft strap-on dildo that she's been hiding from me. I think she knows I found it. What do I do?,"Last post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu9h99/i_29m_found_my_girlfriend_32f_has_a_soft_strapon/

A lot went down in the last few hours. Less dick jokes this time round, because now I'm over the ""surprise floppy dong!"" aspect of it, it's turned out a lot more serious than I expected.

(for what it's worth, my girlfriend told me to still call her ""she"" at all times except when dressing male, so I'm still going with that for this update post)

I fell asleep not long after the post I made last night. Got up around 2. Headed downstairs to get my 2pm ""breakfast"", and GF was down there in her pyjamas, with a cup of tea and her phone. Good a time as any to address the elephant in the room, I thought.

It was awkward as hell. I started off with ""hey"", got a dead silence, and followed it up with something like ""sorry, I was looking for my uniform shirt yesterday, but that drawer's really none of my business, you can keep whatever you want in there, it's all good"".

Tried to keep it as non-specific as I could. If she didn't know I'd found it before, she definitely knew now.

She just sort of nodded in response to me. Then she apologised for not being in a talkative mood last night, and started telling me about her day. But it came off really strained. I could tell it was on her mind, and she kinda trailed off after a bit.

Eventually she told me to come upstairs with her. I thought she just wanted to talk somewhere more private (it's a shared kitchen, we're living in a family's spare room). But no, she went into our room and showed me everything.

She crossdresses. That's specifically how she referred to it, not trans or drag king or anything. She wears the dick (the packer, as the comments informed me last night), and the crop top she'd had it wrapped in flattens down her boobs. And it turns out she's been going through my drawers for a lot longer than I've been going through hers, because she got a shirt and some comfy tracksuit pants from my drawers and put them on. She has long hair, so she ties it up and hides it under a flat cap that she had in another drawer.

After she'd shown me all of this, basically in silence, she looked at herself in her mirror for a bit. Different angles and stuff. To me she still basically looked like herself, with a flatter chest and different clothes, but she seemed fascinated with how she looked now.

She kept glancing over at me to see my approval, and I smiled back. Tried to look as reassuring as possible. I noticed she'd been pretty shaky putting things on. When she was looking at herself in the mirror, I went over and put a hand on her shoulder supportively, which basically seemed like it was what pushed her over into starting to cry.

Then she broke the silence and just couldn't stop talking. She's been crossdressing secretly for the past couple of months, she was so worried about what I'd think. She insists she's not transgender, she just likes to crossdress sometimes, it makes her feel good and confident. Also insists it's not a sex thing. Just for fun.

I kept saying ""it's okay, it's okay, don't worry"", mostly because I didn't really know what to say. I ended up hugging her as she sobbed on the bed. She calmed down eventually, and told me ""thank you"", because she said she had no idea how I'd react.

She asked me how she looked (while still all red-eyed from crying). I just said ""you look great"" and smiled, and she hugged me again. ""You don't mind me wearing your clothes?"" ""Yeah, no worries!"" I guess she was always a lot more careful with my stuff than I was with hers in my rush yesterday. We didn't really talk much about it, I just asked a few simple questions like if she wanted me to refer to her with different pronouns when she was dressed like this (I know that's usually a trans thing but I thought I'd check anyway).

We didn't do much else after that. She eventually got on her phone again, I got on my laptop. The two of us hanging out together doing our own thing, just as we usually do, only with her in different clothes. I basically got my mind off it for a bit, and then I had to go to work again not long later. Wrote most of this on the bus to work.

I've been thinking back to when I said she looked great. She basically just looked like herself still. A few different clothing choices didn't transform her into a different person for me, and they definitely didn't transform her into a man. It was basically just the same as she always is, for me. But I realise it was a lot more significant for her, and I respect that. But also I don't want to pretend it's a mindblowing shift in appearance for me, too.

Also I was thinking... I think I'm glad she's not trans. Is that bad of me to say? I love and respect her but I realised when thinking about it last night, if I ever did see her as a man, things would be really different for me. I know I was going on about pegging in the last post, but ""girl with strapon"" and ""someone who straight-up looks like a man"" are really two different things for me, and I don't think I really have the wiring to have feelings for her as a man. But I'd do my best to be supportive anyway, because I don't want to stop her being the person she is. I'm really hoping the situation stays where it is and never comes between us. If it did... I'd have to let go of her as a girlfriend. Let her find somebody right for her.

TL;DR: I don't have a problem with her crossdressing, but mainly because she still just looks like a woman to me and I barely even register it as crossdressing. Should I tell her this? I think she'd take it badly after the emotional moments earlier.

I have to go into work now, so I won't be responding for a bit. Thank you for everyone who's offered support, in public or private.",relationship_advice

TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.,"Obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

I had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! Or so I thought. 

About 3 weeks after our proposal, I notice she starts acting different. Not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. She had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of M-F each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. I went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when I have work the next day, so I often opted out.

We would also share our google location with each other at all times. Mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and I would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. I looked at her location one day and it was turned off. I texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. Hadn't been a problem for the past year. She turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. She also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. I only had the location for the personal phone. Eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

Two days ago, about a month after the proposal, I decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and I just wanted to put it to rest. I used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. She had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. I called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. She said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

I waited until she got home and confronted her about it. She said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought I would get mad. Turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. I kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time I asked.

The next day when I got home from work, I asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. She said she deleted them. So I said I wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. I started recovering the data from the last backup. She sat down beside me while I was doing it, and asked what I was doing. I told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! So she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. I asked her one last time, ""before I look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" She was silent. I asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. Turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. Funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. So that's a win I guess.

Planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. Havn't told her yet. Still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. Feels shitty but I'm keeping my head up.

TLDR; TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. It has been one month since the proposal now.

We're polar opposites. I've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. My sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. She tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. 

Recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. She currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. Problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.

On the other hand, I'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. Naturally, my parents think I should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. They say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but I'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.

I shut down the idea immediately. In my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. My GF and I plan on getting married soon and I don't want to waste money on my sister's education.

I don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

I received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. I was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. His mood has been pretty touch and go lately so I was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and I thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

I basically said I know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because I haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. I absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. I stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? You want me to get rid of him?""

I ***EXPLICITLY*** said ""No I would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. This is where shit started to hit the fan. He said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that I was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if I was fucking sick in the head.

I fucked up here. I shouldn't have said this but I don't handle confrontation well and I pretty much lost my cool at this point. I told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. He completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (I agree) and started calling me a number of names. He then started to get extremely personal saying I never cared about his little brother and that I'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

That is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. I still cant bellieve it and I don't think I'm ever going to forgive hm for that. Like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. He knows exactly how I feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? He can seriously go fuck himself because I'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

He then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes I know I'm basically killing his brother all over again??? I was crying so much at this point I didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. I have no idea where he's gone or where he is and I honestly don't even know if I care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

I still can't believe he reacted the way he did. He was like a completely different person. Not once in the four years I've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. I was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as I was.

THEN this fucking morning I get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for FORCING HIM TO REMOVE THE TATTOO. Apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them I've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

WHAT THE FUCK?!?! I EXPLICITLY TOLD HIM I WOULD NEVER ASK HIM TO DO THAT. When I told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. Feckin lovely.

I seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. I'm still in total shock and just so confused. I hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. I don't see what I could have done differently? I shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

I'm just at a complete loss right now. A day ago I thought of this guy as my future husband and now I just don't know. I wish I never said anything.

I've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him I've never seen before. Im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. How the fuk would we even move froward from this? Am I the one in the wrong here for the comment I made? I know I shouldn't have said it but I personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am I supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? Anything I sy is just going to sound like I'm lying in response to their negative reactions. I seriously have no idea what Im supposed to do here. I feel like this is going to ruin my life.

I just don't fucking know.

It's been 12 years, and Z has since come out as MtF transgender. She messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. We went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. It was along the lines of, ""I'm sorry for being mean. I was young, and I was struggling with my gender identity.""

I thanked her for her apology. When she asked if she was forgiven, and I tried to avoid answering. I am still not over what she did to me. What Z did to me impacted me greatly, as I was a impressionable young girl. I struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

Z started getting defensive. She told me that I was being petty and that I should forgive her. I told her, ""Why? You will always be the boy that bullied me.  An apology won't change that."" She got really offended when I said the word boy, and said that I was misgendering her. She called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

"LPT: When at the beach, always beware the area where the waves don't crash.

The most important thing to keep in mind is to **not try to fight back against the current**, **swim sidewides to break out of it**. Rip currents are not always like the areas mentionned in the title. Also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the subject, please read about it on specialised websites.

People often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. However the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

It is way easier to see with [an image](http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). If you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

AITA for skipping my own wedding to see my dying grandma?,"This actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and I honestly don't think I'm in the wrong, I figured I'd ask for an outside opinion.

My girlfriend (then fiancée) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

Now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that I've never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real ""mother""  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

About a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn't have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer's help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

Fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma's condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

She doesn't pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fiancée multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she's my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.

My fiancée was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won't even know I'm there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn't matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. 

She ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fiancée didn't talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fiancée she should take top priority no matter what. My opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

So yeah that's the back story. We have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. Will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my GF.",AmItheAsshole
I [m32] matched with my wife [f29] on Tinder...,"Big time throwaway account.

I'll start by saying that my wife and I don't have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

We met on Tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. We've been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, I would say.

A month ago she left on a business trip for a week and I found myself downloading Tinder on a particularly lonely night. I don't even know why. I didn't have any intentions. But I did it.

I swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. It was a funny reminder of that time of my life. I deleted it and moved on.

On Monday my wife left for another business trip. Last night I once again downloaded Tinder and started swiping. Again, I had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

Then I saw her picture come up.

I say shocked for a moment. I wondered if I should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. I thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... But I read her profile... it's her. It's her now and it's her live. There's even a picture of her where I am cut out.

I decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

I swiped and we matched.

She gets back from her business trip tomorrow. I'm going to confront her then. I don't even know how this is happening. She's over 100 miles. Is a friend of her using her account??

Now I have to explain why I was on Tinder. This is just a huge can of worms that got opened.

Caught my (m34) wife (f30) cheating on me and she is furious with me,"A week ago my wife said she was going out with univesity friends after some volunteer shifts that she does. She said she would be home late and not to worry, after 11pm she said she was going to stay at her friends house and go to work from there in the morning. This is very unusual so I started calling and messaging like crazy hoping that she could just take a taxi back. She refused to pick up the phone and told me not to worry. 

She continued to refuse and was obviously v drunk so I became worried and very suspicious. Not proud of it but I went into her emails and checked the rota for her volunteer work and sure enough she wasn't on it. This led me to check her Internet history and I found a whole heap of searches clearly indicating an affair.

I went to work that morning and she still wasn't back so I confronted her when I got home that evening. She admitted the searches and said they were just her fantasies and that she had been at an 80s night and nothing had happened. When I told her she hadn't stayed with at her friends she admitted that too but said she had been at the club all night and came straight home. Obvious lies as she was looking at hotels online and from card payments from our joint account I can see was not in a place that does 80s nights.

So I'm not an idiot and it's 100% clear what has happened but she will not admit it and becomes really angry with me when I bring it up. She says constantly that she stayed out and made the searches because I have never paid her enough attention and she needed more intimacy from me. 

I'm losing my mind because I still want to fix this but can't even proceed to the first step of accepting the situation (let alone forgiving her) as she wont admit what is obvious. Shes so angry with me and has recently told me she is scared of me now because I was so angry the evening after she was out all night. She doesn't look remotely sorry for how she has acted and now when I bring up the night she simply says I told you everything I'm not gonna talk about it. This,  even though her story is provably false.

I feel like I'm purgatory now. Together for 10 years and I don't even know this person.

I need to know is this kind of behaviour typical for someone who has been having an affair? 

If so are there ways I can get her to admit what she has done, or at least be willing to answer my questions in a believable way?

Is there a way I can move forward because everything I do is hitting a wall.",relationship_advice

"UPDATE: Hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. Building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (TO, Canada)","Link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

First I want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and I are quite happy with. I've been very active on Reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. It has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. I digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

Through the advice I received on this subreddit, I contacted the city and the health department right away. I was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. The more we spoke the more interested he became. He called and asked me ""if I were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would I be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" To which I replied ""150%"". He then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, I said ""no."" 

Shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. I went out and asked them why. They told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. I told them they were to leave it there as I have called the city and they are on their way. They didn't seem happy. As if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. Literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. I also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. I have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. This lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

I explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. According to Toronto Health and Bylaws that is bullshit. The situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. The bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information I have been receiving from the building management. 

The bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. I heard nothing until Monday. Come Monday morning I get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that Wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. They will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. The cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. I'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

The city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. I do not believe them at all. We have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. From what I understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. Now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. I have the personal contact information for the officer I spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. We went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

Thank you so much Reddit!!! I couldn't have done it without your help!!

TIFU by ejaculating in my bed,"Throwaway obviously. This is a few months old but I feel like I have to get it out of my head.

So I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I've always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

After some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

I didn't notice at first and since I've never had cockroaches before I didn't really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.



I don't know why but it felt like murder. I didn't really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



Then my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school. 



So we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn't tell them why. They thought I just didn't like the Airbnb.

"[Manitoba, CANADA] (UPDATE) My cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.","Previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

My cousin and I want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. He couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. Thank you so much! This situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

Now for the update: My cousin is moving out this weekend. He spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. Also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. The landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. My cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. Needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. After an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. The landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

Anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for June, July, and August, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. My cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. Luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. He is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with James ever again.

While my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. He was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. My cousin and I honestly feel bad for James as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. Still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

And that is it. Thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. Take care, you beautiful people.

EDIT: Since I'm getting nasty messages, I figured I should edit this to let everyone know that I have finally convinced my cousin to report him. He will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is Saturday. We are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. Also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of June 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

There you go folks. Please stop insulting my cousin and I.",legaladvice

I [M 26] am getting married soon. Need advice on keeping stalker[F 25] away,"Hello,

Using throwaway because family knows my username.

&#x200B;

So back in 2017 I had met a girl on Tinder. We texted for two months before we met. We had told each other we weren't looking for serious relationships (which is kinda why I agreed to meet her in the first place - I was not in a frame of mind to get into a relationship.). Hooked up the first time we met. Following day she told me she was in love with me and asked if we could date, to which I said no. 

Long drawn fights, a lot of gaslighting, manipulation, crying followed in the subsequent weeks over texts (which I documented) and calls (which I recorded). She told me she was depressed, suffered child abuse, was sexually assaulted and that's the source of her rage. She started threatening me with suicide. I caved and continued to talk to her on a condition that she remains platonic. We did not meet in person, but she sent me > 50 texts daily and would call every alternate day. I played along, thinking she will lose interest soon but that did not happen. She asked three more times if we could get into a relationship and three times I said no. Of course, the logical inconsistency with her saying she will keep it platonic and asking for a relationship went unnoticed because I was just too chicken, too scared, to say anything, thinking she might hurt herself.

After a while this started to affect me and work started to suffer. I tried to distance myself from her. After about 4 months after meeting her, she asked me to meet her again as a birthday present. I refused. She lashed out at me. I told her the ""friendship"" was not going to work this was and I changed my phone number, deleted all my social media and alerted friends. She then contacted a handful of my friends (who she probably figured out from social media), colleagues and started a smear campaign. She also made suicide threats, but did not receive any detectable response. She then showed up at my workplace, and a colleague sent her back telling her that I have quit. I passed on a message through one of the colleagues she called, saying I want no further contact. She keeps listening to some music I upload  - spends hours at times - which is how I know she hasn't completely forgotten me yet. However, last she tried to contact me directly was over a year ago.  

I subsequently found out I am not the first person she did this to. One of the previous victims even works for the same employer as I! There have been at least 4 guys she has done the same thing to.

\[Clearly I am skipping details, but I don't believe these are important\]

I am a guy in India, so there is no provision for me to complain against her - the law thinks Indian men cannot get stalked and harassed. So legal action is not possible. She lives in the same city.

I met a wonderful person by end of 2018 and we got engaged recently. We are getting married soon. What all precautions should I be taking?

Update to my (20F) boyfriend (21M) Hates my vagina with a passion,"First post. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c82g4x/my_boyfriend_21m_hates_my_20f_vagina_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Here's a quick update. You guys all really hyped me up so thanks for the thousands of pep talks, I wouldn't have been able to muster up the courage on my own. So I told him that I didn't enjoy sex. I could tell by his face that he already knew it wasn't fun for me and he was frustrated I brought it up. 

basicallyyyy I asked him to please do something for me for once or I can't do it anymore. I don't like giving ultimatums or being confrontational like that especially knowing he is in a tough spot. But He agreed to touch me over my underwear but he was very obviously trying to distract himself when I was getting wet by kissing me. He was upset afterwards and locked himself in the bathroom. I couldn't help but cry like it felt so fucked up, how does he get me off and then go hide in the bathroom. and he heard me so he came out and I said I hated him. Not the most constructive thing to say but I couldn't help it. He said he couldn't do that again and offered opening up the relationship so I could have sex with other guys and get oral from them. 

I do NOT want to be in a polygamous relationships. I am a strictly monogamous type of girl. I don't want 2 boyfriends. So I told him that wasn't an option and he just shrugged. I asked him if he was gay and he said no. I asked if he was sure or if he had a traumatic experience or if he's trying to get out of doing the work. he told me we can break up if I want since he wouldn't answer my questions. And when I told him ok it's over, he started crying and I asked him to please tell me what was wrong and he said no. 

Basically we broke up. I wanna help him and figure out what's wrong but he doesn't wanna open up so there. I didn't think he'd get emotional but yeah",relationship_advice

TIFU by being oblivious to the notes my fiancée has been writing me.,"Obligatory ""It's 7 AM. This didn't happen today, but very recently."" I have been packing a lunch for work for about the past two months. I pack it usually, but if I'm behind schedule, my fiancée will sometimes help or do it for me.

I got home from work, and we were talking about how the day went. She asked me how lunch was, and I told her it was good and thanked her again. After a pause, she kinda laughed and said ""Did you like the note today?!""

Puzzled, I told her I didn't know what she was talking about. She said ""The note. The one I put it your lunch today."" I told her I didn't see a note. But the way she said ""today"" made it feel like this wasn't the first time. I said ""Wait. Have you written me a note before?""

She said ""Yes. Have you never seen them?"" So apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and I've thrown every one in the trashcan at work.

&#x200B;

The same thing happened a second time the day after I posted that, so I went along with the suggestion of filming myself while I sleep, and did that starting just over a week ago whenever I napped during the day/evening.

&#x200B;

Long story short it clearly is my brother, I've got him doing it on film twice and thats without even filming myself at night. I have no idea how to even start to talk to him about this, or if I should just stay quiet and try to sleep less until we're back to separate bedrooms.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didnt expect so much advice! I'm going to read everything. And for those asking, my brother's a year younger than me. So I'm quite worried about having the video at all for the reasons some people pointed out.

&#x200B;

2nd Edit: I want to thank everyone for giving advice, even if a lot of people seem to be arguing about what's best and how serious it is etc. Some very calm sounding people have suggested I speak to my brother before anything else, so I'm going to do that. I know some others have warned not to do this, but I think its important to speak to him first. If it goes badly with him then I can still speak to my parents or someone else, but if I speak to them first I can't undo it.

I'm still getting comments and private messages asking a lot of the same stuff, so - I'm 14, he's 13. As for why I 'let him do it a second time', well I do still have to sleep, and I kept recording myself until I made this post and people pointed out why it might be such a bad idea. Also a lot of people asking how I know what semen smells like. How do you think? Calm down and stop calling me names.",relationship_advice

"If your are ""literally shaking"" from the recent national tragedies, but you have no direct affiliation with the victims, you need to get over yourself.","I have seen a few overly dramatic people on Twitter and Reddit going on about how they are ""literally shaking"" from the recent spree of mass shooting attacks.

While those attacks are worth a long in depth civil discussion by itself, if you aren't directly affiliated with the victims, you need to get a grip with yourself and stop making everything about you.

Like you are taking national tragedies, and making it about yourself. If it bothers you that much, get off your ass and speak to your local lawmakers.

It just really annoys the shit out of me. Like I may like guns, BUT at least I respect anyone calling for action against guns. That's action. You're voicing a stance, and that's good. 

You saying ""omg, I'm literally shaking"" is just fucking worthless reaction to tell anyone. 

Get a grip.

Edit: So far I have been DMed and called a ""cunt"" and a ""dumpster faggot""
Very classy. You're mad about me saying anything about these attacks, but you realize the recent Orlando attack was a gay nightclub, right? Is that irony lost on you when calling me a ""faggot""? 

Otherwise, thank you for the mostly civil discussion, even if you really disagree with me. Only a few people grossly misunderstood me. I also do have empathy for innocent people getting slaughtered minding their own business, but I don't have room for people seeking attention over something that has little to do with them.

Also shoutout to those people dropping peer reviewed statistics on all of this.

Also, hypothetically speaking, what if I was a nutbar with no empathy and ready to go off. Wouldn't harassing me with nasty messages just confirm my delusional bias with society at large?

Update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. I'm back after 6 months.,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",legaladvice
AITA For saying no when a child I didn't know asked if she could play with my sons bike.,"This is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and I'm fed up of being called an asshole so I'm going to ask on here. 

We are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. 

My son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. He had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

When we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blasé attitude towards belongings and she's lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn't attached to material things.

I interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl 'why don't you ask (my son) since it's his bike?' She did and my son said no. She looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn't seem bothered afterwards. 

My entire family looked at my like I was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. 

I got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and I was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son 'honey, sometimes it's nice to share' because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it's his new toy and he shouldn't be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

AITA for telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a SAHM I am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore?,"My wife and I have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. Wife hasn't been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. 

At my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot — it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there's that. The pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. My wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a SAHM which is what she's wanted. 

The issue is that my wife and I aren't on the same page about what this change would mean. Before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. We also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (Plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). 

I told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. These cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and I also think it's practical.  She was mostly agreeable to that. But then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. 

I told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

She looked at me like I was some sort of Neanderthal but I think what I'm saying is completely fair. I'm not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. Just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it's fair that if I'm the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don't come home to more stress and chaos. 

Obviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves. I'm mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base.

The week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. Wasn't expecting it but I'm cool with it. Again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. A decision I would live to regret. She doesn't text me the entire night. Weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

The next day I receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. Meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. A little more conversation and we're over. She's completely cut me out of her life. I check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. I've heard from her friends that they're dating now.

Open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined.

EDIT: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't MEAN that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. Either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

I am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

[Chicago] I was robbed by my AirBnB host. Looking for legal advice.,"This all took place over the past weekend (Friday/Saturday, June 14-15) in Chicago.  I already filed a police report, as well as brought this to the attention of AirBnB both over the phone and on Twitter.

Unlike my posts about this incident elsewhere, I'll be as thorough in explaining the situation here as to get the most relevant advice possible.  I apologize in advance for the essay, but please read all of of it if you want to give advice, to make sure you get the whole story.

I was in Chicago for the weekend for Pokémon Go Fest - for those unfamiliar, it's an all-day paid event hosted at a park, this year it was at Grant Park.  My ticket date was for Friday the 14th.

Earlier that week (Monday I think?) I went on Airbnb to look for affordable options.  By this point, all the hotels in the area were close to $300 a night, and most Airbnb's within a mile or two of Grant Park were either already booked or also that expensive.  I found what looked to be a good deal south of downtown for around $85 a night.  The host had mostly positive reviews, with the only negative review saying that he felt the price was too high for a single bed.  Fine, nothing to really be concerned about there.  People said the host was nice, that he made them breakfast, really no reason to think there was anything fishy going on.

I requested Thursday through Sunday (checkout on Sunday) through Airbnb, and the host accepted my request later that day.  I put in the comments (where it says to tell the host about yourself, and they encourage you to share why you are traveling) that I was in town for Pokémon Go Fest and would be gone most of the day, and just needed a place to sleep at night.  Arrived in Chicago, went to meet my host Thursday evening.  The Uber driver warned me that it wasn't the best place for an Airbnb and that it was one of the unsafer neighborhoods in Chicago.  Well OK, nice to know, but I really didn't have any options at this point.

Messaged the host that I was there, he came out to meet me and show me up to the room.  I took all of my belongings with me (I had a laptop worth about $2000, a suitcase with my Nintendo Switch among other things, phone chargers, clothes, medication), and said I would be back later, that I wanted to go get some dinner.  I asked him if there was a key for the place he could give me (as that's usually what Airbnb hosts have done at past trips I've taken, even if it *is* just for a single room and not the entire place), and he said he doesn't have a spare key, but to just message him when I need to be let in and he'll come open the door.  Again, he seemed friendly so I didn't think anything of it, and said I would be back later.

I got back, messaged him to let me in, and he came to open the door.  I went to bed, didn't talk to the guy at all.  He had the TV on all night, or at least until I fell asleep, I was lying in bed at 1:30am hearing his TV.

Next morning (Friday), I got up, showered, took my medication and left.  After all, that was the day of Go Fest, where I would be busy in the park from 9am-7pm.  The host knew this, I told him in my initial request to book that I would be gone all day.

So here I am in Grant Park at about 9:30, after just getting started with my day, when I got a message from Airbnb support.  They told me ""your host is no longer able to accommodate you, let me know when I can call and discuss this with you.""   Already pretty pissed off at this point as I was trying to enjoy my day, but I told them go ahead and call whenever.  I got a call from a ""resolution manager"" maybe 15 minutes after I sent that message, and the lady explained that, for whatever reason, the host was no longer able to host me and that, as compensation, they would give me a $200 voucher and give me links to other listings in the area.  Great, I said, but what about all of my stuff?  I'm *busy all day*, I can't just go get my suitcase and laptop, having nowhere to take the stuff, nor can I check into some Airbnb at 9:30 in the morning.  The lady said she'd check, and call me back.  She called back another 10-15 minutes later and said ""I talked to your host, he said he would be there all day so you can get your things when it's convenient."" I said great, then I won't leave the park and just go get my things after 7pm when the event is done.  I asked the lady if he gave a reason for cancelling my trip (at this time, I was too preoccupied to even ask *if he had a right to do this*, I just went along with it), and she said that he said something about ""not liking the communication"", whatever that means.  Um, okay.

Fast-forward to 12:30pm.  Host messages me through Airbnb (note that, the entire weekend I hadn't ever talked to the host outside of Airbnb - I had his number and he had mine, but I didn't receive any text messages from him or any calls, and I didn't message/call him either.  Given that the whole ""I don't have a key for you"" was already sketchy enough, I wanted all of my communications with him to be logged through Airbnb so their staff could see it in case of incident.) saying ""Your checkout time was noon and you didn't come to get your stuff.  I'm going to put it under the stairs."" I wrote back saying that Airbnb support told me you would be home all day, what are you talking about? My checkout time was noon *ON SUNDAY*, not in the middle of the day on Friday!  If he wanted to cut my trip short, that was on him, but he's not going to inconvenience me like this.  (okay, I didn't say all of that to him, just the first part about what support told me).  He wrote back saying ""I don't know what you two talked about but I definitely will not be home all day, I suggest you come get your stuff.""

Well, considering that the front door to the building locks, I figured my stuff was safe under the stairs, only tenants of that building would be getting in anyway, and if he wasn't home later I could probably ask one of the other tenants to open the door for me.

So around 6pm when I had a bit of a break, I looked for another Airbnb.  Found something much closer that cost more money, since they were giving me a $200 voucher after all - tried to book one, but the voucher wasn't working.  I called them and they said they'd ""look into it"", and I basically said look, I'm running out of time, just give me $200 back to my credit card and I'll get a hotel, I'm done dealing with you guys.  They agreed, under the condition that I gave them the hotel receipt.  So I booked a hotel.

Fast-forward to Friday night around 8:30pm.  Finished Go Fest, ate dinner, got an Uber over to the place.  I actually told the Uber driver I was going to get my stuff, and then need a ride to the hotel, he said he can just add a destination to our trip, and agreed to wait while I got my stuff.  The front door to the complex was locked, but the night before it had opened after I jiggled the knob a few times.  I'm standing there jiggling the knob and trying to push the door in when some lady gets out of her car with a young child.  She sees the Uber driver parked there watching me, asks him what's going on, he explains to her that he's waiting on me, etc etc.  This lady's naturally a bit spooked, as she sees some strange guy trying to, what looks like, break into her apartment building while someone in a car is waiting for them.  Definitely seems sketchy from her perspective.  I explain the situation to her and she's shocked that anyone would rent an Airbnb in that building, but she agrees to open the door for me.  I get in, look under the stairs, and my luggage isn't there.  Wanting answers immediately, I attempt to actually call my (former) host.  He doesn't answer.  She said she'd try to call since she lives across from him, I gave her the number - she calls, gets his voicemail, leaves a message.  Oh, and meanwhile the Uber driver alerted me that someone else was added to his queue so he has to leave.  I say thanks for the ride and that I'll book another when I'm ready.  Now I'm by myself. 
 While we're waiting for a call back, I walk up to her apartment (which is directly across from his) - as she handed me a couple gallons of milk to carry for her while she unlocked the door for me.  I set the milk down in her apartment and, just for the heck of it, I open the Tile app on my phone.

Before I continue my story, let me explain real quickly what Tile is and what it does.  Tile is a small tracking device that you can attach to objects that you think you might misplace - in my case, my car keys and wallet.  I have one in my wallet and one on my key ring.  If your phone is within Bluetooth range of these devices, you can make them play music to help you find the device - and if you ever lose it, the app will tell you where it's last seen.

So, anyway - much to my surprise, the Tile app tells me *that my keyring is in range right now*!  Literally, as I'm standing outside the guy's apartment that I can't get into, my car keys (which were in my luggage) are within a few hundred feet of my phone!  The guy calls her back and says ""look, I told the guest this too, I put his stuff under the stairs, if it's gone then someone probably stole it and it's his fault for not coming and getting it when I told him to."" She relays the message to me, but I say no... that's not true, the stuff is here *right now*, and I show her my phone.  She tells him this, and I hear loud yelling over the phone.  He starts cussing her out, saying it's none of her [expletive] business, and hangs up.  Okay, now I'm starting to get the picture.  He probably saw this as a great opportunity - I said in my notes that I would be gone all day for an event, he sees that I have valuable items, what a great idea!  He can end my stay early, *know I can't get my stuff because I'm gone at an event*, CLAIM he put it out for me and ""oh, it's gone, someone must have stolen it"".  Meanwhile, he pockets all this valuable loot that he can do whatever with.  Except... he wasn't planning on me being able to prove that my belongings were in his apartment that night when he wasn't home.  As soon as she tells him this, he flips out, realizing I'm onto him.  The lady calls the landlord.  Landlord comes out, I explain this all to him.  He advises me to file a police report.  Says that even though he has the key and *can* let me enter his apartment, he doesn't have the legal right to do so, and that the tenant (my Airbnb host) could try to sue *him* for illegal entry.  The landlord also puts a notice on the guy's door, saying he's going to evict him, that it's totally against his lease to let guests stay there.  He was appalled that the place was even listed on Airbnb.

We called the police, waited about half an hour for them to show up, making small talk in the meantime.  He told me he was gonna evict the guy soon anyway because of how shady he is, and that this whole Airbnb thing suddenly makes sense, because the guy was always late paying the rent and kept coming up short, but that mysteriously a couple months ago he was able to pay it (after the landlord threatened to evict).  I keep telling the guy, look, that's all well and dandy but I just want my stuff back.  I do understand where he's coming from, and that's why I was glad to wait for the police.  If police can write up a warrant and let me in, great!  But after about half an hour of waiting, he said ""let's just go down to the station"" so he drives me there.

I run this by them, the cops basically say they can't issue a warrant off of that alone and that I have to attempt to get my stuff back directly from the person first, then I can file a report if he doesn't comply, *then* they can do something.  So the landlord tells me - the guy's usually home Saturday mornings.  Call him, call the police, they'll go up together and see what they can do.

So I'm staying completely empty handed at a hotel Friday night, hoping I can resolve this matter in the morning.

Saturday morning comes, I do exactly as instructed.  Call landlord, call police.  Police escorts come out, landlord comes out a bit later.  I call the host, who of course does not answer, so landlord gets his spare key and we start walking up to the place - me, landlord, and an officer.  Knock on the door, no reply.  Police knocks and says they're the cops, here with landlord and guest, the man opens the door ajar (leaving it chained so they couldn't force entry), starts filming and making this whole spiel about illegal entry and how they're infringing his rights.  He says to me ""I messaged you lots of times and you ignored me"", I say no you didn't, I don't have a single text from you and only the one message from Airbnb and he says ""that's bulls*** and you know it"".  I say fine, show me your phone then where you sent me texts, and of course he refuses because that's not true at all.  The cop basically says look, at this point you tried, but you'll have to file a report for stolen belongings, we can't break into this guy's place.  Meanwhile, I'm checking my phone while standing in front of his apartment like the night before, and the Tile shows it's no longer there.  Says it was last seen 10:30pm Friday night (when we left to wait on the cops).

So, the guy moved my stuff elsewhere after realizing we were onto him, also took the notice off his door.  The landlord gave me all the information I needed to file my police report, and asked if he could see the Airbnb listing just to see what I even agreed to with the guy.

Would it shock anyone at this point when I learned that he used a fake name on Airbnb?  The name I had for him wasn't even his real name.  Huge surprise. /s

So anyway, I give the officer all this info, they write up a report.  I give them the itemized list of what was stolen, they estimate it at around $3000 (I actually forgot to tell them about my Switch at this point), give me a ""victim notice"" and say an investigator will follow up with me in a week or so.  Well, great, I won't even be there in a week, and he can easily sell my stuff before any of those serials I gave the cops get registered anywhere!

I called Airbnb about this.  I said first of all, I didn't think hosts could just cancel a stay like that and kick a guest out.  They said ""they can't..."" and the guy on the phone said ""your stay wasn't cancelled at all, it shows a confirmed reservation from June 13-14 with you checking out on the 14th at noon."" I said NO, that's not it, look at my original confirmation.  He checks and says ""oh, huh, I see that now."" Digs into it and apparently some supervisor overrode something that should not have been overridden, as it shows in the Airbnb app that I consented to the altered stay (I did not, and was simply *told*).  I don't know what lies he told the Airbnb support people, but they somehow got their managers to override this and alter my trip to say I was checking out on the 14th instead of the 16th.

So at this point I'm considering my goods lost, and I called Airbnb again and asked if there was any way they can take money from the guy (after all, if they deposit money into his bank account when people book stays with him, they can take it out too...) to reimburse me the $3000 he stole from me.  They said ""you can do that, but you have to fill out a request"" and they sent me a link.  The link only lets me request $87 back (one nights' stay, the other two were auto-refunded when the trip was altered).  I explain this to them, and they said ""just request the $87 back, the guy's not going to do it anyway, then after 72 hours you can escalate it to our claims division and they can go from there."" Needless to say I'm less than pleased with Airbnb's support by now, I've talked to several different ""case resolution managers"" who all just keep giving me links to things within the app, and none of them assuring me they will ban the guy from Airbnb for being a fraud and stealing from his guests.

I sent the guy a message through Airbnb saying, just FYI I gave the police all the serial numbers of what you stole, and I have GPS tracking on my items should you try to sell them (the second part isn't entirely true, since Tile requires a phone to be in-range of it to actually get the location.  Since Friday night it hasn't been picked up by any phones.  But he's not going to know that!) I said I'd be willing to drop the police report and Airbnb claim I filed against him if he returns my stuff (again, not true, I'm absolutely still keeping that police report open) No reply of course, so I text him the same message.  Still no reply.

Sunday morning I figure what the heck, I'll try one last time.  I said something along the lines of ""If you don't return my belongings, I will sue you for at least $3000 which is the value of the items you stole from me.""  Short and sweet.  He messaged back ""I filed a police report against you for phone harassment, don't contact me again""

I called the non-emergency police number and explained this all to them.  The lady said his supposed police report was complete bogus and that sending two messages asking for my stolen items back is absolutely not harassment, that it wouldn't hold up in court at all.  But either way, it's clear he's not going to return my stuff.

I'm now back in Michigan without any of my belongings.  The guy's probably going to try to sell my stuff.  He's also probably being evicted from his apartment but that doesn't help me in the slightest.

Airbnb is still ""working on the case and will contact you as soon as we can"", and I'm not expecting to hear anything from the police investigator for a week.

The lady at the police did say I can hire a lawyer in Michigan to sue the man in Chicago and not have to actually travel back to Chicago myself.  Though I'm not sure I'd trust that, I want to testify against the guy myself.

However, I've also never taken anyone to court before.  Only times I've ever been to court were for jury duty and to contest traffic tickets.  Hence why I'm asking for advice.  What can I really do at this point?  I've Googled the subject and most people are saying Airbnb just tells people to sue in incidents like this, they aren't a hotel and their insurance is to protect *hosts* from unruly *guests* and not vice-versa.  So I'm really not thinking they'll do anything either, and the guy's listings are still up as well.  Half tempted to hire someone else to book the place and go looking for my stuff, lol.

But seriously, what should I do?  Just sit and wait?  Hire a lawyer? Any advice is really appreciated.

A friend suggested I should sue for more than just what my stuff is worth, because of emotional trauma from the ordeal.  I believe the limit for small claims court is $5000, so I'm considering asking for the max.

tl;dr Airbnb host who knew I would be gone and unable to come for my belongings bent rules and ended my stay early, kept all my items in his apartment and lied to me saying he left them out for me to collect.  Tried to play it off as someone else stealing them, freaked when I confronted him on the lie and now refuses to cooperate with police nor give my stuff back.",legaladvice
WIBTA if I don't let my daughter put a lock on her door?,"My daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.  She says it's to keep her brother out - who barges into her room every now and then to bother her - but I'm not sure if the benefit is worth having the lock in place.

I don't like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and I'm worried she's trying to hide something from me or that she'll take the opportunity to lock me out. I admit that I've forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that I see no reason as to why she'd need a lock. 

The way I see it, it's my house and I am simply unwilling to have any locks put in anywhere. She's young, and doesn't really know what's she's asking for.

AITA for making my SIL cry at her baby shower by suggesting we should stop exchanging gifts in the future?,"I come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and I do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). We've always been very generous to his side of the family. Gifts are very much both my husband and my ""love language"" and in my culture (Chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. It also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. Additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. One concern of mine originally was to treat my husband's family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

Last Christmas, we had some weirdness over Christmas day present opening. I had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for SIL (husband's brother's wife). She googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later I overheard her make some joke about how she could pay ""half a mortgage payment.""  Several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she's tired of us ""throwing our money"" in her and her husband's face, and Christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. Husband and I apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. Although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

This past Saturday, I attended a baby shower for the same SIL. It's the first gift giving occasion since Christmas and I really wanted to do it carefully. I asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so I decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. Anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. Near the end of the event, MIL pulled me aside and said that SIL felt like I was being spiteful to her for  Christmas. I again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and I had written a check for the little one's college fund as well but didn't feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. Then I scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. When I found SIL by herself for a second I handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. She looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, ""We don't need your money.""

I kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that I was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. She started crying and I immediately left. I've been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how I ruined the baby shower ever since.

(ETA for additional  context - My husband and his family are American and we live in the US. We are in our early/mid 30s, my BIL is 28 and SIL is 24 or 25.)

(ETA2 - I realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. The throw was 320 pounds, which isn't quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. I purchased it for her during an business trip to Scotland last year. It is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious "" designer"" brand, just an old Scottish maker. It was intended to be good quality and last many years. If she hadn't looked it up I don't think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE2: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. 

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.


I was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but I thought I should provide an update on some recent events from a Mother from the pits of Satan's rectum.

On Saturday, I answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. They asked me if I was who I was, and I replied I was. They then said they were looking for my GF. I called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

The officers then split, one taking the GF to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

The officer who took me started asking me questions about how long GF had been here. If she had any contact with anyone else. If she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. I answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on GF. I asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

After a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. The moment they left, my GF told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if I had been hurting her. She was also asked if she was being held against her will. She said no to everything, of course. She said that the police received a call from her Mother saying she might be in danger, and that I could be abusive her.

I was fucking livid. I immediately said I was going to press charges against her - for what? I dunno. Harrassment probably?

My GF begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

Wtf? She sent police to my house to get me arrested. How is that sane thinking? I could lose my job if I was arrested and charged. What the hell is she thinking?

I told GF that if the Mother does anything like this again, I will definitely press charges. So the GF decides on Sunday to talk to the Mum to not do anything like this again.

They had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then I start hearing sobs. Immediately, I walked into the room, saw my GF was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

I plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as I heard ""hello?"" From the phone. Then I put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a Mother"" and hung up.

Then I held the GF for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

Apparently, the Mother was telling GF how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the Mother again, or her brother, or her deceased Father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat GF, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because GF would be going to damnation.

I told GF that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. I love her smile.

What do you think, if anything, should I do about the Mother? No doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


Response to some people from previous threads and PMs after thread was locked:

1 - Abortion was never an option. GF was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her Mother. And if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - You can believe my GF cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, I suppose.  Just FYI, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. Cheating...right........

Edit: 3 - My GF and I are still going to therapy about all of this.",relationship_advice
My gf is dirty as hell and I can't stand it,"So my gf (22f) is one of my biggest blessings in life, but man is this girl dirty as hell. When we first initially met she had told me, but I was like naw can't be that bad... boy was I wrong. 

Just a little back story... we have been together for about a year and live together. Let's talk dirty:

The kitchen - she loves to cook, but does not clean as she goes. Dishes will pile up. Trash gets full. Unless I clean the kitchen which is basically every day bc I can't stand the mess it will stay dirty. I have talked to her before about how I shouldn't have to clean every single day, but she just doesn't get it. 

Laundry - she will pile that shit up and let it pile forever. She be questioning whether garments are clean or dirty. Half the time I do her laundry and I have to ask her to fold it. If I don't, she will just add the clean clothes to another basket. 

Room- when she gets home from work she just takes her clothes off throughout the room when she could have just put it in the dirty laundry to begin with. She will bring food into the room and leave dirty plates and cups for DAYS. Things start to cultivate! 

Honestly, I have talked to her about cleanliness and how important it is, but she doesn't get it. I explained that we are now living together and we need to come to some sort of middle grounds. Whenever I bring it up she gets annoyed. She will clean the day after I mention it and then never do it again until I bring it up AGAIN. Ugh. Advice, suggestions?


EDIT: WOW this really blew up! I just wanted a little advice so that I could hear different perspectives. Some of you provided great advice so I appreciate that! Will definitely be talking to her to see what can work best for both of us.",relationship_advice
I(30F) am scarred by hearing so much about my fiance's (30F) past sex life because we have issues with sex,"Is it normal to have heard extensive details about your partners past lovers? I know about the random guy who ran into her on her bike whom she ended up fucking, the guy from work who was twice her age whom she wanted to have sex with SO BAD but he wouldn't fuck her as much as she wanted, her old boyfriend who could get her off 5 times in a row (I've gotten 2 out of her just once), the boys dorm where she made her way up and down the hallways, the married guy who she had a one night stand with, etc. etc. There are so many I can't even remember them all. Now, I'm constantly comparing myself to them and wonder why her libido isn't that high with me.

I am one of a handful of women my partner has been with. We just got engaged about a month ago (yay!) and have been together for a year and a few months, but this is an issue that concerns me for our future. For the majority of the time we have been together, sex has been an issue. She has a hard time with me initiating and usually turns me down. She has conveyed this is because sex for her isn't about love, it makes her feel trapped and like I want something from her. I've gotten to the point where I get severe anxiety about initiating and we have gone from having a lot of sex (like 5-6 times a week) to having sex sometimes just once a week. Even when we do, I usually feel anxious about it because I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. There are also feelings of resentment for me around it now because it's always on her terms, I feel like when we do do it, she probably doesn't really want to, and also PARTLY because (and this may be horrible of me) I struggle with worrying that she might just be with me (a woman) because she has felt used by men. Even just with kissing she struggles. At one point we were kissing and she jerked back and practically screamed at me how much she hates kissing me. Almost immediately afterward she started saying she didn't mean it and trying to take it back, and I haven't heard it since, but still now when I kiss her I just feel like she's waiting for it to be over. It breaks my heart and I don't know how to fix all of this and remove the pressure that we now both feel around sex and physical intimacy.

Edit: thank you for all of the perspective. Some common questions have been about her mental health and whether she is dependent on me for anything. She does have a Bipolar-II diagnosis, but is not treated for it. She also experiences depression and is treated for that.

TIFU by permanently burning myself trying to connect with my recently deceased dad.,"This was actually a week ago, but the story starts before that.

For the last five years, I've had an ice cream tub full of sugar in my kitchen. I emptied it into the tub rather than have the bag spill sugar whenever I used it. I don't use sugar a lot, so I've never had to refill it, I just dip into it when I need it.

My girlfriend thinks this is weird, and she thought it was weirder still when I packed the box to move with me when we decided to move in together.

""Don't bring your weird five year old sugar tub, for fuck's sake.""

""It's perfectly fine,"" said I. ""Sugar doesn't go off."" 

""It does,"" she said, wrongly.

""It doesn't and I'm not going to throw out totally useable sugar.""

So the sugar tub resides in our baking cupboard now, as a tiny point of pride. I want to see how long it takes for the sugar to run out. Maybe it will outlive me, at which point it will be inherited by my beautiful, supportive, wrong girlfriend.

---o---

Fast forward to this past January. My dad dies suddenly and unexpectedly. He falls off the roof while fixing a skylight, a day before someone was coming to start work on repairing the entire roof - including the skylight. But that was my dad to his core. He didn't know how to stop. He single-handedly ran his business - selling boating equipment and fixing outboard engines - for 47 years, a minimum of six days a week, until the day he died.

I am not that person. I love stopping. I'm self-employed too, but I put the bare minimum in to survive and spend the rest of the time doing whatever I like. My dad couldn't have lived like that. We were very different people, and that made his passing all the more difficult because now we'd never get any closer - the slightly awkward, stilted conversations I'd had with him in life were now all we had. That was as close as we'd gotten.

Fast forward again to last week, early June. We're trying to sell his shop, but it's a tip. Sadly, a couple of weeks before he died he invested around £50k in restocking the shop, and so the back shop is full to the ceiling with empty cardboard boxes. And the secondary room, his workshop, is full of tools, spare parts, half-empty paint cans and half-finished engines that haven't been touched in at least a decade, very likely double or triple that.

I get to work. Breaking down the cardboard boxes doesn't take as long as I thought, and after lunch I start on the workshop. My dad specialised in Seagull engines, which are now collectible, so I'm sorting everything into Rubbish piles and This Might Be Worth Something piles.

Then, at the back of a jammed drawer, under some oily rags and a grimy toothbrush, I find an ice cream tub. I open it up, and it's half-full of sugar.

The best before date is from 1998. So he's had this box of sugar since I was 12 years old. Maybe longer. For his coffee I'm assuming.

I call my mum through from the front of the shop.

""Look,"" I say. ""Dad had a box of sugar.""

""Why would he have a box of sugar?""

*""Because its perfectly bloody normal, that's why.""* I take a photo to send to my girlfriend, hoping my smugness will come across without needing to caption it.

""Won't it be out of date?""

""Guh, no.""

She doesn't look convinced. I lick my finger and dip it into the sugar.

""Look,"" I say, ""It's fine.""

I put it in my mouth, and know immediately that it's not sugar. It's bitter, and it's bubbling, and fuck everything my tongue is burning. I run out of the workshop and take a swig of coke, swill it around my mouth and spit it into the street. I do that another half dozen times, but I've already burned my tongue very badly. One of my dad's friends comes from the end of the pier.

""Everything okay?"" he asks.

""Yeah. Ugh. I just ate what I thought was sugar from an ice cream tub in the back. It wasn't sugar.""

He laughs. ""Why would your dad have had-""

""I DON'T KNOW.""

He walks in and comes back with the tub. It's caustic soda, he says. For cleaning engines.

I now have chemical burns on my tongue. It's been a week, and they haven't healed. I can't eat or drink anything in the least bit hot or acidic. I told my girlfriend, and she didn't even laugh. Apparently having an ice cream tub full of sugar isn't normal.

**Tl;dr: My girlfriend makes fun of me for having a big tub of old sugar. I find a big tub of old sugar in my late father's workshop, and in a haze of validation taste it. It's a chemical cleaning agent.**

AITA: I ditched a girl 40 minutes from her house on our first date,"I know the title already sounds like i'm a major asshole, but there is a few more variables that need to be discussed before you make your decision. 

Also, this is a throwaway acct for obvious reasons

So I meet a girl on Tinder named ""Kim"" and we exchange a few messages before deciding to meet up for coffee.

The date is going OK, although it was a bit boring, we grabbed our cup of starbucks (i paid) we chatted for a bit and decided to drive to a cool little outdoor park to go for a walk. 

We drive around 30 mins to this park, listened to a bit of music on the way, still getting to know each other a bit and everything was going fine. 

I parked, we got out of the car and walked a bit, still chatting, nothing deep, but the usual what you do for work, hobbies etc etc.

I had to take a leak, so I go to the bathroom and when I walked out, I noticed she was talking to a guy and he was being very flirty and when I walked up to them, he asked who I was and she responded: ""oh he's just my friend hahaha"" and he said he wanted to grab her number to go out for a drink sometime. She was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. 

At this point I was just over it. I wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me I have no future with her.

I decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. I didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it. 

Oh well, I honestly feel like a bit of an asshole, but also feel it was just in a sense considering what happened....",AmItheAsshole
TIFU By Ruining My Valentine's Date with My Girlfriend,"So my girl and I had a great night planned. I made reservations at her favorite restaurant. She got a sexy little number to wear for ""after dinner"" and sent me teasing texts all day. She absolutely loved the flowers I got her, and she presented me with a bouquet of homemade beef jerky. She then proceeded to spend, I kid you not, 3 hours getting ready.  She looked friggin' amazing though. We were both starving and she was really looking forward to a night out. 

So we get to the restaurant and get seated. The only menu they give us is this valentine's day special. I do some quick mental math and realize *this dinner is going to cost me close to $300.* 

Oh. Hell. NO. 

So my GF looks up from the wine list and sees I am antsy. She asks what's wrong. I mumble something about their prices having gone up. She asked if I wanted to go somewhere else and I jumped on it. Practically raced out of there. She followed along and sheepishly made excuses to the wait staff. 

So we get back to the car and I apologized and told her $300 was ridiculous for one dinner and she was like ""wait? what? It wasn't that much"" 

Turns out the menu prices were *per couple* not per person like I had thought. 

Once I realized that dinner would in fact have been in my budget. I tried to get her to go back to the restaurant. This is where I *really* fucked up. She kept saying no and that she didn't want to. She said she would be too embarassed to go back. I said that was ridiculous and I didn't understand why and I kept trying to get her to go back. Then she suddenly burst into tears and sobs ""Why. Aren't. You. LISTENING? It doesn't matter WHY all that matters is that it DOES. WHY do you want to push me into something that makes me feel so uncomfortable?""

Ah fuck. She kinda had a point. I apologize and drive her home. I asked if she wanted to go to any of the other restaurants on our route home. She said no since she ""looked like shit"" since her make up got all messed up from crying. (She didn't. She still looked gorgeous) 

We get home and I don't think anyone on the face of the planet has ever gotten changed from fancy clothes to sweats as fast as she did. I tried apologizing again, she said it was OK but she just wanted to be alone for a while. 

Now she and the cat are in the other room watching true crime documentaries. 

TL;DR I ruined date night by thinking the restaurant was over priced and leaving (It wasn't) then not listening to her. Now girlfriend and cat are probably plotting how to get away with my murder.

EDIT: Just to clear up some confusion from the way I worded it. Dinner was not $150 per person. They were doing a V day special where for $150 you got dinner, dessert, champagne and flowers for 2. 

EDIT 2: Wow! I can't believe how this blew up! Thanks everyone! Of course my first reddit gold is on a throw away. LOL but thank you!

(Update) Cease and Desist letter after posting a review on YT and tricked by developer for address/name,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z5mms/i_do_reviews_i_reveiced_a_cease_and_desist_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

So it's been an interesting two months, after my post I started contacting a few attorneys locally and eventually had to call the state bar for a referral because of the type of possible laws not a lot of people handle that like a normal lawyer does that's usually family/criminal.

I finally found an attorney that understood what I was talking about and wanted a link to the Reddit post and agreed with the majority of the top advice I received. 

He accepted a small retainer of $250 to respond to the cease and desist I received and a few possible future letters/calls.

He responded asking them exactly what statements I made that were false and requested exact times in the video that the statements were made. Since I previously privated the video we had to give them a different link. 

He also outlined what will happen should they continue stating that during discovery he will be requesting all communication between QA, play testing, developers, and management to see if they were aware of any of these bugs/issues that may compromise a customer's experience while playing etc.

It also included a paragraph basically calling them out for reaching out to me and lying about ""swag and wanting feedback"" to get my information to send a cease and desist instead of going through the proper legal channels to obtain this and the fact that I still have yet to receive any ""swag"" that this is clearly the case.

Also included that they need to preserve all the emails they sent to other reviewers because it's of interest in the possible upcoming legal action. He also requested they preserve all sorts or other communication between QA, developers etc.

So after he had confirmed receipt of the letter we waited and waited. Nothing for about a month but then I received 3 large boxes containing games, posters, statues, a custom PS4 limited edition console, bobble heads, Funko pops, just every piece of swag I think they have for 3-4 of their games and a letter saying ""Sorry it took so long for us to get this swag out to you!""

My attorney then sent out another letter asking about the status and their position on the cease and desist and we received a letter back with only a few sentences basically saying they made a mistake and we can expect no further correspondence on the matter and that the video can be reinstated if we so wish. 

He sent out another asking about the lost ad revenue due to me having to private the video since they admitted it was a mistake. They sent out a check for $500 and some papers I needed to sign basically saying the issue is over and I won't sue them.

Thank you LA, I didn't get sued and after it all I came out ahead. I'm still not going to link my channel or the video or name the company in question but thanks for all your help!",legaladvice

AITA for making fun of my boyfriend's penis,"Upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. Its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). In the privacy our relationship, I playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. However, he has complained in the past about how much he hates ""locker room moments"" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. 

So the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. One of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and I write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". They were all read aloud and when its revealed that I wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. My boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! Ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

After we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. He said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn't mad, just disappointed. He said that he would never make fun of me if I had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me I was beautiful no matter what. 

I felt really, really bad when he said that. I have apologized and things are fine now but I think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? Am I the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",AmItheAsshole

"Neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the TWO spaces in front of our home. After asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving ALL their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.","California here, getting that out of the way. And full disclosure, its not my home. The home belongs to my parents, but I house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus I love my parents and want what's best for them). I will just be saying MY home or MY driveway so I dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


These neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with ALL the memories. I thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

My parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. He has it parked in the middle so that it takes up ALL the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. It has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. Why? I don't know. Perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. All I know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

I want to also mention they have a full garage. They also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. And a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

I politely asked him to move his car when I saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. He followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. Several days later I visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

I spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since I had asked him to move his car as payback. They said he's really mean and to just let it go. This did not sit right to me, so I later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. I explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

Bad idea. I assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. I assumed mom would just tell 'Billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. Turns out he got it from mom and dad. I get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how I did NOT just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

I didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. My mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. Apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an FU to my mom and dad. That's also when their car got keyed

So since I made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. Now the parents are retaliating too.They finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. The one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. The beater was moved so its parked on the OTHER side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. Sorry for the run-on sentence. Did that all make sense? I hope so.

This has been going on for a few weeks now.

Is there anything that can be done? My parent's just seem to want to let it go. Not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. My parents travel a lot and my work makes it so I cant always be there to sit the house for them. They fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. I used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. Is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?

The older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

I got a phone call from my son on Saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

I jumped into my car and brought him home. I also yelled at the man and told him I'm calling the cops.

I then called an officer I knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

When we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

So while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

I'm happy he is rid of that predator but I'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

I have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

I hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

Thank you to everyone for telling me I wasn't completely crazy.",AmItheAsshole
"LPT: often, being liked doesn't require you to be interesting/funny. It just requires you to make other people feel interesting/funny.","I'm not saying people never gain pleasure from others being interesting or funny. But the fact is in most interactions, everybody is heavily self-monitoring and will base their judgement of the success of the interaction on how people responded to *them*. If people laughed at their joke. If people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. If people agreed with their opinion. 

So the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they're boring is: you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. Honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you're talking to. Listen. Ask questions/follow-up questions. Laugh at their jokes. And they'll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to. 

Edit: for those saying isn't this just ego-stroking or being fake, it's not about sucking up to the other person at all. It's just empowering you to worry less about what you're saying, because the other person is almost certainly experiencing you in terms of how you respond to what they say anyway.

Found out wife was married before me and never divorced,"My wife and I are getting divorced after 19 years of marriage. She moved out 2 weeks ago and is living with her parents. The kids are with me. One of my daughters was at grandma's house this week visiting her mom and grandma mentioned to her this is her second marriage. My daughter mentioned it to me when she got home. I phoned my wife and she told me her high school boyfriend (he was 18, she was 16) took off to Mexico and got legally married. When they broke up a year later, they just broke up, never divorced. 
I have called my attorney to get some answers on this, his legal aide said he is out until Tuesday. It is killing me. I basically have 2 questions. Was I even married? We wed in the U.S., not Mexico and divorcing in the U.S. And two, we have a beach house in Cabo San Lucas. Is that now owned by 3 people (her first husband) and will that affect the sale when we try to sell? 

Also, no, I did not file for divorce because of this. It was just growing apart. I actually think it is kind of funny as long as it doesn't mess things up.",legaladvice

AITA For ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?,"I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.

​

Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.

​

Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""

Me: ""It's John.""

​
Ted: ""What?""
​

Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""

Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""

Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""

​

This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""

​

Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.

​

Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

As promised, I ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""

E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.

Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""

​

I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.

Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

I (20m) was introduced to this girl (20f) and she is incredibly intimidating.,"I'm not sure what to do. This girl is a great and stable (first for me) and attractive and smart human being. I really like her and the friend who introduced us said the second I left her sight, she texted my friend about how hot I am which is a good sign. 

The thing is, I used to be able to draw back in like, 11th grade. She paints full canvases. I listen to music (but like really hard rock) sometimes I guess. She writes music, sings, and plays the piano. She's an accounting major when I'm in graphic design but only just started so all I can really show her is a super low effort picture I took so I could keep up with the class. 

This girl is incredibly intimidating to me. She knows all these ""show-off-able"" skills and tricks and they're really really cool and the best thing I can do is make fun of the shot-types used in Taken 3 and play video games. I have no idea how I can compare much less impress this girl and keep her interested. 

Note: we haven't even hung out 1 on 1 but there's obvious chemistry. Not enough to obscure the worries behind this post but we can hold an engaging conversation (neither of us have really talked about ourselves yet so idk if that even counts.)

Note 2, Electric Boogaloo: We've only hung out like, twice and it was always cut short. I know I'm overreacting. I just have no idea what to do about this.

Note 3 Return of the OP: okay so I'm going to clarify some stuff to get rid of some negative comments. By impress I mean more of keeping up with her than romantic comedy ""impress"" garbage and by show off I don't mean to show off I mean they're like party tricks or stuff you can physically show off to people or have proof you can do like a painting. I've got none if that.

My family and I don't even get along nor communicate much.  I lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

She's REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn't know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  I had to do it.  I told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don't know how to cope with this.  I can't eat.  I can't sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and I'm just disgusted.  I'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

Part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  I know in a while I'll be ok but I just don't know how to get from part a to part b.

AITA for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid?,"My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. 

So here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. 

Between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ""ok sure."" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. 

I want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

TIFU by almost getting my brother kicked out of my parents house over thermal paste,"obligatory this was a few years ago.

I work in the IT field, and have always been handy with computers.
Growing up, when I lived in my parents house, I did computer repair here and there, and often had many computer parts and accessories with me.
When I left my parents house, I ended up leaving a few things behind in my room.

My brother was still living with my parents at the time, and he has been known to dabble in illegal activities. So my mom is already on the paranoid side of things.

Fast forward about 2 years, and I get a frantic (frantic) call from my mom.

""I found a syringe in your room, and I think it's for drugs, but youre brother keeps lying to me and says it's yours! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?!?""

I ask some leading questions, and ask her what my brother said it was.

""He's saying it's for a computer, but I know better!""

Ok, is any writing on it? Does it have a needle?

""There's no needle, and there is a company name on the side""

Ok, well whats the company name? and did you google it?

""It says thermaltek on the side. And when I went to google it, all it came up with was computer parts! I know you don't use syringes for computers!!!""

Ok, so let's walk through this together ok?

1. You found said syringe and he said it was for a computer, and it was mine
2. You googled the company name and all you found were computer parts
3. you found it in my room
4. you know I work on computers
5. and there was no needles

It's thermal paste mom. It's used to apply a thin layer of paste for heat dispersion on the processor and graphics card. You're screaming at him over thermal paste. If it quacks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it swims like a duck.... Did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe he was telling the truth?

""Oh"" *click*

I give my brother a call to let him know what I just told my mom, and so he can never let her live it down.

tl;dr I forgot thermal paste in my room before I moved out, and my mom found it and instantly assumed my brother was shooting up heroin, and almost kicked him out, then wouldnt believe him after literally every piece of evidence was telling her otherwise.",tifu
"TIFU by trusting a ""hot local single in my area"" on a dating app.","Greatest/worst thing ever just happened to me, so buckle up folks..it's story time:




Girl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that I'm really cute (true) and interesting (also true) and asks me to meet her at 1140am for coffee at a random McDonald's. When I ask if she's a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they're straight from Facebook. Because that's how you convince somebody you're real (not true).




Now normally I don't accept propositions like this because I'm thinking ""what's the catch?"" Well, I decide to live a little on the YOLO side...and since it's right next to a Subway Sandwich shop I think that the worst that could happen is it's a 45 year old lonely man, I give him a big hug because I know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. Apparently that was NOT the worst thing that could happen.




I show up. She shows up. She's real. I'm surprised. I buy her coffee because I subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. She uses her McCafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. Its cute. While the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. I go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because I'm a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. No girl. I text her the typical guy message ""lol u get lost???"". No response. Turns out she took the coffee and left.




So I'm not saying it's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren't attracted to them. It's totally your decision. But I don't think that's the case...I think this girl is a serial McCafe dater. And I don't think this was her first time. It was too professional. Too clean. It was the perfect McHeist. And I'm starting to think I'm not even mad...she didn't steal my credit card, or my organs. Just a few euros.

AITA for stealing my friends bird,"I love birds, and I'm the proud owner of 2 budgies. I've had them for about a year and a half. When I first got them, my friend fell in love decided she wanted one of her own.

She then proceeded to spend the least amount of money she could on a cage and decorated it with minimal accessories. She got the bird, and while she seemed to like it at first, she basically ignored it after a month. 

Every time I went over to her house, I told her that it needed more attention. It just sat in the corner all day, silent, occasionally gnawing at the only toy in the cage, which was shredded and worn within the first couple of months. Its food and water were probably only changed once a week. It was living above a mountain of poop because she never changed the tray.

I told her repeatedly that she was neglecting her bird. And despite promising to do better, she never did. 

I asked her if I could have it. She got really upset with me, saying that she had paid for it so she had the right to do what she wanted with it. 

I felt really horrible every time I went over there. I decided I wanted to steal it. I felt like I could give it a better life. It could even make friends with my 2 birds. I just couldn't let it live the rest of its life unhappy in the corner of a cage, doing nothing. 

So I did it. She was in the bathroom, and I took a shoe box I had hidden in my backpack and got the bird in. It was scared at first, but it calmed down in the box. I left without even saying goodbye. 

Soon after I got a phone call which basically consisted of her yelling at me for a long while. I said that I'd give back her bird if she bought it a bigger cage, more toys, and promised to take better care of it. She once again used the argument of, ""Its my bird, I can do what I want with it.""

I took it home, where it livened up in the presence of my 2 other birds. It began chirping for the first time I had ever heard. It seemed very happy. 

This was all 3 days ago. My friend is still extremely pissed at me for not giving her bird back and is saying I'm being an asshole. So Reddit, AITA?

UPDATE: Wow, I was not expecting this to get so huge. 

I honestly went into this thinking I was going to keep the bird for probably 1 day or something before she profusely apologized and vowed to change her ways. She didn't. Like I said, I would have given it back if she had. 

I guess I just figured that she needed something drastic to snap her into the reality that she was neglecting her bird. Which now, after reading the comments, I understand was a pretty immature way of handling things. 

Today I offered her $50 as reimbursement, which was double what she bought the bird for. She took it and is letting me keep the bird. But she still hates me. Honestly, at this point, I couldn't care less. The bird is safe. That's all that matters.

I think I could've handled it better, but I don't regret my choices. Thanks for the advice, support, and reality checks, everyone.",AmItheAsshole

My wife's mother tickles our son inappropriately and my wife defends her - help?,"Hi everyone. I am a 35M married to a 27F. 

We have a 2 year old son. Ever since I can remember, my wife's mother has tickled him. Usually in normal places but also in places where it shouldn't be okay to tickle someone. 

I recently read something that women can actually be child molesters too but it's often overlooked because people give them more leeway and ignore all the signs.

And when I thought about it, I realized that exactly described this scenario. If this were her father or my own father then this would definitely not be tolerated ever!

But the fact that it's my mother in law... who is mother to... my wife... makes it complicated.

I recently called me wife out on it for the Nth time and she came back with ""you have a sick mind to think that my mom would ever molest a child - in fact YOURE the deranged one because you're sexualizing it!""

I actually felt guilty because I felt like maybe I was the one viewing it that way and maybe it is my fault for seeing something that's not there and overreacting.

While my son doesn't seem to have a problem with it, I wonder what example that it's setting for him about boundaries and touching. What if he starts tickling other boys or even girls down there because he learned it from her?

What happens if it progresses into more?

Farenheit is superior to Celsius,"Farenheit is a better system for the use case for temperatures that 99% of the population has: temperature of the weather. It's better for two reasons:

1) The scale is far more intuitive. It's approximately 0-100, with 0 being really cold and 100 being really hot. 50 is about average. Temps below 0 and above 100 are possible, but rare and extreme. That tells you everything you need to know to interpret a temperature, without having personal experience with it. Conversely, the same range in Celsius is -18 to 38. Utterly meaningless. 

2) Farenheit is 2x more precise than Celsius. You would never need to use decimal or ""half"" degrees, because each degree is a small increment. This is related to #1 because the precision is scaled to about 0-100. 

If you are a scientist in a lab, having a scale from water freezing to water boiling is logical. In normal life it's meaningless and it leads to an inferior temperature measurement.

My son (12) went through TSA with carryon luggage and a backpack with money that is now missing...what do I do?,"Ok so my son left Louisville early this am to fly to Tampa and he had 2 envelopes with money in them in seperate pockets in his carryon luggage bag. When he went through screening he said his luggage was missing and could only find his backpack and shoes for a moment until his luggage finally came out. He stated  several other people behind him had already gotten their luggage. So it sounds like TSA placed his bag back through for some reason? He said they did not bring him over to open his bag and being 12 thought nothing of it, really. He went straight from TSA and boarded. His flight landed and I was at the gate waiting for him. When we got to the car he wanted to take the money out and have me put it in the bank for him. Obviously, it was gone.  All he had in his luggage was literally only clothes and those 2 envelopes. What can I do really? 

edited to add update:
The money was his that he got for Christmas. His dad held onto it until they got to TSA and said he watched my son place the envelopes in the bag in different pockets.

He is reasonably responsible with his money as well and had made plans to save it up for some nerf guns and such. I filed a report with TSA as well as contacted the airline and both airports lost and found. So hopefully we will get some answers soon or at least an idea. 

It definitely could have been somehow lost between TSA and the final gate but I think we have covered our bases as much as we can right now. Unfortunately, it's one of those sucky life lessons.

TIFU by accidentally taking my boyfriend on his nightmare date.,"Full disclosure, this happened several years ago (and he is now my ex boyfriend), but something made me remember this story today.

My ex-boyfriend was a big fan of grand gestures and surprise dates. He took me to all kinds of cool stuff to surprise me, like an Obon Festival, a special old school Star Trek movie showing, an art museum, even a surprise interstate road trip on my birthday! For his birthday, I resolved to pay him back with his own nice surprise. We had been together for \~10 months at that point, so I thought I knew what would suit him: a picnic at a beautiful outdoor conservatory, a walk around the zoo, and the surprise: tickets to a butterfly conservatory, basically a glass dome filled with lush greenery, flowers, and hundreds of butterfly species flying freely. [(Not this specific one, but this video gives you an idea what it's like)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeMo5o46rso)

I had always gone to the butterfly house with my family as a little kid and I loved it soooooo much. It was special to me and I was so excited to share it with him.

He was having a great time walking around with me by the lakes and at the picnic. I kept hyping him up, saying ""I can't wait until the final surprise, I hope you love it! You're going to love it!""

We got to the entrance, they tore our tickets, and I led him in Belle-at-the-library-in-Beauty-&-the-Beast style. I still won't shut up, trying to get him hyped. Finally, the moment of truth: I took my hands off his eyes and watched him behold the kaleidoscopic beauty surrounding him.

Immediately, his face blanched and he looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.

He was cowering and clinging to my arm when a butterfly flew past him.

""Umm... are you OK, dear?""

""I'm.... fine..."" he said with a classic Hide the Pain Harold grimace.

""You don't seem fine. Did something happen?""

He looked ill and muttered ""why would people pay to go to a place people let disgusting bugs land on them"". I must have looked hurt because he tried to pull himself together, put on a brave face, and grabbed my arm tight. Before we could even get going any further, he pulled away from me and started shouting ""OH GOD, IT'S IN YOUR HAIR, IT'S IN YOUR HAIR."" Before I could even tell what was going on, he had tried to run out the exit with employees chasing him, calling ""wait! we have to check you for stowaway butterflies!"" It was chaos. Kids were watching him from their strollers. Some were screaming and crying. 

When I finally caught up with him, he had thrown up in the trash can by the duck pond. I apologized profusely and he said it wasn't my fault - his fear of moths/butterflies just hadn't come up in conversation yet. I couldn't have known.

We just kind of stared blankly at the pond until he said, ""Let's just go home."" 

It took me months before I felt comfortable trying to surprise him again, and surprise surprise, I managed to screw that up too. (it's the Nightmare Redux: Thai Surprise in the comments)

TL;DR: I accidentally traumatized my moth-phobic now-ex-boyfriend by enclosing him in a space with hundreds of butterflies. 

EDIT: Sorry, I accidentally deleted like half this post trying to edit it. Dang. I hope I cobbled it back together properly. 

1. Please don't be mean, phobias are irrational by definition. It's not his fault. 
2. I was really dumb and young in this story and I don't try to surprise people anymore (unless it's something they explicitly said they wanted). I thought it was fair game to try to share something from my childhood because he had taken me to a mediocre Fargo pizza place that was his favorite childhood restaurant just a few weeks earlier. 

He did also have surprise cheesecake waiting for him when he got back (favorite dessert), so at least the day wasn't destroyed completely.",tifu

I have received so much amazing information on this post since I made it. Unfortunately it is a holiday today and I am going to try spending today with friends. I am, however, going to follow up tomorrow with the police department and see if we can't figure this out. No updates or calls back as of yet... I'll keep everyone posted.

As of 12/31 at 3:40PM EST I have called about filing a complaint with the police officer in question. I have yet to get a call back. I'll update everyone here when I get a call back (if I do.)

Hello Legal Advice!

So, here's some backstory:

Me and my fiancé moved into this new place back in April. We've been living here since then. The town I live in is incredibly small and only has around 150-200 people, maybe more. The cops around here are notorious for pulling people over. There is a major highway that runs between here and Cincinnati. They are most always out on that road because the city jurisdiction extends across that highway, they almost are never monitoring what's happening in town. 

Fast forward until now. There was a cop sitting at the 4 way in the middle of town that my fiancé had passed (she works with horses and drives a truck that's kinda loud). She was pulled over (in our driveway) for this exhaust issue. She took the loud exhaust ticket, paid it, we put a new exhaust that helped quiet down the truck, all is good. Right? Nah.

Now, this guy knows where we live. He drives by all the time and he knows when my fiancé leaves for work. He follows me now, in my 2010 Honda Civic (it's a completely legal car, no real reason for him to be following me) all the time as I do the speed limit, pay my taxes and abide by the law. There is an abandoned house across the road where he will sit at and ""clock"" people, however, it's right across from our home.

Today was the last straw. When my fiancé was leaving for work, we was headed in from town from picking up our cat from the vet. He is sitting at the 4-way stop sign in town. He sees us and makes eye contact with us and then as I'm almost home begins pulling out. My fiancé needed to go to work, so I decided to let her use my car so that way there was no risk of her being pulled over in her truck (even though we fixed the exhaust like he asked).

On her way out, he sees her leaving and pulls up and blocks the driveway, not allowing my fiancé to leave. He sits there for about a minute and then drives down the road a bit, waiting for her to pull out so he can stop her. She calls me and says she's afraid to leave, so I tell her to stay for a bit. He eventually pulled off and pulled over another loud truck.

Here's the kicker. My ring doorbell has the entire occurrence of him blocking our driveway on camera. I've saved a copy to my phones storage. What can we do about this? This is clearly harassment and this guy doesn't let up. It's a shame when I'm fearful to leave the privacy of my home because this guys following us around in an unusual way. Is there any way I can make a city complaint against him to get him to stop? I only fear this will make things a lot worse. Cops are meant to protect and serve, not harass and observe. 

Feeling lost here, could anyone give me some useful advice?

Thanks, sorry for the long post.",legaladvice

TIFU By Masturbating Too Hard Which Led To Having Surgery,"Obligatory this didn't happen today but when I was in the 8th Grade.

8th Grade was about the first time I discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (Whatever year they show the ""Birds and the Bees"" movie at school) Well, needless to say, I was all for it. I think I did it just about everyday after school. And I was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.

One day in particular though, I wanted to see how fast I could do the deed. So after school I ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. I counted down from three and went full speed. Let's just say I was a little too rough with my ding\-ding.

After I beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times I had ""spatooshed"". I just assumed I over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so I laid down on my bed to take a nap. The tightness never went away so I had a hard time falling asleep. The tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.

I was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. I told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (I failed to mention that my Dangly Bits hurt a little bit too) So my Dad, being the classic Mexican dad that he is, just said ""Just drink this 7up and take some Tums and you'll be fine in no time."" Unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""Thats it, I can't take it anymore. We're going to the hospital.""

Oh. My. Lanta. Talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. Every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  I thought I was going to pass out from the pain. This was my new worst pain of my life.

We eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. I tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. I didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th Grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. So they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. At this point it's been 2\-3 hours since I got there so I say screw it and I finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""Hey Mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" Right away she yells WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?! Then she calls a nurse to take a look.

The nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then MANHANDLES MY BEANBAGS! For those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. So this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! I SCREAM in pain. Now, I would never hit a woman in my life but I would be lying if told you I didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. Haha. Remember when I said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? Well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. Anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

The surgery was quick and I didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. They went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. I just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then I was back to ""normal"". Well, because Righty decided to take a left turn at Albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. Thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. This means Righty shrunk. Like a lot. Lets just say Lefty towers over the little guy now. Could be worst though. The doctor said 30 more minutes and I would've lost him.

I ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. Rob and Big, Dr. Evil and Mini Me, Pinky and the Brain are some of my favorites. Lol.

Lesson to be learned here: Some things are meant to be taken slow.

TL;DR  Wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.

AITA for making a dad joke?,"Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline's father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she's rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said ""You're not my dad. I don't have to follow you"". Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn't mean it, and that she'd probably change. I just replied ""I'm still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules."" 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said ""I'm hungry. I need food."" I decide to be extremely cheeky and say ""Hi Hungry, I'm not your dad."" My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me ""Not to stoop down to her level."" 
 
I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?
 
Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.

 
Mini Update: I'll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter's room after dinner and begin talking with her. ""Hey.

AITA for telling my roommate that guys who go to porn conventions are losers?,"I (26M) and roommates with (30M). Let's call him Mark. Mark told me that he is considering to buy ticketed to a porn convention and my first reaction was to laugh. He asked why I laughed so I just explained.

AITA for refusing to wear a bra while my boyfriend's friend is staying at our apartment?,"About a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and I said yes. So the next day his friend shows up while I'm at work. When I get home I greet the friend (who I've never met before). I then proceed to go to the bedroom where I change out of my work clothes and throw on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. I never wear a bra at home as I find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. I then go out to the living room to join them. As I'm sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of ""dude, put on a bra"". I figure he's joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so I just brush it off. He doesn't bring it up again for the rest of that visit. 

Fast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. So his friend comes over and this time I'm home when he gets dropped off.  I was not wearing a bra when he arrived. I would like to point out that I was wearing a rather baggy T-shirt so it wasn't as if you could really see anything. That being said I do have enormous titties (I wear a size 40I bra). Immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone ""I thought I asked you last time to please wear a bra!!""  I'm taken aback and I don't really know what to say. I kind of stammer our a ""what,why?"" 

Him: I feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs 
Me: But you can't actually see my boobs 
Him: Are you kidding me? They're huge! Of course I can see them! 
Me: Dude, I'm wearing a baggy shirt. At most you can see a bit of an outline. I don't understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. 
Him: you're joking right??
Me: No...? 
Him: fucking unbelievable

I look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. So I excuse myself to the bedroom. A little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if I'm ok. I tell him I'm fine, just a bit taken aback. He asks if I wanna come play video games with them in the living room and I agree. Before we're out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe I should put on a bra.  I had explained to him before how I felt about bras. He said he understood but didn't want to make his friend uncomfortable. I was annoyed and told him I would just stay in the bedroom. So for the rest of his friend's stay I stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. 

So finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. Then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. He tells me I should've just sucked it up and put on a bra and that I was kind of being an asshole about it. I feel like I should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also I wonder if I should've been more accommodating to a guest that's very important to my bf. 
So, am I the asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA For telling step-daughter she's the reason for divorce,"Yeah, I'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.

I came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. Her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). Her mother is not happy. She hasn't been happy for a long time. Her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids I've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.

She's made it no secret she hates me. I remember when she was 13 or 14, I paid for us to go to Disney land as a family vacation (cliche, I know). She refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. I was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, I went along with it and stayed home.

Stuff like that is the norm. She'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. She'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. It's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. But it's ruined the marriage, because I've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. Anything I do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. Though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

Anyway, my wife and I separated over this. It's just too much for me to bare. But I'm not mad at my wife, I'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

I decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. I didn't do this to spite her, because frankly I'm ready to move on with my life. I did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. I did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

Wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. Say it's going to emotionally scar her. But quite frankly, I think she needed to be told.

TIFU by confessing to my friend I wanted to fuck her,"Obligatory this happened on Monday. So, I have been single for a while and a friend of mine gave me a contact last year, saying you and this girl will probably get along well. And that we did, from December to this month we have steadily been growing closer and having tonnes of fun along the way. Sans sexual flirting though. I even nicknamed her my almost soulmate because things just flowed between us. Until last week Friday when I decided to visit her for Easter (she stays in a nearby city).

Now remember I've been single for a long time.  And my raging-hormone to logic ratio is at an all time high, thanks to a total lack of outlets. So when she said the entire visit should be spent indoors I thought Finally. This is where it happens. I packed 2 condoms to the visit and sprayed deo like a mad man. Got there and things were going great really, until after one hour of YouTube videos I got nervous and then desperate BUT I didn't make a move. For some reason I believed something would magically happen and we would end up in sexy time. You can imagine my inevitable disappointment when I had to leave.

So just before we parted she suggested we take pictures and I said cool but really all I could think about was how I had failed at the only booty chance I had had in a year. Needless to say I didn't look overly enthusiastic, or even remotely happy on the pictures. Which apparently bothered her as she thought I didn't want pics with her because she is ugly (which she isn't) and for the weekend she kept on bringing it up and I kept on saying I was really anxious to travel back home in time. Which of course she didn't buy and eventually I thought hey let me just tell her the truth. So on Monday I sent her a pic of the condoms and explained my disappointment and sexual frustration, trying to reassure her that she isn't ugly.

And now, well, its been 3 days since we spoke. Thanks, Hormone Monster.

**TL;DR: Confessed that I was disappointed we didn't get to sexy time with a good friend and now she won't text me**

TIFU by masturbating in front of my entire family,"This happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

Stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. Aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which I was extremely anxious about. All together, I was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager I am, I often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

So, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, I lay down in my living room with my family, watching TV. I dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. Being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since I had done next to no study at the time). 

Not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, I decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

And so off I went. Except I forgot one thing.

I was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

Somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that I was not in fact sitting with my family by our TV, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

I don't really understand how or why it happened. A few seconds in and I began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

I snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment I put myself in. 

I'm not going to talk about what happened next, as I don't want to relive the next few moments.

My father is just disappointed. He hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

My mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as I write this. 

And I'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. I find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe I was just dreaming while I was gassed up. 

But it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

"LPT: A goal towards a tidier home is not through periodic 'binge cleaning' but by keeping the house clean through small, everyday tasks.","To have a tidy, livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors, you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday.

For example: If you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game, put it back after use.

If you use a blanket, fold it up after you get up. Anything that is displaced when in use - even a pencil or a remote.

Instead of piling dishes in the sink, try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it. This will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after you're done cooking. 
[EXTRA PROTIP: if you have something on the kitchen counter, put it where it belongs (even in the sink) so that your counter is always clear. Even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters, it's still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters.]

What this leaves is a tidier, clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming, dusting, and/or mopping. When unexpected visitors arrive, you don't have to scramble.

I never have to do much in my room. My closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place. I have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later. It works for them but I don't think thats an efficient method.

Of course its harder when there are more people in the house, but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce.

EDIT: Massive response, thanks! The point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1) doesn't buildup 2) helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3) makes your home's default setting as 'clean' :) 

Also, if your house is massively cluttered, then it's a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday. It's said that if you do something for long enough, say 40 days, it becomes a habit. 
EDIT 2: When you rely on binge cleaning, your mindset is that you don't want to do it now because you can do it later. This makes you less likely to clean as you go. Whats the point when you can do it later? So the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself.
Also i missed a word in the title, sorry!

My boyfriend (21M) hates my (20F) vagina with a passion,"I recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn't like my vagina. He said it just looks unappealing and he doesn't wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. He gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so I didn't push him to continue until I finished and I said he could stop. He doesn't like fingering me either. He basically just said that he doesn't like looking at it or anything. He said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

So I thought I had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. My inner labia are not long or stick out and I'm an innie or whatever. I taste and smell fine. I think he just doesn't like vaginas. But he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it's just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. No attention down there. I do cum but I have to touch myself because he won't do it. It's just basically like he's having sex with me and I'm masturbating like rubbing my own clit so I can get off too. I don't wanna force him to do anything he doesn't like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? He's 100% straight and he likes boobs and he's attracted to girls and he likes when I wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. He just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. His penis is not beautiful I still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. Idk it's weird. 

My friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. My friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they're always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. Not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. My friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. My boyfriend doesn't even like to ever look at my butthole. My boyfriend thinks it's disgusting if I get too wet and he said it's like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if I drip onto his sheets and dirty them. He will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that's it. I get jealous sometimes. I wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. It sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. It's like he hates me for having a vagina or something. He's never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. G",relationship_advice
Pretty sure the 16 year old who lives above us is living alone. Is this neglect?,"Single mom and her daughter live above us (in CT). The daughter is a music student and we constantly have to hear her playing guitar or keyboard WITH AN AMP, singing (more like screeching) into a microphone, and producing shitty beats with too much base. 

She plays music WAY louder than she needs to to practice. Its louder than our TV much of the time. Her mother usually leaves every night before 8 (if she has been home at all that day) and comes home in the morning to (presumably) shower and then go to work. Mother MIGHT be home 1 or 2 nights per week.

Her daughter obviously takes advantage of this and has friends over. They are so loud some nights that they are clearly drunk. Other nights she will sing into a microphone until midnight. They wake us up all hours of the night on weekends and weekdays. The mother complains to us that her apartment smells like weed ""all the time"" and blames it on us, since we are below her. Preeeeeetty sure it's her own kid, though, because we don't smoke in or around the house. 

So this kid basically lives along with very little supervision. Is this legal? Should we get cops involved? We've been hesitant because we fear retaliation, but can't stand this anymore and need to do something!",legaladvice

Mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that I said I don't want to pay,"So my parents are heavily Mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if I had paid my tithing I told them no. They then asked me if I had a plan to fix that and I told them that I worked too hard just to give that money away.

Anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as I am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

This isn't legal right?

*Update: I plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. I will leave some in as to not look suspicious. I will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*Update 2: Ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

Turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. He's stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. My mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. She said she'll give me the rest back and that she's still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. I'm at a loss what to do next.

*Update 3: Doesn't sound like I'm getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. My mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. My dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

I'm still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can't touch it. Just in case they get any ideas.",legaladvice

My [26F] girlfriend [24F] thinks she's an Instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!,"When I met my girlfriend 3 years ago, I knew very quickly she was addicted to Instagram. She was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

This didn't really bother me at first - I actually found it kind of hot? Mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - I felt, I guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then I think).

Other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. Every day is punctuated by ""Insta time"" where I'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for Instagram content... It's ridiculous. We've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, I'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. I'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

It was routine stuff, I asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

So the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. She desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. She's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but I didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for IG, she was actually trying to make money from it. I know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

Essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. Before you say it - yes, I'm probably going to break up with her. But the thing is, she's got a really good heart and I genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). Is there anything I can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

Tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an Instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",relationship_advice

41M questioning sexuality after making a new friend.,"EDIT: My update post following this was removed, going forward I will be posting any updates directly on my profile, so feel free to follow this account for future updates.  


Throwaway account as I am an avid Redditor. I have been contemplating writing this out because I feel like that action alone could offer me some much needed introspection. I will try not to drag on but I apologize If I do.

I (41M) have always considered myself comfortable with who I have grown to be, I have worked hard in life, have a 4 year degree, a great career, financial stability, loving friends, wonderful family. In many ways I have done well for myself, however, in terms of love, I am missing my mark. I have been single for about 7 years, prior to that I have dated my fair share, never was engaged or married, but I've had long term relationships, weekend flings and everything in between. Following my last relationship I decided to take a break from the dating scene and work on my career goals. So far, it's paid off, jumping 2 promotions in 7 years. I have felt unfulfilled in that department, but I was surprised how easily I could go 7 years without missing dating or companionship. I just simply don't miss it much.

A friend invited me out for beers and darts a few weeks ago. We usually go to the same little pub, where we know most of the normal faces. It's not uncommon for us to mix with the people playing at the board next to us. This night was no different, 2 guys set up on the board next to ours, we made small talk with them here and there, one of the men said his goodbyes and left, the other guy stayed behind and shot darts by himself, we offered him (lets call him James) a place on our board and shot some games of cut throat. things got fun, we drank quite a bit and we were having a lot of fun. My friend said he was ready to take off but James and I were having a good time so we decided to stay a bit longer.

My friend took off, James and I had a couple more rounds, we had quite a bit in common and It felt like I was hanging out with an old friend. He told me he had a rec room with a pool table and dart boards at his house with a built in bar. He showed me a few pictures of the room and I was thoroughly impressed. He suggested we go hangout there and I was on board. Since neither of us drove to the bar, we caught an Uber to his house which was only a few minutes away. We shot a few games of pool and chatted about more personal stuff, our past relationships, careers, college, upbringing, etc. James is a lot like me, never married and a career-minded guy. Things sort of took a turn in conversation when James asked me about my sexuality. He asked if I ever had a phase or experimented. I sort of laughed a bit and said no no, that wasn't something I'd ever done. He made one or two small remarks about it in jest and that was it. About another hour past and I told him I was taking off, we exchanged numbers and agreed to hangout again the following weekend, foregoing the bar and hanging out at his place to cook out on the grill.

I get home, off to bed, I get a text from him asking if I made it home safe, I didn't think too much into it but I did tell him I got home safe. The next day, Sunday. I got up and did my normal Sunday shuffle-off-the-Saturday-night-booze of going  on a jog, hitting my favorite lunch spot and recovering the rest of the day on the couch. About 3p I get a text from James asking If I was interested in coming over around 6p, he was going to grill some fish up and have a couple friends over. I thought that would be fun, so I went. We had another good time, this time I only stayed a couple hours and when I got there he told me his two friends cancelled so it would just be us. It wasn't a huge deal, he was good company. I took off around 9p. He sent me a text about 10 minutes after leaving saying he had fun and is looking forward to the weekend plans we made. I texted him back that I was looking forward to it as well.

The following day James sent me a text telling me about something funny that happened to him at work that morning, I don't keep my phone on me during work so I didn't see it until lunch time. I feel like it's important to note, I don't text people throughout the day, I guess I'm sort of old school but I don't chit chat with people via text often, so to me, James is reaching out more than I'm used to friends doing, but I didn't mind. I looked forward to talking to him. After work I went to the gym per usual and home. I saw someone who kinda looked like him, it made me think of him. On one of the TVs in front of the treadmills they were showing a TV show we talked about, it made me think of him. At the grocery store picking up dinner stuff, I walked past the seafood section and it made me think of him.

We texted throughout the week, I even started keeping my phone at my desk so I could text him. This isn't like me at all. Finally Saturday comes around and plans go off like normal, I actually got to his place a couple hours early. He suggested I invite my friend I was with when we met (well call him Mark), I did and Mark came along with me. We all had a terrific time, James cooked for us, we had plenty to eat and drink, spent time in the pool, shot darts, it was a blast. The end of the night comes around, Mark said he wanted to take off and again, I felt the urge to stay and hangout longer. Which is exactly what I did. This time we sat on his pool deck until 2 am talking about everything you could imagine. I realized the time and had to take off, he understood and instead of shaking hands he hugged me, this is not usual for me whatsoever, but it felt so naturally acceptable, like I WANTED him to do it. I left and this time I texted him from my Uber telling him that I'll let him know when I arrive safely.

That was a week ago, we didn't hangout this past weekend but we've texted daily and made plans to go hiking this coming Saturday. I thought about the way I feel about him and I've concluded it's the same way you feel when you meet someone who you fall in love with. Coupling that with his questioning me if I've ever fooled around with guys or had an 'experimental phase' kind of makes me think he feels the way I do and he may be gay or at least bi-sexual. I'm torn as far as what to do, because I love this feeling and I think I'm falling in love with this guy. It feels so strange to type that out but I think it's true. He is definitely flirting with me and I have decided I am definitely flirting back with him. Should I have a talk with him directly about this? Should I make a move on him? What if I do and it feels wrong? I have so many questions and I don't even know where to begin. Has anybody had this sort of thing happen? Is the reason I had no qualms with being single for so long because I lost interest in women subconsciously?  I have never outwardly been attracted to guys, but this isn't an attraction to a person physicality, this is deeper than that, which is why it's really screwing with me. Sorry I rambled a lot, but just typing this has been therapeutic. Thank you for reading.

TL;DR: Straight-identifying guy makes new friend at a bar, talks to him everyday, conflicted if I'm falling in love with him.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I (29M) showed up to my gf's (25F) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am.,"Update to original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw3cuz/i_29m_showed_up_to_my_gfs_25f_house_and_found_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This all happening a couple days before what would have been our anniversary. I obviously should have seen the signs from the first post but the first part of this update is letting you guys know that I initially did not end the relationship. (What a regret).

How I handled it was we met the next morning to talk and I let her explain her side of things. She explained that other people were at the house that night earlier and she was going to be hanging around with kids from class sometimes now that school has started. Keep in mind, she is 25 and going back to school now, and most these kids are around 19-22. Nothing super serious as far as class load is concerned, she is studying theater at a community college. I explain to her why all signs point to that being a major red flag, she somewhat hears me out and apologizes for not better communicating her plans that night, but defends herself that hanging out with friends from class is not wrong. So in the future she would be communicate better about her plans and do a better job not making me feel concerned.

I was obviously angry and upset about the previous situation but I did truly love this girl and was willing to give things a chance to progress forward and her show me the positives changes.

We had continued our relationship and everything was going good for the most part. Then recently communication did not seem to be going the best and there were some signs that she wasn't giving as much effort into the things we spoke about before as she had promised to do. There were signs of her actively trying to pick fights, and perpetuating them longer than needed even when i had made attempts to reconcile and move forward from any arguments. I did feel heavily at this time that she was not respecting me in these conversations, and any attempts I made to lovingly let her know this...met with hostility. Which she then would attempt to turn right back on me, like it was my fault the fight even happened. This was getting old but I was still making every effort to bring us back to a good space on a more every day basis because i was wildly in love with this girl and the connection i thought we shared. The deceiving thing as well is that she was also very good at making me feel at other times she felt the same way about me, 'You're the love of my life, I Love you more than anything, Future plans together, talking about how lucky she was to be with me' etc. These were all exploited to be absolute lies.

Fast forward to a few nights ago. We had plans to hang out that night and when i asked her earlier in the day what she wanted to do, she told me she had actually agreed to go get sushi with a friend she hadn't seen in awhile. I let her know this upset me since she was bailing on our plans, but in attempts to be understanding I then suggested we just meet up after instead and go out that night to do something fun. She did not give me a definite answer but kept bouncing around the subject saying she would keep me updated on when she was finished. I let her know, 'Hey you don't cancel plans with your bf, then when hes cool about it and tries to suggest something else... leave him up in the air saying maybe we can hang' It makes me feel like not a priority and isn't how you treat someone you love. She ends up going off on me again and we leave on the terms of Ok we will just talk later. I call later and let her know that after dinner it would mean a lot if we could spend some quality time together, I had been wanting that since all the time we were hanging out was during the day with other stuff going on sometimes.

She calls me after dinner around 930pm and lets me know she is home. I ask her to comer hang out so we can figure out what to do, and she deflects with ""Oh my other friend (girl who i know) wanted to go to a midnight showing of a movie tonight and i haven't seen her in so long"".... I know i may seem completely stupid to you guys at this point but i assure you I was already seeing through her bullshit and knew something wasn't right. I keep calm and just let her know i think that was messed up, bums me out, and that i wish she would at least try to include me with her friends when doing stuff like that. She then takes to the level of trying to make me feel bad that I cant just be understanding she maybe wants to hang out with her friends without me sometimes. She tells me she will call me after the movie and asks if she can come over and spend the night with me after its finished...

Meanwhile, I knew I had friends going out that night as well and I could go grab some drinks with them, finish up around same time and then meet back at my house to spend the night together. I did not tell her I was going out because it did not seem relevant at the time, and i had some weird suspicions that something else was going on.

1:45 AM rolls around and Im leaving the bar with some friends to grab a burrito before heading home. I walk down the street and LO AND BEHOLD there she is on the corner of the street standing with a guy. One of the same guys from that night at the house in my original post. Shocker, I know. I confront her and ask her whats going on, she attempts to even further lie, explain how her gf was suppose to come to (like that makes it any better lol) it isnt what it looks like, blah blah blah same old bullshit lies and NO accountability even when caught in a dead lie on a date with another guy. I turn to the guy and ask him whats going on, he explains he invited to the movies, not much else, looks kind of scared because I'm sure i was irate. I have no problem with him at all because its 100% my then gf's fault. I walk to the side with her and ask her to just be real with me for once, tell me whats going, and come to terms with who she is and what shes done here. She shuts down when she realizes she cant talk her way out of things, and tries to ask if we can talk tomorrow and not make a scene here. I tell her if you want to explain yourself then you can leave right now and i will at least hear you out. She says no im not leaving my friend here alone you are overreacting and its not as bad as it looks. Even though i'm pretty hurt at this point I cant help but to bust out in laughter at the disbelief of the whole thing now. I tell her this is it and this relationship is fully done now then. Should have been done awhile ago, but that seals the deal and I truly see you for who you are now, a lying manipulative actual sociopath. I left with my friends, blocked her on everything and am now moving forward for good.

I do want to say though, I made a huge mistake in this whole scenario by not leaving when my gut told me to. So many signs pointed to her being so fake, such a liar, and not trust worthy at all... but i let the good times and her manipulative words keep me around thinking that i Just needed to make more effort myself to make things work. And it wasn't until i had fully given all of myself into trying, that i was hit with the most disrespectful thing I have ever had done to me. Listen to your gut people, and follow you intuition. If you are making clear efforts in a relationship with someone and they are giving you nothing back, creating friction, and show no remorse in any of their mistakes... run for the hills.

Even though i was very hurt by the deceit and catching someone cheat on me, I ultimately know this is 100% for the best and a huge blessing in disguise because this person never truly loved me the way I cared for them. Who knows how much longer I would have stuck around and let myself be treated like this, but I am grateful it happened now and there is no chance in hell i would ever give her a second of my time again. Sorry for the novel, it feels good to vent. Much Love.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Attempted to work on things with my gf, gave serious effort and understanding to her. Felt I was being treated very poorly in regards to that and got suspicious of her actions. Caught her on a date with another guy. Broke up with her on the spot, blocked her on everything, moving on.

Edit: I really appreciate all the positive response  and feedback I've gotten here. As well as all the insightful messages I've received. I am doing my best to respond to everyone who has taken the time to give me their input, positive or negative. Thank you

Edit 2: For the people responding thinking I was making assumptions about the situation i walked up on that night, and defending that it could have been just a friend. Let me explain that there was no way it was not what it looked like. I did not include the whole dialogue exchange between us, but the guy did make it clear he was under the impression they were on a date. Which is when i walked away because it definitely contradicted her whole made up story.",relationship_advice
the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action [TX],"When I was 14, I was raped by a close family friend. I got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when I was 15. I knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but I did not know their names or what they were like. We received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. I do not remember signing anything.  I do not know what happened to the friend; I asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. My mother said he was jailed but I don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. I  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. My husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200B;

A month ago, I received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. I believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. She told me that she wanted to get to know me. I spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. I found myself disgusted by her. There are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. She is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. I decided that I would not be comfortable meeting her. I blocked her without responding. After a week, I began to receive letters from her. Four letters in total. I did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. I finally answered. I told her that I was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or I would get the police involved.

&#x200B;

She  began to berate me. She told me  that my family was her family. She accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that I had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that I had held back important information. Without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  She told me that she would be making contact with my family whether I liked it or not. She also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if I did not comply and that I could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. When I began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. If I agreed to pay for a round of IVF, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. Here are my questions:

&#x200B;

1. Does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if I tell her to stay away?
2. Could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. My parents are dead and I do not know how to find out information about the adoption. I did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. I am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. Could I be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. I have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. Could I form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if I agreed to pay?

Edit: amount asked for was removed. Also, because several people have asked: I do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. It only stopped once I left the state. I am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and I will need to move again.  ",legaladvice

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""Sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",relationship_advice

AITA for showering my niece?,"Obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. Also a heads up I personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what I actually did wrong. 

So last weekend I  [25M] was watching my niece [3F]. I have a daughter [5F] myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. On this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. Okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. What was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. Seriously I went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when I came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. I immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. I helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while I washed hers. 

I thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly I didn't even think twice about doing it. My SIL does not agree. She keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that I should've called her to okay it first. That mindset is kinda confusing to me. Like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who I always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, what was I supposed to do? Let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? However, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when I'm a man and not her dad. Are they right and I'm missing the point or am I right that there's nothing weird about it?

ETA: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so I'll address them. 

1. My daughter's mother is dead and I'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. Idk if my SIL was abused. Will throw out there though that I was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and I as kids.

3. I was *NOT* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think I was. I never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. Yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

5. Thanks whoever gave me silver.",AmItheAsshole

Hello everyone, I said that I'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response I got yesterday. In many ways, I was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but I found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. Thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200B;

I spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. He basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. We had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning I went back to the flat and confronted her. She was there (neither I nor her work on Saturdays), and I set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner I could.

&#x200B;

 Basically, I said that I didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. The wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. She basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". Look, I'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. I basically said that over the weekend I'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (I'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . Towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but I stood my ground and didn't change my course. Not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200B;

I left, and there is nothing much more to say really. As I type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). I'll be grand, being totally frank I feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  The coming days I'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"". ",relationship_advice
AITA for teasing my wife about finally catching her shitting?,"Ok so this is kind of a weird situation. My wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, ""See! I knew you shit too!"" She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again.

Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

"AITA for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiancé that I cheated 9 years ago?","For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fiancé Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

Connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

We all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement ""Never Have I Ever cheated before"" came up.

Now's a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fiancé cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

Well my brother knows about this so when I didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). You have to drink to that!""

My boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. I'm numb. I'm heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don't know how I'm going to move on.

Connor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. I just can't look at him right now. He ruined my life.

AITA for allowing the girls on my HS track team (I'm the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?;,"This is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because I'm honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. I just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that I have to be in his office Monday morning and I'm scared shitless. 

Basically I just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. The school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so I volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. We have some very talented girls and I enjoy it. 

We were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. On Monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. They argued it was for thier comfort since it's about 80 here today. I was a little nervous but agreed. Apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. I'm so naive I thought initially people were just being charitable but when I saw boys from surrounding schools I knew somthing was up. And it wasn't long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. The girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. 

Parents are furious with me and obviously it's gone up the chain. I'm hoping to god I can chalk this up to my inexperience and I'm not fired buf when I had a 6'4"" dad screaming in my face that he's going to get my fired...I'm scared. 

Am I the asshole for allowing this?

She said all I have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. I told her I can't do that. For one, I'm trying to get my nursing degree and I don't want anything to slow me down. And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there's no way I want to go through it again so soon. I'm also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it's still in the womb. I don't want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won't be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me ""it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me"". She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn't deprive her of it when I can help her so easily.

Dumped before Valentine's Day,"So.... It's 11:09pm on February 13th. Less than an hour until Valentine's Day. And my boyfriend of 7 years, who I had big plans with for tomorrow, just texted me out of nowhere and said our relationship is over. No explanation, nothing. Then he blocked my number and all social media accounts. Needless to say, I'm super confused and completely devastated. How am I supposed to survive Valentine's Day? It's always been our day. We've always done something big and extravagant because Valentine's day is our anniversary. And I just feel crushed. Some people have suggested I have a girls night, but I don't have really any friends that live near me. And I really don't want to have a night to myself, it just feels so cold and lonely. Any advice?

Edit: forgot to mention, not that it's super important to this specific situation, but him and I have a 2 year old son together. So it's not just me that this is going to effect, it's going to impact our son's life too.

Edit 2: A lot of people are asking our ages and why we don't live together. I'm 20 years old, he's 22 years old. And we don't live together because we were given an eviction notice a few days before Christmas telling us we had to vacate the premises by January 1st. It was such short notice, and right at Christmas time, we had absolutely no money for a new apartment so we moved in with my parents. He lasted about 2 weeks in my parents house before deciding he couldn't live with them, he said it made him feel uncomfortable. So he moved back home with his family, almost 2 hours away from me and our son.

Edit 3: My son was only in this post so people could understand that I'm not just being a whiny bitch because I got dumped. I'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. And please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. That was my decision, not yours. Oh, and just so you assholes that were harassing me for getting evicted know, we didn't get evicted for not paying our rent. We got evicted because he invited friends over and they were smoking weed in the apartment whenever my son and I weren't around. We live in NY where weed isn't legal, so honestly he's lucky we only got evicted and he didn't end up in jail or worse, we lose our kid.

WIBTA if I ended my friendship with my best friend who is gay?,"Alright, hear me out, because I know how this sounds. I (22M) have been best friends with ""John"" (22M) for about 6 years. We always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but I never really thought much of it. About 5 months ago, John came out to me and I was completely supportive, but to be honest I started to consider some of his actions in a new light. 

For example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. I am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. Also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if I ever spend time with a girl over him. He always says things like ""you don't care about me anymore!"", seemingly just to get me to say that I do. It's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly I am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.

I told him about a month ago that I would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. He was upset, and again it was about how I am trying to push him away. We haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that I addressed.

I feel like I can't put up with this anymore. I want it to be clear that I have **no issue** with him being gay, but I would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.

AITA for mentioning that I had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor?,"I'm posting this from my wife's account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I'm the asshole. 

This is a topic we've been debating for the past almost two years now. It'd be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

My perspective (husband):

My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. 

After eating something delicious, I can't quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I'm talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn't want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife's contractions started to pick up. 

Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

Wife's perspective:

My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he'd complain I'd say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn't in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. 

I'd like to also mention it wasn't just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours.

She had texted me the next morning saying that her wireless keyboard had stopped working as well. We had already planned for me to stay the night at her place after I got off work, so I offered to stop by my place on the way to grab her a keyboard, as I have a few extras.

&nbsp;

When I got to her place, she was eagerly awaiting the keyboard, which makes sense, as she wasn't able to use her computer for most of the day. But when I handed her the keyboard, she started getting really quiet and pouty. A bit later, when I asked her what was wrong, she said she thought I'd be bringing her something nicer, like the keyboard I have at my desk.

&nbsp;

The thing is, I have a really nice keyboard at my desk. I'm a programmer, and I love this keyboard so much that I also bring it to work with me. I even have specific macro profiles for it that definitely improve my workflow.

&nbsp; 

For context, I had an extra Amazon Basics keyboard  (~$15) lying around, still brand new in the box. My personal keyboard, which I've had for years, is some variant of the Razer Blackwidow (~$120).

&nbsp; 

Anyway, she was apparently expecting me to be 'selfless' and let her use my nice keyboard while I used the Amazon keyboard. She was upset that I didn't ""value her enough"" to lend her my nice posessions, and left her with the ""cheap $10 keyboard"" (her words). She said if the situation was reversed, she'd lend me the nice keyboard. I explained to her that I have my keyboard specifically set up for work, and because I'm so used to it, it would hinder my ability to do work if I didn't have it.

 &nbsp;

We continued to argue about it. Things really came to a head when she boldly claimed that if I wasn't willing to lend her my nice keyboard, that I ""should have bought her a nice new keyboard if I really cared about her."" This is when I got really mad. I told her she was acting like an entitled, spoiled child and that she should have been grateful that I went out of my way in the first place to grab her the Amazon keyboard. She started crying and asked me to go home. I left, but I still gave her the Amazon keyboard to use. **I was far more upset at the principle of the situation than the keyboard itself.**

&nbsp;

So now she's calling me an asshole for both not giving her my keyboard AND because I called her spoiled. We're going to meet up tomorrow to talk about this in person because I refused to continue this silly argument over text.

&nbsp;

I'm thinking about ending things with her, as I feel like this is her showing me her true colors.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: GFs keyboard broke. I lent her one of my extras, and she got upset that it was a 'cheap' keyboard. I called her spoiled, which infuriated her.

&nbsp;

**EDIT:** She texted me asking to meet up tonight instead of tomorrow, as she is feeling anxious and stressed about the situation. **I will give everyone an update later tonight or tomorrow morning.**


&nbsp; 

I also wanted to clarify that she's never acted like this before (although, admittedly, we haven't been together for very long). Some of you suggested that maybe I'm not making her feel 'valued' and this situation is a symptom of that. While I think I both show AND tell her that she's valued in different ways, this may be something I bring up with her. It, of course, doesn't forgive her behavior, but may explain some of it.  Cheers.

Can you wish me a happy birthday?,"Very few of my friends wished me a happy birthday this morning (in Australia), and I want to feel loved, and if complete strangers are the only other people that might help, so be it. I turned 15 today. Thanks!

Small breasts are infinitely better than huge fake breasts.,"Fake breasts look like they're...fake. They rarely look good. Even the best jobs still look bad. Most look like half volleyballs taped to the chest. They they maintain their shape when the woman lays on her back. They only look semi convincing when the woman is fully clothed. Every time I see them in a porn it's a turn off too. Bottom line, ladies, natural breasts, no matter their size and shape, are better and much sexier.

Disclaimer, I realize women can do whatever they want with their body. Nobody is telling you not to here so please don't lecture me about that shit. Remember, this is just an opinion.

Edit: I feel I need to put out a couple disclaimers here.
1. I realize, to some, this isn't ""unpopular"" but I felt it was enough so to make this post. There are enough women getting it done and not having it turn out the best.
2. Yes, big naturals are good as well. My intent was to give an example of an extreme opposite to show preference.
3. I am perfectly aware women's breasts aren't made for my pleasure but there is something to be said about WHY augmentation is done for vanity...and yes I am also aware of there being other reasons a woman may have fake breasts other than vanity.

AITA for sending my son to school in a dress,"My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

He's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said ""I want to wear this."" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

I figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

I drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

My wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

At the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. AITA",AmItheAsshole

"[Update] My neighbor falsely believes my disabled BIL was being creepy, and I want to protect him.","Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9hm58g/my_neighbor_falsely_believes_my_disabled_bil_was/

Hi, all. Sorry for never replying to everybody's really kind, helpful advice -- I'm bad at reddit and really busy right now. I really do appreciate it.

For a few days after my initial post, my husband or I would walk my BIL to his usual spot after work and watch from a distance to make sure he wasn't behaving inappropriately (he might have by accident). Neither of us saw him do anything out of the ordinary; he just sat on the bench, took pictures, and looked around at the trees and flowers. He didn't watch or interact with anybody else, which is about what we expected. He's so, so shy.

Per a lot of advice, I didn't delete any of my BIL's photos for awhile. This pretty quickly got to be unmanageable though, because he takes 50-100 pictures every day, often just the same thing again and again. But we set up a google drive to save them all. 

My husband and I also talked to BIL a LOT about what to do/say if he is approached by police. He is not very verbal and very quickly gets flustered and upset in unfamiliar social situations, so we really practiced pulling out his medical alert card and being very ""non-threatening"" with his body language (my BIL is 6'5"" but has physical mannerisms a little bit like a child's, so if you don't know him or why he's behaving the way he is, he can be pretty alarming). To be honest, I'm still nervous about it, but we practiced and talked about it a lot.

As for my neighbor, I saw her again a few times and she ignored me. I considered bringing my BIL to meet her properly, but decided I didn't want to expose him to her freaking out. About a week ago, she approached me and told me she appreciated my ""taking control of the situation,"" but that my BIL's disability was ""no excuse."" I said ""No excuse for what?"" and she said ""for filming and photographing children."" I considered pointing out that it isn't illegal to do that (as you guys did), but that would sound like he IS doing it, so I just told her that she isn't doing that. She threatened to call the cops again but so far nothing's come of it. I'm keeping an eye out. In any case, it's getting colder, and my BIL is spending less time just hanging out. He's also really happy to come with me to doctor's appointments, and I'm currently pregnant, so we've had a lot of those. (My neighbor started saying something about how I'd understand if I was a mother. I'm not showing yet, but I really considered telling her I was pregnant just to shut her up. But that's needlessly combative, lol.)

Thanks again to everyone's kind advice. Husband and I are currently working with BIL on responses he should give if that neighbor/anybody else approaches him while he's nature-photographing.

Edit: This post got more traction than I was expecting. I'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where I am. I grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. From elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

They've had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. **It's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

Plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",LifeProTips

My (F 26) husband (27) acted crazy last night and choked me and now today he thinks everything is fine.,"My husband and I got into an argument the other night because I saw text notifications on his phone from her that literally said ""I haven't been with another man who's been as good as you were in bed lol"". It's even worse because he has cheated on me once before with her, but as far as I knew they haven't been talking recently. I asked him about it and he tried to brush it off but I was being jealous and insecure and I couldn't let it go. He walked away from me and told me ""I can't talk to you when you're like this"". I just cried alone in the living room and than after a while he called for me to ""come here"". I did and he pulled me onto his lap and told me to stop crying and he wiped my tears. He told me that he can't control what she says, and told me that he only loves me. He told me, ""she's not like you, I couldn't be with a girl like her"". I told him I was sorry and he nodded but than he just stopped smiling and freaked out on me all of a sudden. He pushed me onto my back on our bed and he put his hand around my throat and started choking me. He told me something like ""just a warning though, nobody likes a jealous woman babe"". I tried to put my hand on his to move it but he whispered ""don't be stupid"". He just stared at me until I surrendered and then he eased his grip. He told me, ""I don't want you to talk to me like that again, okay?"". I told him yes and he let go of me. And then he told me gently to take my clothes off. I said ""what?"". And he told me again to take them off but this time he tapped my throat with his finger and told me ""I don't like asking twice"". I just did what he said and I said sex with him. It wasn't angry sex or anything, he wasn't very rough. If anything he was more caring and passionate than usual. After that, he was nice to me the rest of the night and has been today. I just don't see how he acts like everything is fine when I have bruises on my neck. Maybe I'm being crazy but he just scared me. I just don't understand him. I know he shouldn't treat me like this.

I wanted to give y'all another update - hopefully the last one. It's been about a year since my original post, ten months since the first update.

&#x200B;

My ex did move out. Thankfully, moving day was uneventful, and then he was gone. And as many commentators predicted - when he was gone from the house it was a HUGE relief. I didn't have to cringe at every little sound anymore. I could BREATHE again. I was really, really sad - but my space was my own.

Aaaand then I got laid off. No joke. Helluva one-two punch right there.

The past two years have, on the whole, been incredibly painful. The year that my marriage fell apart, and then the year I had to spend recovering from that blow. I had to job hunt while mourning the death of my relationship, and as soon as I found a new job I also found out my house needed HUGELY expensive repairs that, after all of this mess as well as having supported my ex not working for a year, I just didn't have the cash for. And figuring out how to be on my own for a while - I had people there to support me, but in the day to day, hour to hour through this mess I was ultimately on my own, and that was hard. (Bingeing 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' helped a bit.)

He also kept reaching out. For a while it was occasionally chatty, but as time went on and I came more to terms with how he'd treated me, and how frequently his messages had a tinge of emotional manipulation to them, I distanced myself. He messaged me once to ask if I regretted our entire relationship, on the whole, or if I thought he was a terrible person, on the whole. I didn't respond to that one at all. Then he'd reach out with things like ""Hey, the TV I took from our living room broke, do you want it from me? Like to sell or try and fix?"" I've been doing my best to keep my responses short and clear, in ways that don't invite follow-up. Lately he's been wanting to have a post-mortem conversation, to which I said that I wouldn't be ready to consider whether or not that'd be a good idea until our legal ties were ended. (He also just messaged to ask if he could be my roommate, because his rent is really high. I have no words.)

&#x200B;

The good news - and there's thankfully quite a lot of it - the new job I got is possibly the best job I've ever had. A step down in salary, but I'm super happy with the work and the people and the location, and I've been getting rave reviews from coworkers and management, enough that I think I can probably negotiate a decent raise in a few months. I had to get a new car as well (new to me, but purchased used) since my ex got the car we shared in the split, and I was nervous about negotiating and buying a car by myself, which I'd never done before. But I did it - and managed to negotiate the dealer about $1k down - and I absolutely love the car.

Also - I met someone new. This person reminds me of my ex in a lot of ways - things like shared hobbies and creativity and sense of humor and charm - but very different in some really important ways. He treats me REALLY well. He's thoughtful and kind and generous - not just to me, but to everyone. In the conflicts we've had (very few) we are able to talk through them calmly - no yelling! - and he shows me how much he respects and cares about my perspective and boundaries and autonomy. He's not broken and doesn't need me to fix him - and I'm not broken either, thank god. Maybe carrying a bit of extra baggage, but such is life. This relationship is still new, but it feels like a game-changer for both of us, and I'm excited to see where it leads.

&#x200B;

And one more bit of good news - I will officially be divorced on Friday! (Yes, the day after Valentine's Day XD ) There are a few more loose ends to wrap up after that, but not many.

&#x200B;

I wanted to provide this update in part because I know it can be nice to see updates from folks, but also because I wanted to give a bit of hope to anyone who might be in a situation like mine. It can get better. It really, really can. I'm actually HAPPY. It took time and hard work, and things aren't perfect - I'm definitely going to need a LOT of time to recover financially, and I'm still sometimes processing the weight of 11 years of emotional abuse (A+++++ for therapy) - but I'm actually truly happy. Sometimes I wonder how much of the depression I'd been feeling before he left was the result of how much emotional weight I'd been carrying for so long - his AND mine - without truly being aware of it. It's so easy to feel like that dark tunnel is all there ever will be, when you're in the middle of it - but I'm out in the sunshine now, and it feels amazing.",relationship_advice
"TIFU by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""Freshly Squeezed Titty Juice""","The repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

My wife and I have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  We found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

While I was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional Asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  That rest was very short lived.  The baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

When she read ""Freshly Squeezed Titty Juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  She woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  Raised with no manners or respect.  She then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

My wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  She passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

I didn't get upset because I'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

TL;DR  I labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  Now I have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks I embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days.",tifu

I was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

She said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. 

I said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds.

Why was 6 afraid of 7?,"6 never did trust 7. Sure, they worked closely together, but 7 always seemed at odds with him. 6 always preferred the company of 4, a perfect 10 of a duo, even though 2 kept them apart.
But when it came to 7? 6 always summed it up to bad luck. Then, 6 found the truth.
6 respected 9, even though lewd jokes always seemed to be made about the two. 6 found that 3 and himself could come together and be seen as equal to 9. When 9 was removed, 6 had a very negative feeling.
Some were considered prime suspects in 9's death. 2, 3, 5, and 7. 6 knew it had to be 7. His involvement with 9 added up two well. 
6 snuck into 7's house. He looked up from the floorboards, and found himself under 7. An admittedly improper position for him, but 6 saw the proof he wanted: 9's body, half devoured. 7 was a cannibal... 7 8 9.
6 has spent the remainder of his days terrified of 7, worried that someday 7 will learn what 6 knows... And promptly solve his problem.",Jokes
TIFU by eating a free gumball.," 

I'm 23 years old, and I admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

Earlier today I was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. During that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, I thought I would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

I checked four candy dispensers; all empty. One last chance. I opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, I find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. Without any thought or inspection, I excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. At the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…Someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

So there I am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as I spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. I'm certain I looked ridiculous, and I'm still brushing my teeth.

WIBTA: If I refuse to get a flu shot to hang out with my GF's friends,"My gf wants to host a game night, but one of her friends has a newborn(4weeks old). The parents want everyone to have their flu shots before they bring the kid over. Maybe it's because I(30yr M) grew up before flu shots were a thing, but I don't feel that I should be required to have a shot to hang out with them. If they are worried about their kid they should get a sitter and leave him at home.

My gf got pissed and said I was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive and you can easily get them at a CVS. I am all about vaccinations, but I am not a fan of being told I need to do something for someone else's peace of mind.

Edit:

Quick edit, that I thought was obvious. I am not going to go if the baby will be there, and I don't have my shot. I don't want to get a baby sick/possibly die. I may still be the A\*\*hole, but I am not heartless.

Is it wrong of me to ask for proof of a pregnancy?,"My girlfriend [f28] and have been I [m21] a very rocky place in our relationship. I tried to break up with her a couple of weeks ago and she told me that she was pregnant, the day before this we went to bar crawl and both drank. She has displayed manipulative tendencies before and she freaks out calling me terrible for asking her to take a test. 

Am I in the wrong for wanting to see proof with my own eyes?

Update: She still has not taken a test, we had two scheduled before and she backed out, first with sending me bloody paper towels saying she's spotting. The day before the test she says there isn't a point to go anymore. 

A few days later she gets mad I don't give her a ride from her job saying, ""you're letting a pregnant woman take the bus?"" When I asked why she said there wasn't a point she replied, ""I didn't know if I wanted to keep it."" 

The second time I made an appointment but she said she wouldn't go because she hadn't heard of this place before. 

We have one this Saturday but we got into a bad argument last night because someone who messaged me claiming to be her husband said she was 35 not 28, when I confronted her she freaked out for a couple days then she admitted she was 35. This was a week ago and she gets mad I bring it up saying I make her feel terrible about her age. 

The man also sent some photo's including a fake pregnancy test box. She says he is out to ruin her life but he lived with for the first 5-6 months that we dated. 

Her biggest claim to not taking a pregnancy test that she had a miscarriage in Oct. When I was on a vaction. So she felt telling me or anyone would jinx it.

A big thing I would like to point out is I'm not perfect,  I can honestly claim to never have been a good boyfriend.

&#x200B;

Super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

I wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update: 

It's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

We spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

I was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

I apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

We then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

Up until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

If that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

My bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

In the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well. 

As for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

I think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

I mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",relationship_advice
AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?,"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.

I noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.",AmItheAsshole
"I [M26] recently found out my ""Step-Father"" [M48] who just married my mother 2 years ago is currently having a sexual relationship with my wife of 4 years [F28] behind my back and has been since late summer or maybe even before that. What am I supposed to do? Should I tell my mother?","I'm sorry if this is a little much. I've been sitting in my car for a few hours, sorry for errors im on mobile. 

My wife and I have been married for 4 years. We argue sometimes over little things but I love her with all my heart. There's never been anything wrong until now. I thought we were happy, I always treated her right and got listened to her. I took her out whenever she wanted and studied with her. She doesn't work because she's getting her degree right now, so I gladly pay for everything and work overtime constantly because I wanted her to be great. She goes to classes nearly full-time and spends the rest of her time home or her school library. 

I'm not close to my mother at all but I see her from time to time. Recently we've been trying to reconnect but she's just really not a good person. She was horrible to me growing up but I tried to forgive her for her personality and actions. She has alot of bad habits and had 2 failed marriages with really shitty dudes. She recently got remarried to another man 2 years ago, let's call him X. My mother invites me and my wife and It's the first time they all meet. Probably 4th time I've met him since they married fairly quickly. He seemed.. Okay. Just really didn't like his vibe too much. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt because at the end of the day it's her life, not mine and we aren't close.

Last year, X asks for help remodeling my mother's house for the day. My wife suggests we stay for the week and make it a bonding thing, I agreed. I thought we could all do things together but we ended up breaking into little teams. X and my wife really hit it off and I'm not very good with construction/renovation related things I ended up going out with my Mother a few times to eat in an attempt to bond with her. It was weird but we tried. My wife stayed behind and helped X remodel. Her family is really involved in the construction/engineering world so she knew much more than I about how to help fix the house up.  They seemed to really be close that week aka sharing jokes and laughing alot when I wasn't around and super animated conversations but I didn't think much of it because I assumed she was just being nice to my new ""Step Father."" I trusted my wife. 

She started going back over to my mother's house to help X out afterwards. They live almost an hour away so it's out if the way. I noticed when she'd be coming home way later than normal and decide to take the train instead of me pick her up. She kept saying library at first before she admitted to going there to help renovate since I wasn't ""much help"" in terms of helping my mom fix up the place. It was like once or twice a week. This started happening early this year. When the house was finished late spring, they kept hanging out which I didn't mind. I guess that makes me stupid. When her classes ended in summer we stopped spending as much time together but she made nothing seem wrong. She seemed happy, our sex life was the same, we were trying for a baby, everything was good even communication. I tried to go with her to my Mom's place but she was usually with her friends when she wasn't home and I didn't really like X's humor/mannerisms. I didn't mind, I worked alot and liked to be alone sometimes. 

A few weeks ago she got home late again and went to shower. I always joked that she'd use up all the cities water with how long she showered. She was in there a bit, probably 1am when her phone pings and vibrates. It does this like 4-5 times in a few minutes. I didn't wanna invade her privacy but that's very abnormal. I tapped her screen to see what it was and I recognized the number. It was X's. He sent multiple MMS messages with his face and nude pics of himself. There were replies from her with nude photos that were recent. Just alot of words I haven't processed yet. I took an extended screenshot of it, took a few minutes, and mailed it to myself and put the message on unread so she wouldn't know I saw. I really wish I didn't. I really would have honestly just not have known and kept everything perfect. There are MONTHS of texts, blocks of text and photos and heart emojis, I took a few days off work the following morning and flew down to see an old friend lives in the Midwest. He's hooking me up with a month to month studio no questions asked since we dont talk much anymore. She doesn't know I'm leaving in Jan which is when our lease is up. I told her it was a trip for work and she just smiled and told me to have fun and she'd miss me. I came back and she didn't seem any different. Our anniversary is the day before Christmas Eve.  I haven't told my mother, not sure how or if I want to. I haven't told anyone except you, reddit. I want to get out of here and be alone and think. 
 

It's been a while but I still haven't had the heart to go through all of the texts and photos. I feel like reading it all would make it all worse for me. I already feel broken and empty. I left my friends behind for her and started a life with her. I thought she was happy. We have been trying to get pregnant slightly before and around the time I found out and were supposed to go check in with the docs after the holidays. I need some time to think and I need to know how to fix this with my wife? How do I tell my mother? I love my wife with everything she's all I have I gave her everything these last 4+ years. I cant just  divorce, Im not going to follow in my mothers footsteps. 

I know it all seems outrageous given he's married to my mother but I don't have anyone else to talk to. I was supposed to be home 5 hours ago but I don't think i can lay next to her anymore. I've been forcing myself to try and get over it and hope it just goes away and it makes me feel more and more disgusted with myself. I'm probably gonna sleep in my car tonight. She's already called me 3 times and I'm just exhausted emotionally. It hurts ignoring her calls. I'll try to check back for any answers later tomorrow if I have the time. Im sorry if this post was a waste of your time but I hope you have advice.

I was breastfeeding, baby had colic, I was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. I do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and I was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).

My husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. He would silently be ticked if I asked him to not go to the gym. I truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). But sometimes, that ""help"" wasn't enough. Sometimes, I NEEDED another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. Example: one Saturday I got up to pump. They were both awake (8:00am). He said he was going to head to the gym since I was awake, and I started crying saying ""please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and I got maybe three hours or so of sleep"" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me ""sleep in."" I told him that it must be nice to even have the ENERGY to go to the gym. The ONLY thing I wanted to be able to do was sleep. I got the response ""I'm sorry you hate being a mom!""

Now that I'm pregnant again, I mentioned to him ""if I thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am I supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?"" I told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. Well, he did not receive this kindly. He texted me the next day ""Just to be clear, I feel like I do a lot. I will not be able to help out with daycare, as I drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. I will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and I need to go to relieve stress. The reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while I think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored. You need to think about if you want this baby. ""

I fucking lost it.

I said ""I cannot believe you would rather me have an abortion than make any more sacrifices regarding your gym time."" But he is adamant that I am the selfish one

ETA: I work full time when not on maternity leave (6-8 weeks)

ETA: People seem to think I'm bitter because I'm out of shape, and that's not true. I am a runner and try to run at least 15-20 miles a week (on my own time, immediately after work while my daughter is still in daycare). 

ETA: He left work early today to get his work out in so he could be home with us this evening. He picked up dinner, helped feed the baby, played with her outside & is giving her a bath now.

Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years. Last night she had some friends over after she finished work. I work from home so I only left my office to be formal and say hello and continued working. It was easy to hear the conversations they were having eventhough my office is down the hall. I then heard my girlfriend mention that she would leave me for a taller man.Her friends made a comment on how I was a lot shorter than her ex boyfriend. My gf responded:

""If only he was as tall as [ex] he'd be 10 times better, If I could find someone taller than him, I would.""

I guess I should mention my gf is barely 4'11 in shoes. I'm 5'9. The issue isn't the height, but the fact that she would leave me for something so trivial. I talked to her about it since and said she didn't mean anything by it, just that she always dated taller men. She has since apologized multiple times.

Is this a red flag of any kind of things to come or is it just me over thinking?

UPDATE: I didn't feel the need to make an entire different post for the update so here it is:

I left early in the morning to make sure I wasn't making irrational choices. When I came back she was immideatly apolegetic, but I didn't want any more apologies. I talked to her about how little respect she had for me that she felt the need to make jokes at my expense. She started crying and begging not to break up and feeding me the standard bs people say when they don't want to break up.

To not bore you with the details, I broke it off. I lose nothing at this point. 

I should clarify something from my initial post. I get that people can joke around and it doesn't mean anything, but when I confronted her about she denied it and got very defensive. That's the part that got to me. The fact that she tried to cover it up before apologizing.

I read all the comments and thank you.",relationship_advice

Neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. It was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. How can I proceed legall?,"Long story short, I live in NY. My bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. I had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. Those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. This lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) I came home to my wood missing and I found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. Someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. I contacted the guy, and got it back. I then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the NY State Government Property Lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. I told her to never do that again and mind her own business. Her response was ""I am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. Good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" After that passive aggressive bullshit I went to the police. I filed for tresspassing. The cop said I could get her for possible larceny. Idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. I'm just wondering... how far can I push this? I am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town I live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. The cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... I have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people I didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that I had posted on my own FB that I was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. I work as a bartender in town, where I have many strange men I dont want knowing where I live. She posted it to my towns Facebook page. Maybe if she was more kind I would have let bygons be bygons but now, I'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear""",legaladvice
TIFU by not openning a gift for 1.5 years,"This actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. I was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. We got on well and I was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country I decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. I thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so I kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

In the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. It was all a blur but I kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what I think. Well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided NOT to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). We met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but I was prepared and considered that was it.

The box stayed in my fridge for I dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? She went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and I also met somebody else. One day I was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. Chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously I still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then I saw a full page note from her. She basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

I just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. I probably looked like an asshole for how I acted when I last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am I..

TL;DR: Got a gift from a girl I really liked but decided not to open it after 1.5 years, totally ignoring her note for me hidden inside.",tifu

AITA for being cold to my ex-fiancé and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?,"So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.

I knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

These past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.

Suffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.

I've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to ""Reconcile"" i've shut it down,

My friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",AmItheAsshole

I got home late last night and the posts were still there so after walking my dog I called the police non-emergency line again and they said they'd send a car out early in the morning. 

I'm working from home today and sure enough around 8am a cop car pulled up to my neighbors house.  Two officers stepped out and kicked around his front yard where the posts were before going up to knock on his door.  There was about a 5 minute discussion where my neighbor looked quite agitated (couldn't hear what was said) but he came out with some gloves on and pulled all the posts out while the cops watched and he seemed to be shouting at them.  The officers took the posts then one handed him something (not sure if a citation, pamphlet, or something else) and drove away.  Neighbor left for work in a huff about 30 mins later.

Not sure if it's the last thing the neighbor will try but at least that hazard is gone.  Thanks to everyone for the advice.    ",legaladvice
I found my husbands secret Reddit account where he has PMed girls from gone wild... I feel like this is cheating? Me F29/ him M31 - located in North America,"This is my first time posting here and I'm on mobile. I'm sorry if I make any mistakes. 

My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1, friends for 14 (we met in high school.). We were out at an event on Friday night and my phone died while he was busy for two hours so I started browsing Reddit using his phone. My thumb print is programmed into his phone and it isn't unusual for us to use each others phones. 

When I opened his app the entire front page was filled with nsfw content/subs so I looked at the profiles and saw that he was logged into a secondary account used only for porn. I have no problem with porn - in fact we frequently watch it together. I saw his user name and scrolled through a page of comments when he came over to check on me. I quickly closed the app and when I saw him - I'm not sure why.. I think I felt so shocked I didn't want to tell him I'd seen? 

He took his phone from me and while he had it he logged out of that account and gave me back his phone. 

Later that night from my own Reddit account I searched his user name and found hundreds of messages on gonewild subs but also subs for specific girls. His comments were mostly compliments to body types that don't really match with mine. A few girls had posted fantasies about making videos with men while they do xyz or exchanging Snapchat videos. He posted ""I've PMed you"". One of those posts was just before our wedding. 

Four years ago he posted on an askreddit thread titled ""Reddit have you ever met a psychopath?""  He commented ""I may be dating one now. Wait a couple months and I'll let you know"" we had been together two years at that point. But I don't know context - if we'd had a fight or what?

He had an important work event tonight that he was really stressed about so I haven't brought it up yet. I feel sick to my stomach and I haven't slept at all. We've been trying to have a baby and I just can't imagine continuing to sleep with him when I'm feeling so undesirable. 

Am I overreacting? Is this cheating? How do I talk to him about this? I've never felt worse about myself or my body. 

TL;DR - without intending to snoop I stumbled upon my husbands porn Reddit account and he's been messaging people in a way that feels like cheating to me. ",relationship_advice
My dog attacked a man that got in my car (MI),"   Sorry I'm not sure what to mark that is. I'm from Michigan. Sorry for the wall of text 
 
I was sitting at a gas station waiting for my cousin to come out the store with my dog in the back seat(Husky if that's important). This man walks out and he was obviously intoxicated(i later found out from my cousin that the store owners wouldn't sell to him because of how Intoxicated he was). The man starts walking towards my car and i reach over to lock my doors, the man opens my door before I get a chance to lock it and sits down in back seat and then closes the door. 
   
 At first I'm calm and ask him politely to get out of my car, the man just smiles at me before locking the door(using the little door lock thing). While I'm talking to the man my dog starts growling at him, i think he sensed that i was frightened.I jump out of my car and start screaming at him to get the fuck out of my car, shoo go away, this isn't your car, go away, etc. The guy doesn't get out and shoved my dog away from him(he was growling) and then my dog starts to attack him. My dog bit him 4 times before I was able to open the back door and pull him off.

   The man gets out my car, calls the police, etc. They said they will call me, this was earlier today. My dog has NEVER shown any signs of aggression and I have multiple people that can vouch for that. 

How much trouble am I in?

TIFU by accidentally making my friend's parents think I was having lesbian sex with their daughter,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but I was talking to my friend and remembered about this whole ordeal and thought I'd share.

This happened a few months ago, and for context, me and my friend are both 17 and female, and importantly one of our female friends had just come out as gay at the time. This meant that my other friend (the one who this is about, who I'll call H) had told her parents that one of her female friends was gay, but hadn't specified which one (important later).

So one day H invited me over to watch a film after school. When I arrived I said hi to her parents then went upstairs with H to her bedroom to watch the film. This is where the fuck up slowly started. First of all we closed the door, which is something that we never do when I visit her, but was important as we were watching a film and didn't want to be disturbed by her parents. Then we turned the light out, again, uncharacteristic for us but important for watching a film. We really didn't think much about either of these things.

Anyway, an hour later we were talking and laughing with the film in the background. Now this is where I really fucked up, I was being uncharacteristically funny and was talking in a kinda flirty, sexual voice which one of the characters in the film had sounded like. H found this really funny so I continued with it and only spoke with that voice for a good 10 minutes or so, and we were both quietly laughing a lot. At some point during this time I heard her parents walk past the door but neither of us though much about it. Some more important information to know is that H is asexual (meaning that she doesn't experience sexual attraction and doesn't want to have sex), and her parents don't know this about her because she doesn't like to talk to them about that kind of thing. This means that I constantly forget that most people don't know this about her.

Another 20 mins past and then we heard footsteps and soft knocking on the door. We thought this was strange as they're the kind of parents to barge into a room without announcing their presence. H shouted at them to just come in the room and then we heard the sliding of paper under the door. We were very confused and just watched this piece of paper awkwardly sliding and then heard footsteps walking away. H picked up the paper and it said ""we're going to get McDonalds for dinner do you want anything?"".

We were both seriously confused about why they had felt the need to tell us via paper, in such an awkward way rather than just opening the door to ask. Then it dawned on me and I turned to H and asked her ""Do your parents think we were fucking?"", at first she looked at me with a look of confused disgust, wondering why the hell I had said that, then slowly her expression turned to that of horror and realisation. We had closed to door, turned of the lights, had been quietly giggling, I had been talking in a flirty voice for an extended period of time... Not to mention the fact that neither one of us can sit still for more than 10 seconds so there had certainly been lots of bed creaking and sheet rustling sounds. Also her parents knew that one of her two female friends was gay just didn't know which one it was, and didn't know that their daughter was asexual so would never want to have sex anyway.

We immediately turned the lights on and opened the door, but by then it was too late. When we went downstairs to say what we wanted from McDonald's her parents couldn't look either one of us in the eye, and were talking to us really awkwardly. After the McDonalds I left and H spent a lot of time subtly clearing it up with her parents, such as mentioning the name of the friend who was gay, and bringing up that I had a boyfriend (which her parents didn't know about). I think they realised that they had got it wrong but those moments of awkwardness were horrific. Luckily all has been fine since, but now whenever we meet up we make sure to keep the door open.

TL;DR Went round to a female friend's house to watch a film, we did a series of uncharacteristic stuff that led her parents to believe that we were having sex... Now when we meet up we keep her bedroom door open.",tifu

WIBTA for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?,"My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn't the issue... it's her behavior; she acts very entitled & she's lying left & right. I just don't feel now is the right time for a Switch.

The theft: 

On Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband's aunt & uncle's house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we'll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn't get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

Well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

My kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle's by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.

Due to Cousin's challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It's one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

I'm disappointed about the thievery, but I'm even more upset over my kid's attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn't until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. 

I feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter's help from money she would ""earn"" by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

I mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don't really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?

Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

Also - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***Edit: I'll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I'm TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her ""no"" to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",AmItheAsshole

"(AZ) Our neighbors dog was poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). Wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. I say absolutely not. How should we proceed?","I guess some background is in order here. Earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. We were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 Our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. The next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. They did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. The next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. This all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

So they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. We tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

So we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. We have yet to contact the lawyer. 

We had made the initial report to animal control last Thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" I was really taken aback and I think I asked ""I think so, do you need some?"" 

He then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. I literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. I explained that I actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and I really have no way of knowing which dog is which). He said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" I got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


The officer then asked if he could take everything. I said I wasn't comfortable with that but I would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. I did exactly this. I was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. Again I was taken completely aback and said that I'm not sure what he'd be looking for. He told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. It took me as second but I asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. I asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if I remember) ""not yet."" 
I asked him if I could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. I said I would really rather not but I would get back in touch with him. He gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

I just got home and told my wife. My wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. We have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but I feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

She thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. I say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. I'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

Thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. Wife thinks we should let them, I say absolutely not.

TIFU by finding my GF's porn videos and confronting her about it,"This actually did happen today and I'm still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.


Basically me and my GF of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. We're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. Long Distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like Catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. Fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. Great right? Wrong.


Last night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. I went home with blue balls, and decided that I was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. After going in and out of sleep, I eventually decided that I needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.


I loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until I found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. I got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. The girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. Exactly like my girlfriend. I was thinking ""Oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes"", and began to jack it.


But once the fucking started, my heart stopped. She had the same birthmark as my GF did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. This wasn't a look alike, this WAS my girlfriend. I grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.


I checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. I was hesitant, but clicked on it. Turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen I was looking at page after page, video after video of my GF being railed by giant porn dicks. My girl wasn't as innocent as I thought. She was a porn starlet.


I was so fucking torn right then. So many feelings started running through my brain. It now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. She was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.


I then started freaking out about STDs. None of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. We were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now I was terrified I had been duped. Not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. I realized that it was late enough that I couldn't do anything so I went to bed again.


I woke up the next morning in cold sweats. I was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. I sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book I could think of. I called up my doctor's office and scheduled an STD test. Fortunately they could take me right then so I drove over. 


After the tests were finished, I got a text from my girlfriend. ""What the fuck are you talking about???"". I was even angrier than before. That little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  I was furious, but I had evidence. She wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining. 


I fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but I couldn't find the casting one I started on last night. No worries, I remember her stage name. I typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what I found. Not because I was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. They didn't exist.


Now I was just fucking confused. I tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. I knew I saw them last night tho, so I knew they were there though, right?


And that's when the realization hit. Remember how I said I was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? It was all a dream. A very bad dream. My brain decided that a great dream to have would be my Girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.


So here I am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how I had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names I called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. Fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so I think we're good for now.


TL;DR: Had a very realistic dream that my GF was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a Doctors office taking STD tests for diseases I don't have.


Edit: OK Holy shit this blew up overnight. I can't reply to most of the comments/questions/concerns so I'll try to break it down by groups that I see most frequently commenting.


For everyone saying the relationship is done: Surprisingly not. She took it pretty well and were talking this through pretty openly. I'm gonna go over later tonight in person just to make sure, but it hasn't gone nearly as bad as I thought it would.


For the conspiracy theorist: Nah, the videos don't exist. She didn't pull them or anything, there were enough videos that on a normal PH page there would definitely be at least one re upload. I checked my browser history, nothing there, and nothing is ever deleted on the internet, and I trust my GF so I'm fine on that note.


For the ""YTA"" crowd: Yeah I know that's why this is on TIFU and not on wholesome stuff or smthn.


For the ""sex work is real work, you're just misogynistic"" crowd: Sex work is a real job and I'm not contesting that. I also don't care if my partners body count is as long as Troy Polamalu's hair, or as short as OJ Simpsons prison sentence. What I got mad at was that she was CURRENTLY banging dudes without my knowledge, breaching my trust of her, and crossing a deal breaker for me. Obviously it never happened but that was what I was mad at, not anything else.


For everyone getting mad at me for not knowing how porn STD tests work: thanks. Now I know I guess?

I [34M] just discovered the real side of my girlfriend [33F],"We had no issues before, and she was my role-model. I'm honestly shocked by this.

Yesterday I got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the TV and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around Christmas time.

After a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating Christmas dinner. My girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""Look at that crap dinner."" I didn't really react to her comment.

The mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""That looks like cow's placenta."" that's when I sat up and said ""Are you serious?""

I told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" Christmas dinner, I told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

Then she said something along the lines of: ""Yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on Christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

That was when I lost my shit and just went home. I haven't talked to her since. I'm contemplating whether to stay with her anymore.

Any advice appreciated.",relationship_advice
AITA for 'forcing' my son to be a father after he got a girl pregnant?,"My son is 21 years old and got a girl from work pregnant. Needless to say, I am incredibly disappointed in him and when he told me I was devastated he'd make such a silly mistake. I asked him about an abortion and he broke down and told me he'd worn a condom and he was hoping she'd abort but to no avail. 

I have met the future mother of my grandchild in a very awkward meeting one day and it's clear to me she's a lovely young lady. However I found out from her (not even my coward son) that he has broken all ties with her and plans only to give child support and not see this baby at all. 

I have been texting her and trying to assuage her worries but she is also understandably worried that she won't have any support and that her baby- my first grandchild- won't have its father. Obviously I am very much wanting to be in this child's life also.

Of course I have been trying to speak to my son over and over about this issue and I keep telling him that the deed is done and he needs to just deal with it now. He told me in tears that he never wanted to be a father and he wore protection, as well as the fact they were casual lovers and nothing more. I told him I would withdraw all financial assistance if he wasn't in this babies life and he told me if that was the case then so be it, so I took his car and phone and bank cards that were attached to my account. 

In response to this, he's moved in with his father but I have no idea where he lives and he's not even attempted once to contact me. He told me he was leaving and that I wasn't supporting him. My own parents are vehemently against him leaving and have said they'll disown him if he doesn't come back. 

My partner of 12 years however is very much on my sons side and has told me that he's disappointed in how I'm handling this.

"Sheriff's deputy is renting from me, refuses to remove his dog and is now making threats (Texas)","I own and manage a small apartment building (6 units).  One is for my family, one is for my in-laws, and the other 4 are rented to paying tenants.  

Our lease clearly says no pets are allowed except service dogs.  However, one of my tenants, who happens to be a sheriff's deputy, obtained two small dogs (I believe they are chihuahuas) last month.  My in-laws, who live next to them, started complaining about barking.  So I sent them a notice saying they have 30 days to either rehome the dogs, or they can end their lease if they desire.  

He texted me and said can we meet to discuss this situation.  So I said sure, come over to my apartment.  I thought he was going to claim they are service dogs or something.  But when he came over, he was in normal non-uniform clothes, but wearing his gun.  He walked into my apartment and said something like this: look, I don't really care what the lease says, my wife got these dogs and I'm not going to make her remove them.  I said I'm sorry it doesn't work that way, you have to follow the lease.  Then he put his hand on his gun, and said if you want to make an issue of this, there will be serious consequences.  I was kind of shocked and didn't say anything, and he left.  

Now I'm not really sure what to do, to be honest I don't feel safe with him around, but I don't want to piss him off and cause problems for myself either.  If anyone has any advice please tell me how to proceed.",legaladvice
Amy Schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail [see below],"EDIT: Thanks for the awards. I hope this post can raise some awareness.

In a [speech Schumer gave](https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  Ms. Foundation for Women's Gloria Awards and Gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""And then came the sex, and I use that word very loosely. His penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". Sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

Amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. In this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UrhXqRq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), Amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. The host says ""so you raped a guy"" at [11:12](https://youtu.be/8UrhXqRq2_4?t=670) and Amy replies ""yeah I know. When I tell this story I say I let a cab driver finger me but really I took his hand...\[sic\]"". If the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this TWICE, he'd be in jail after public outrage. Why the double standards.

TIFU by giving a homeless guy $80,"Preface: 
*Not trolling for money, thanks* 


So I'm a semi-broke grad student and Lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. I ran into CVS to grab something and I was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). I also paid in cash which I never do as I rarely carry cash. So I walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man I often see in my neighborhood. I give him a dollar here or there some days when I can. He's in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so I figure, hey, even though I'm broke (as in my bills are insane and I make just enough atm to live and support my family) I can still give my coat because I have a few decent ones, I'm dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so I give him the coat and he mumbles ""thanks"" and I smile and tell him to stay warm and off I go... later as I'm working I stop to grab gas and realize I put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. I would never go ask for it back (obviously) but I had a moment of semi- panic before I accepted that I just gave this dude all that money. Best ""screw up"" ever, I suppose. I'll live. I have to be totally honest and say I was upset at first but I'll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that I should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke I FEEL.

AITA for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?,"I was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. At a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

As I was near, I rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

When she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me I'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

I said ok, I just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" I dont need your help"", again super angry. 

I wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but I was the first one, cause I was sitting right by the restroom

Cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. Then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

She couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. So another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

The barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if I could help and I said "" I was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, I'm good"".

I kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

They all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

Am I the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

TIFU by looking up my school bully,"So a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when I was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. I struggled like hell because I didn't speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. So that's he kind of person I'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can't be that unfair. 

Fast forward 15 years. I haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn't make any friends and I didn't develop Stockholm's. I looked him up on Facebook. 

He owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can't get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed.

AITA for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?,"Throwaway because my sister knows my Reddit. 

I'm getting married next year and I'm so excited about it. My fiancé has all his groomsmen picked out, and I'm in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I'd also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I'm sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. 

I drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he'd be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said ""Will you be a part of my Bride Tribe?"", deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E's ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.

Fast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E's reaction didn't go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to ""fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold"" despite his transition. I tried to explain that I'd picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn't get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me ""basic"" and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.

I guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he'd be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he's still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it's best if he isn't a part of the bridal party. My fiancé says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I'm being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. She says I should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. She says I should give E a second chance and if I don't it will cause all kinds of family drama.

Would I be the asshole if I refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

ETA: 
Wow, I cannot believe how much this blew up. So I'm going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

E sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for ""snapping at me"". He admitted he was wrong and it was ""totally out of line"" and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party ""if I'd have him"". Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven't sent any response yet. 

A also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

ALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E.",AmItheAsshole
Employer forcing us to pay for parking that we don't use.,"My wife and I work for a hospital (Ontario, Canada) which has just implemented a policy that all staff will pay for a monthly parking pass at the main campus of the hospital. This will cost us approximately $1000 per year.

My wife and I both work off site, where parking is free. Also another couple that we know that works for the hospital only owns one car, yet both are expected to pay the monthly parking fee, and others we know walk or take the bus to work also have to pay for a monthly parking pass. 

This seems like robbery to me... It has nothing to do with standards of practice (like wearing scrubs), and driving is not an essential part of job duties for most at the hospital.

AITA for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request),"**Edit:** Well fuck me I just spoke with my maid. She says she hasn't seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she's never seen before. From her description I've never heard of him either. She kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. 

I guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. So before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. Honestly thought my marriage was perfect I never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

My wife and I have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. My wife is a stay at home mom while I work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

We live in Hong Kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. Our maid is a 34 year old Filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. She lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

The problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. She hasn't given any specific reason other than ""I don't want a maid anymore."" I honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but I don't want to fire her because:

- She has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- She relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- We still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- I work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. My wife doesn't cook nor clean so I am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

The woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and I don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

I'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. Jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

I [59M] cut two of my kids [24F][28M] out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. How should I fix this situation?,"My (now deceased) ex-wife and I have 5 kids together: 21F, 24F, 28M, 30M, 35M.

A few years ago their mother passed away and left each of them a very large inheritance. Over 300K GBP each, evenly distributed among them.

Prior to her passing she made it clear to them that this money was not to be wasted. It was to: 1. Used to pay off debt, 2. Used to further education, 3. Put towards buying a house in future.

Two of my kids, 24F and 28M, have completely squandered this money in just a couple of years. My daughter spent it **all** travelling across the world care-free staying in nice hotels and eating fancy dinners. I completely understand going on a vacation, **but to blow all of it on travel against her mother's wishes?** Bloody shameful.

My son is even worse. He has literally spent it all on drugs, alcohol, and escorts over this time. None of it, **none**, going towards self-improvement as their mother wanted.

So I continued to hound them over this time and time again until, as expected, it's all bloody wasted. Once this happened, I decided to cut them both out of my will, as I don't want my hard-earned money being squandered so my children can live a hedonistic lifestyle for a couple of years.

I told this to their siblings in confidence, so that they would be prepared to deal with the fall-out when I eventually pass. One of them (not sure who) let it slip to them, and now they've gone off the deep-end and proclaimed I'm ""dead to them"" and they ""don't have a dad"" etc.

I don't want to go into a long bitter fued with my kids, but damned if I'm going to have my life savings wasted by them also.

Any advice on how to fix this?",relationship_advice

AITA for refusing to get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name even though I have one of my sons name?,"I have a tattoo of my sons name which I got when he turned 1. I've never had a tattoo after that. Met the love of my life 22 years ago, she had a 4 year old daughter, and I honestly truly love her like my own. 

Recently my wife's best friend noticed my tattoo (it's on my chest so usually covered up) and she asked my wife if I had a tattoo of my stepdaughters name. 

My wife said no, and her friend is convinced this is a huge sad imbalance and is unfair to my daughter etc. She told my wife this, and my wife agrees now and thinks that I should get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name to be fair. 

I don't want to do it at all, and I keep saying no, but my wife thinks a 'real dad' would get tattoos of both. I got a bit upset at that comment and told her I was a real bloody dad. I asked my daughter and she said 'I don't want a tattoo of my name, but if you are getting a tattoo for me I want you to get a cat' .... I love her very much but I'm not getting a freaking cat on me either. 

My wife is very sensitive about the fact that our daughter isn't biologically mine, I absolutely 0% care as my stepfather raised me and he is the best dad in the fucking world. I love my daughter and she loves me.

Am I the asshole for refusing to get this tattoo?

EDIT: a user pointed out I should explain why I got my tattoo. I got his name because he was premature and they told us he had a high probability of dying, the fact he didn't was a medical miracle. I was celebrating the first year of his birth because that was the biggest hurdle to get through. Never saw any need to get any tattoos after that.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by encouraging my husband in bed and ruining sex for the day NSFW,"So as usual, this wasn't today but last weekend.
After a busy workweek where me and my husband had been coming home, and pretty much passing out at the end of the day, we figured a Saturday afternoon would be the perfect time for some quality alone time.
I'd been teasing him for the morning whilst we did general household chores and finally dragged him upstairs mid afternoon to get down to business! 

Everything started off brilliantly, the clothes got thrown, things got hot and quickly led into some excellent 69ing.
Now, my husband is deft of finger and pretty quickly had me moaning with pleasure and a very intense orgasm. 
We quickly switched to him on top and i was encouraging him to go harder so that he could have a great finish as well. Still all good so far! I continued to egg him on, telling him to step up his game and FINISH HIM. (no body slam moves required)
....

After a particularly enthusiastic thrust I suddenly got a stab of pain in my side, making me curl up in agony. He mistook this for intense pleasure (apparently my pain face is similar to my sexy face? Not sure how to take that one!) and kept going for a couple more plunges before it finally became obvious to him as I burst into tears!

This lead into him panicking that he'd somehow broken me with his cock (he may be overestimating there) and me trying to figure out WTF had just happened and why I was crying. I'm guessing it something to do with the lovely stabbing cramps in my right hand side of my abdomen. Possibly.
Cue the naked running around as he grabs hot water bottle and glass of water while I curl up on the bed, now very lacking in sex appeal.

Turns out that if you have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), 'enthusiastic exercise' can sometimes cause a ovarian cyst to get over excited and burst! 

Worst part was, we were trying to fit in this fun time before his parents came over for dinner and now, 20 minutes before they arrive am now stuck in an ungainly position on the bed, totally starkers for all to see. 
I had to phone his mum to ask if she had any ibuprofen she could bring round for me as we had none in the house and then had to try and explain exactly why I needed them. Luckily she had the sense to not ask any further questions when i said it can be triggered by certain types of exercise.

Managed to get husband to help me pull some clothes on moments before they arrived, so saved some of my dignity at last.
He's now convinced his dick is cursed and is going to break me again.

"My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. [NSFW]","[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

Which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos *for me*. The day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn. 

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that **I'M** the one who wanted it? 

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit: 

- yes, I *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. Just *mostly* everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend **DOES HAVE A PASSCODE** on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is *definitely* not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

You guys are being a little mean about this.

**Edit** (again): 

Went to the police and will update when I can.

## MINOR UPDATE 

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, ""I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor.""

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it. 

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",relationship_advice

"Grandmother with dementia charged $13,000 USD for clothes at strip mall in Florida","My grandmother who is 91 with severe dementia was charged $13,000 for five pieces of clothes at a strip mall in West Palm Beach, Florida. We have limited the amount of money she can spend (she wrote checks for the clothes) and so the checks bounced. I have contacted the store owners who sent a 'receipt' for her purchases which is hand written on a piece of paper (no store business information) and just says 'dress $4000' and 'skirt $3000', etc.

Skinny wife happy life?,"Since my husband and I had our first child he doesn't want to do anything just the two of us even when our daughter is staying overnight at grandparents house.

About a year and half ago,  when arguing about him once again not wanting to have a date night alone.

Im 5'8 and was 140-150lbs before I had a  kid and I'm not going to lie I was struggling to lose weight and weighed 180lbs.  That remark cut me deeply. After that he quit wanting sex,  I had a hysterectomy and the thought of no longer being able to have more kids led to depression and  he began insulting me more telling me I was worthless, oink at me, and if he sees me changing clothes he will look at me with an appalled disgusted face and walk out of the room.  when I was awake I would repeatedly tell myself your disgusting, your worthless, my family is embarrassed to be seen with me over and over all day.

AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?,"I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn't want her boys to see it. 

Now it's not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I'm back she's started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I'm living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn't a random house I've moved back into. I've lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Dear \[Wife's name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I'm ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her ""I love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. I honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, I didn't care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words ""I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

She told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

I followed up by saying, ""But sometimes, people can see my butt.""

She started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

So I had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; I wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

I then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to [http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/](http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and I was shocked.

We were both curious where/how I even learned that from.

Was it a potty training error? Apparently not. We asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

the next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page.

"[NE & CO] My mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. Can she do that?","For some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. She has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since I've moved out for college. She demands access to absolutely everything I have. This will be important later.

&#x200B;

I'm 18 years old, and I'm a college freshman. I go to college in Colorado, but I was born and raised in Nebraska. In Nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. It was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. Like I said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when I do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200B;

My mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200B;

Recently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.

UPDATE Mother in law suing for grandparents rights,"OP POST BELOW

&#x200B;

So we have court 4/10 which is actually best case scenario as our house is now sold and we close early May. We passed this by our realtor whom we had supporting documentation of us moving back when we talked to her in May of 2018 stating we were going to move south. She is so awesome she wrote a letter stating we were moving prior to all this happening and got it notarized by the state.

This should be a slam dunk and the judge will likely ask why are you wasting my time? Her reason for the requested visitation is ""she loves her grand kids very much and deserves to be apart of their life"" per the law she has no leg to stand on and this is not a valid reason she would be able to get visitation even if she does we are moving and i don't believe NY state can stop that. One last thing about this is the petition she filled out my sons birthday isn't even correct its off by 4 days.

Fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick,"I'm SO sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/HAES movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. I'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but I'm well inside the 'normal' BMI range (BMI of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. I work out, I eat healthy, I have learned to control my urges and I take pride in taking care of my body. It irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  Because of this, I find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me I'm curvy or thick. FFS, you're fat! If you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. Rant over. 

EDIT: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why I care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. Fat is fat. Not curvy, just fat. There are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on YouTube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). I simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. Thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations. But hey, if calling me insecure/a bitch makes you feel better, go ahead :) ",unpopularopinion

TIFU by trying to buy an Instant Pot at Target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist,"This started yesterday but I didn't realize my FU until today.

Yesterday, I stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt Instant Pot at Target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. I decided I would get some Christmas shopping done early and flip a few. I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

Well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can't find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. I step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the State Police Counter Terrorism Unit and they start questioning me about why I'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if I know what they can be used for, if I'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the Target parking lot. I did my best to explain the price mistake and how I found it, etc. I think they accepted my explanation but I'm still nervous that I'm on a watchlist now.

TL:DR tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 Instant Pots at Target, got interrogated by State Police Counter Terrorism Unit why I was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

Edit: here's the investigator's card since so many people seem to be doubting my story. I covered up personal info so I don't dox him or myself.

MN: Someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.,"This past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard. They had been there for a bit when I let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously I wouldn't have done so). My dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). I coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck.

Last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. I can only imagine where he will be going with this.

I know I need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now I'm not even sure where to start. Am I liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard? Since our property is a notable size we have no tresspassing signs around but they're of course not visible from the air.

Edit: I should mention I Googled and the balloon bit that was ripped apparently costs tens of thousands. So that's why I'm concerned.",legaladvice
Allergic child in son's class (NJ),"My son is in full-day kindergarten, and the kids eat lunch and snack in their classroom (not the cafeteria), because there is a child with severe allergies to multiple foods. I first of all want to say that I am completely fine making accommodations so a child with multiple, severe allergies can go to school. I can't imagine what his family goes through, and how nerve-wracking this is for them. At the same time, all twenty kids in the class are now affected.


- kids are only allowed to bring in pre-packaged foods and beverages so that the teacher can check the ingredients, so I can't pack him a sandwich- everything has to be in a sealed package.


- Parents are asked not to serve the children any of the severe allergens for breakfast before coming to school, including peanut butter, eggs and dairy. 


- Parents with pets are asked to dress their children right before leaving the house, to reduce pet dander on clothes. The teacher suggested (but it's not required) that kids can get dressed in the garage :/


Again, I am happy to comply as best I can, but I am curious at what point accommodations go from reasonable to unreasonable. 



Edit: Just to clarify, because a lot of people have questions:

- Kids wash their hands at the classroom sink as soon as they get to school, and before and after lunch. 

- Kids *are* allowed to bring packaged food that contains allergens (other then peanuts), just no liquid milk, yogurt or hard boiled eggs, and no snacks that leave a heavy powder residue like Doritos. Kids can get food ""delivered"" from the cafeteria, as long as it's not the above mentioned food. 

- there are only two classes per grade, so switching classes is not a sustainable option. 


My kid is doing okay for now, thanks to his love of pita and hummus, which comes in a prepackaged snack cup. However if next week he decides he doesn't like hummus, or if he is being too messy with the hummus (the kid with allergies is allergic to sesame, which is in hummus apparently) we'll be in a jam- no pun intended, I think actual jam is okay.",legaladvice

"UPDATE: My neighbors caused themselves to be landlocked, I posted here, it's resolved now","I posted here for advice a while back and received some excellent, some funny and some conflicting advice from all of you.  The overwhelming advice was to get a lawyer, which I did. I explained the situation and that I had posted here, as well as the many topics you all prompted me to read up on (which was very helpful).  While my lawyer seemed pleased with your advice to me, he also urged me to immediately stop publicly posting about the situation, which I did (and which I see from my many messages has disappointed all of you!)

First thing's first: everything worked out in my favor.

My wife was upset by the entire situation and especially concerned with our children, and she got involved as well.  She spoke with some friends who were able to get her in touch with the local city council. They could not explicitly do anything direct to help us but did get us in touch with some of the right people to discuss our situation.

One of the most important results from those connections was learning that the ""sheriff"" who we spoke to was actually a deputy who was acting on the sheriff's behalf. We were able to meet with the actual sheriff.  He did agree that we should be more open to compromise but was much more willing to admit that we had no immediate legal reason to do so, and no interest in forcing us to.

My lawyer made a key point of the fact (I use the term loosely) that if the neighbors require an easement to access their land, they should so so with the land they sold, and not with unrelated land. After a lot of back and forth (but no court proceedings, luckily) with the other party, their attention was refocused on the buyer of their land. Funny enough, it's a small world and I ended up meeting the buyer who was in my lawyer's office for a consultation with one of his partner's. He ended up needing to get a different lawyer (since I already had a lawyer from the firm, as I understand it) but we did keep in contact to some extent.

Now, some speculation: we believe that the reason the neighbors didn't bother us for a while was their finances; their lawyer was happy to keep pushing as long as he was getting paid, but when money ran dry he lost interest. 

Due (we believe) to those financial problems as well as their inability to find a quick solution, the neighbors ultimately moved into town and lived with family there for several months. The neighbor on the other side gave them one-time access with a moving truck. Their lawyer had been showing up with them but was gone at that time, which is another reason I suspect major money issues.

In the fall the situation picked up again, with contact from a new lawyer this time. This new lawyer requested a meeting with us (and our lawyer, of course). He requested that we consider buying their property to resolve the issue. We initially said no, they offered it to the owner on the other side, they said no, they sweetened the pot. Eventually the price was right and my wife and I had developed an interest in more land. We discussed terms, then decided against it, they went a little cheaper again, we purchased their land.

I nearly posted an update once the purchase was complete but there was an additional interesting detail that came out of the woodwork, and brought new legal questions. The neighbors had used their land and home as collateral for an informal loan and the person who lent to them wanted the property when they failed to repay him. He came after us.  The outcome of this was that they are the ones who failed their end of the contract, so his problem was with the neighbors, NOT with us.  This is definitely a sideline from the original situation but caused a delay in my ability to update.

As of today, my wife and I are out a substantial amount of money due to legal fees, which it turned out was not worth going after from the neighbors. There is also bad news in that the home on that property was essentially worth even less than we thought, and there were major issues beyond the land itself (septic tank failure, leaking oil tank).  Those expenses were slightly mitigated by insurance but we are out a good some.

We also had a hard time combining the plots, which was legally desirable to build anything that straddled the two property lines. However the plots are now combined into one large plot.

The good is that the neighbors are no longer an issue for us, and by this summer their property should be in good shape to use for a new project of our own. On one hand, I will say this: the little chunk of land was definitely not worth the time and stress involved in this process, nor the money. However, the outcome was positive for our family (for which there is no dollar value) and it's all over with now.

My sincere thanks to everyone who offered advice.  There are far too many of you to thank individually, but please know that I appreciated everyone's contributions and I hope you're all still around to read my much delayed resolution.",legaladvice
"AITA for eating my all of wife's toblerone, then buying a new one?","Yesterday a mutual friend came over and gave her a gift of a Toblerone from his holiday in Switzerland. She agreed I could have some so I did. She's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so I ate the rest of an almost full packet.

She has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back. 

She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances.

Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland.

"TIFU by telling the grocery store they needed to get rid of their new, loud, automated door greeter.","This happened last week. I was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. I pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and I hear in an automated, LOUD, voice, ""THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT SAFEWAY!""  
Slightly startled by the unexpected greeting, I continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. Multiple times I hear, ""WELCOME TO SAFEWAY!"" And ""THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING YOUR LOCAL SAFEWAY."" And I think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.  
  
  After I pickup my script, I grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the U-Scan to check out and I am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. After I finish at U-Scan and turn to leave I see a manager speaking to the U-Scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, ""You guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. That THING is SOOOOOO annoying!""    
The manager looks at me like I'm A FUCKING MONSTER and says, ""There is NO WAY we are getting rid of Sarah! She isn't going ANYWHERE!""       
  
Confused and surprised I bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she's crazy and go to leave, running the confusion through my head, looking down as I walk. Then I go to exit and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and I look up. Turns out the robo-greeter Sarah is a human woman named Sarah with ALS or some kind of similar Hawking-esque catastrophic disability. She was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messages for customers as they enter and exit.   My stomach immediately SANK and my face turned red as I walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...

TL;DR I told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman.   
  
EDIT - Just to clarify, I think this is HYSTERICAL now. I find great hilarity at my own blunder, which is why I decided to share. I'm not going to a different store. I have no shame in going back there at all.

TIFU by changing a client's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu,"This just happened 2 hours ago.


I work for an IT company that services many small/medium businesses. I'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. We like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


I had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his PC unlocked. I sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. I quickly pulled up IE and googled ""sexy pikachu"". Found [the one](http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. Then I went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. Standard stuff.


I quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. He notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. Then he says, ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client's computer. You changed their background, not mine.""


I shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""Hey, I have Jane Doe on the phone. She says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" Jane Doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. I also believe she's the owner's daughter. At first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. He's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


I stand there for a good 30 seconds before I say ""Ok, send her over to me."" I'm a director and I have a working relationship with Jane Doe, so it's really best I talk to her.


I answer the phone. I listen to what she has to say. She had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. She attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new PC and she wants to know what's going on. I tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. I apologize for it, I tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. Thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. I hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  I've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""Hey, I'm locking my computer for you"" or ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""


TL;DR Tried to change coworker's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client's PC he was connected to instead. Main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. Am manager.",tifu
TIFU By trying to shake Obama's hand and almost getting taken out by Secret Service and ruining thousands of peoples day.,"As with most TIFU, this did not happen today but the memory was spurred by a post I saw on the front page. During the 2008 election, Obama came to my University to give a speech. I went through all the usual security screenings and made my way to my seat. I was about 3 rows from the front but on the outside seat of a row right against the entry and exit way for the future president. 

When Obama came out, he went straight to the podium to give his speech and do a QandA session. When he finished he made his way down the steps where the crowd rushed to shake his hand. I was probably 4^th or 5^th down the walkway to shake his hand. Everybody in front of me was not only shaking his hand but handing him copies of his book to sign. He had a pen in his hand and was signing away. I thought to myself ""Damn, I don't have anything for him to sign. hmmm OH WAIT! Yes I do. My ticket I used to get into the event."" There was only 1 issue with the ticket, it was in my jacket pocket...**my INSIDE jacket pocket**. So as the future president is 4 people away, I hastily reach my hand into my jacket pocket to grab my ticket but my hand kinda fumbled around a little before latching onto the ticket. Just long enough for the 2 secret service agents standing right in from of me to notice...

They immediately grabbed both my arms, while the one who grabbed my arm that was in the jacket twisted it to pull my hand out of the pocket while preparing to break my arm off if it was any kind of dangerous object. It all happened so fast I couldn't even utter a word, but when they saw all I had was a piece of paper for Obama to sign, he let go of my arm, patted me on the shoulder, and mumbled something into his headset. I was just able to get my bearings about me and I was the last person to shake Obama's hand at that event.  About that time the security all turned to Obama and shuffled him through an open door to the hallway to exit. As Obama was being ushered out he said ""Sorry guys, they said I have to leave now."" as he was pointing at the secret service around him. So not only did I almost get taken out by secret service, I ruined anybodies day that wanted a chance to meet the man.




TL;DR: Tried to shake Obama's hand and get an autograph, reached in my jacket and got assaulted by secret service and made Obama have to leave which ruined a bunch of peoples day.

"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...","If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

TIFU buying my son's Halloween candy away from him,"My kids go trick or treating. We live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

When they're young we tell them Santa brings every boy and girl a present on Halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

When the kids get old enough to realize Santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

Did this with our oldest two and it worked great. They'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

Our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the Santa thing. We explained the new deal. 

He said ""So then it's my money and I can buy *whatever* I want with it? A new skateboard even? *Anything*?"" ""You bet."" ""Swear?"" ""Yep."" 

He goes and brings us **all** his candy. Even every Kit Kat, his favorite. I was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

Getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 I'd spent all week. 

Next day I brought the candy to work. Then we went to Walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. We met at the check out. 

There's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred Kit Kats for $10.00. 

I started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""What? You said I could buy *whatever* I wanted! You swore! I want my candy back then."" 

His candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. And I did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

So... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

I don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this.

""After that, you have to go outside. Around back is where we keep Big Jim's dog. He's the baddest junkyard dog you've ever seen. You have to go get a tooth out of his mouth. And then, when you're done with that you have to go upstairs. There you'll find Big Jim's mom. She's 70 years old and never had an orgasm in her life. You've gotta go up there and fuck her to completion.""

The man says ""Wow, I can see why the jar is so full.""

After a few hours of drinking the man get sloppy drunk and says ""Fuck it,"" slaps down a $100 and jumps up on the bar and runs down and kicks Big Jim square in the jaw knocking him out cold. The bartender is stunned, as this is the furthest anyone has made it. The man runs outside to the cheers of the patrons and everyone hears snarling and growling and grows silent. Moments later they hear the dog whimper and then yelp, then nothing.

Moments later the man drunkenly stumbles back in and says ""Alright, now where's the old lady with the tooth?""",Jokes
Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"I literally do not know what to do. This is long, **TL;DR** at bottom.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  She's always been one of the most amazing people I've ever met. No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December.  Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July.  She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week.  I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck.  The doctors said this couldn't happen.  And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then.  But she left for work and now I feel completely torn.  What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do.  I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

**TL;DR:  Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July.  Wife got pregnant anyways.  It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.  Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it.  What do I tell her?**

**Edit:**  I should add I've been cheated on before.  Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**Edit** I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

**Edit** She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me.  I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

[UPDATE][Oregon] Neighbor cut down trees on my property,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/


Hello legal advice community! I have not forgotten about you, who helped set me on the path to justice! I'll get right to it. I can't speak to all the details, and I'm sorry about not continuing to update (after everything got underway I figured it would be best not to). To keep it short, we (my lawyer and I) spoke to the police, who then spoke to the neighbors down and across the street (the one who witnessed my trees getting cut down) who stated they saw the neighbor and the company cutting down the trees, and then finally they spoke to him (neighbor). I don't know much beyond that with the criminal investigation, what happened with the whole city document or the company, and why that is will be explained below.


I hauled his ass into court. Well, first, the arborist came, as did the surveyor. The trees were on my property and they were white oaks. The arborist gave me an estimate on having 15 mature white oaks brought and replanted on my property, which was just shy of $650,000, though he did say some trees would die and that would drive the cost up. I also had my property appraised, for the difference before and after losing my trees. It then became a question of whether I wanted to pursue my lost trees and see how much their lumber was worth, or sue for the replacement cost and loss of property value. Basically, do I want the trees back or do I want the cost of the ones I lost? (apparently you can't have both).

Well guys...

I PICKED THE TREES.

The actual court stuff started a lot sooner than I thought. We filed, a few weeks passed, and a few days before our day in court his lawyer reached out with a settlement offer. Apparently he was wealthier than I thought. We accepted and while I can't speak to the details of it...

I'M GETTING THE TREES BACK!

It's going to take a long time apparently (several months, possibly all the way until September since the process didn't start until just this week due to the Holidays), but I will have all 12 trees back on my property at no cost to me! My neighbor has also put his house up for sale, and I haven't seen him for quite some time now. Oh well! There's a bit more to the settlement, but I don't feel comfortable speaking to that, hopefully that's understandable.

I remember some of the comments about whether the trees were a hazard to the road based on how far they were from the road. I ended up having to check with the county (not the city), and they sent someone out to measure and mark the boundaries. My trees were at least 5 feet beyond it (so outside the boundary). Not even close! Just thought I'd add that in.


Anyways, there it is! I plan to take photos of the trees once they start getting put in, and of course once they are all in place and I have them back. I'll be sure to share them! I want to thank everyone for all their advice, it was a huge help! I didn't know you all were so into trees, but I'm glad you are!

Have a good one everyone!",legaladvice
TIFU by going for a walk and accidentally traumatising a woman for life,"Obligatory ""happened a few years ago etc"" but basically there was this walking/bike path near my house that I would occasionally walk along for exercise.

Sometimes, while walking, I'd set myself a personal goal, like ""reach that pole by the end of this song"" or whatever (I listened to music while I walked).

Well, one time I saw someone walking in front of me. They were a considerable distance ahead of me, but I decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time I reached my turnaround point.

So I started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. At the time I didn't think anything of it, because, hey, we're both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.

As I slowly yet surely got closer to her, I noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. I'd had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, I only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, I'd turn around and look behind me, because I thought she may have heard a bike bell that I hadn't heard over my music. Meanwhile I kept my speed up because I was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.

Near to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it's of course here that I finally catch up with her..

As I get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what I can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). Aimed directly at me.

I immediately realise what I've done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).
I gave her the most awkward smile in the world while I powerwalked past her, walked WAYY past my turnaround point so I could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.

As an added ""bonus"", I later learned that there was a notorious rapist named ""the bike path rapist"" that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.

TL;DR Decided to race a stranger without their knowledge, awkwardly followed them, caught up to them in the darkest section of the path, nearly got Bruce Lee'd, awkwardly smiled and powerwalked away.",tifu
Update: My sister (F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (F46) is pressuring me to,"Thanks for the great advice. So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

My grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

I explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.
My sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.

But what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

My mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket ""

Ya'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

My mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",relationship_advice
I think my brother's ex girlfriend has Munchausen by Proxy. Her toddler is becoming more ill. Help,"Thank-you all in advance... this is Hamilton, ON, Canada.

&#x200B;

Brief background: my brother began dating a teenaged girl with a toddler last year. I honestly would not have known she had a toddler except for her having mentioned it once. Over time, it became more and more clear that this girl is highly manipulative and untruthful. She somehow wormed her way into living with my brother and parents almost immediately, claimed to be going to college + have a part time job nearby. Having this girl as part of the family was very confusing: I literally would forget she was there because for hours at a time she would say LITERALLY NOTHING until she told some kind of crisis story, and they always seemed made up. Fight with my brother? Car crash. My mom annoyed that she was staying over every night? Sister came at her with a baseball bat. Brother finds out about shocking $50K in debt? Baby daddy extorted her and she has no legal recourse. Just all kinds of slightly unbelievable shit, but nothing major. This culminated with: Brother having misgivings about relationship? Ovarian cancer. At this point, I sat my family down and pointed out all the problems in her stories, and voiced my belief that she was neither in college nor had a job, and that she most definitely was making up the cancer (this I knew for sure based on the ridiculous treatment regimen she described). My brother confirmed all 3 of these things, (not before she claimed that they had mistaken a pregnancy for ovarian cancer) and broke it off.

&#x200B;

A sponsored post (SPONSORED POST. for more exposure, people) showed up on my page yesterday. It was a little girl in a full body cast. The little girl looked familiar, and holy shit, it's my brother's ex's daughter. I took the clickbait, and it lead me to the ex's page. Her whole profile is full of public posts about her daughter's MULTIPLE surgeries, rashes, and gastrointestinal issues. These are some of the most common issues that Munchausen's parents report in their children. I'm sure you know by now where I'm going with this. I'm absolutely terrified for that little girl. One of the posts describes ""third degree burns"" caused by ""fungi"" that the doctor found underneath her cast when the mother brought the girl into the emergency room YET AGAIN. The whole page is full of selfies with the little girl, and selfies in surgical scrubs. I know I have no evidence, but my gut is telling me that something horrible is happening. She's getting tons of attention for this.

&#x200B;

I called CAS, but they were rather testy with me on the phone (can't blame them, I have no proof of this), and said they will follow up with me ""if in the future we receive evidence worth investigating"". My question is, can I somehow alert the doctors that care for her at the local children's hospital? Could I get sued for alerting them? Is that defamation if I have no proof? I know where toddler gets treated because the mother is always geotagging.

your brother should deal with this

2) I am not telling my brother about this, it took soooo much energy for him to extricate himself from this situation with this girl

you're BIASED this POOR YOUNG WOMAN just trying to DO THE BEST FOR HER DAUGHTER why do you HATE PEOPLE FOR WANTING THE BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN

3) I have heard more bullshit come out of this woman's mouth than actual truth. Of course I am biased. She didn't give a single shit about her daughter until my parents kicked her out and all of a sudden her daughter is greviously ill??? With all kinds of common things that MBP women report to doctors?? I'm concerned!! I could absolutely be wrong! I would be delighted to be!

you think the doctors are STUPID they would KNOW

4) No they wouldn't necessarily though?? (C&P from another comment) Let me give you an example. A child can get an infected cast in a myriad of ways (kids put their hands in all kinds of things!), but a mother could also put something gross in the cast to infect (under the guise of cleaning, whatever). This would result in an infection that is diagnosed the same whether the child gets it naturally or the mother does it on purpose.",legaladvice

TIFU by ruining a movie shoot with Jennifer Aniston,"Disclaimer: This should be, ""several years ago IFU,"" but I'm a reddit n00b and wanted to share one of the most awkward series of events I've ever caused.

I had plans to meet up with some friends in Atlantic City for the weekend. I got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the Taj Mahal. I had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.

I parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. On my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. He let a bunch of people in and, of course, I squeezed through as he was closing it off.

That is where things went sideways. I saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, ""huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if I'll be in it?"" But before I could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. A second later, someone yells, ""ACTION!""

I start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, ""I'm not suposed to be here, am I?"" He immediately shook his head no.

So, I see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. I think to myself, ""if I can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby."" 

I make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. SUCCESS! I didn't screw anything up!

After a few more steps, I catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. And they're blocking the full width, and NOT WALKING! I mean, come on!

Only at this point, do I see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. Then someone yells ""CUT!"", and the two people in front of me turn around. 

Turns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were Jennnifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, and I completely blew up their scene. There was nothing I could do.. I just said, ""Uh, I'm sorry."" I figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. Butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.

TL;DR. I somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation.",tifu
"TIFU by texting my pregnant wife that ""this isn't working""","My wife posted earlier today on LA about this. Not using my main because my FIL knows it and I'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

I went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. I had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when I turned it on. Most of them were asking how I could do this. I had no clue what she was talking about. She didn't answer any of my calls back.

I got home and she was packing up to leave. I'll admit it, I cried. A lot. Had no clue what was happening or what I did. Finally, it comes out that I texted her that I wanted a divorce. She showed me the text and I immediately realize what happened.

This morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. I texted her ""the new mirror came in! I'm going to try to put it together but I may need your help later"". I had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. I texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point I think I need to just give up"". Apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. So my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while I was off thinking everything was great. She even called a divorce lawyer.

Things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. She told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

TL;DR Accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. To address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-I usually work from home unless I need to meet with clients. I don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. That's why she didn't know I was at work yesterday. I'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. If my phone goes off, I could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-My wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. That's why she had the reaction she did.

\-My comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. Neither of us is mad at the other. This was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. We're fine. I posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. No need to psychoanalyze my wife or PM me about divorce. We are fine.

\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. We weren't really in a ""home improvement"" mood last night.",tifu

AITA For Refusing To Support My Wife Through Her Diagnosis After Her Infidelity,"My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

She recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

We talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

Before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.

They (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?

**Edit**: To the reddit detectives further down. When I said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. We talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. Secondly, I mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when I was told I didn't believe it, I figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment I left. I also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. As far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. And I figured this would be easy to figure out but I guess not, I knew her friend forced her to tell me because I demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. Finally, I know a lot of people post made up stories. I'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details I can't prove it. If I wanted karma I wouldn't be on a throwaway, I posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable I think it's time for neutral third party judgement and I was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided.

[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/)

So I took the advice of the previous thread, which was overwhelmingly to consider setting up a trust for my two problem children.

Before I even invited the two of them over to talk the issue over, my son called me to apologise for how he was acting. He seemed genuinely ashamed of the things he said and admitted that it was wrong of him to waste his mother's savings like that.

Anyway, I invited the two of them over to tell them my plans. As I say, my son seemed very apologetic, while my daughter was clearly still upset with me.

I told them that I would reinstate their inheritance, but since they've demonstrated extremely poor money management that I will only do so through a trust. That I'd talk with a proper lawyer/financial expert on setting them up, and they'd be designed to provide for them and any future children they have over many years after I'm gone. That them blowing through it in a few years is simply not an option.

Son took the news very well and said he wouldn't trust himself with that money anyway. I'm not sure what caused such a sudden change of heart in my son, but as I say it **seemed** genuine. He also offered to go to therapy for his sex/drug addiction if I helped pay, to which I agreed (I'll make sure this therapist actually exists, don't worry). 

My daughter did not take it well, Christ. Far worse than I expected. Here I am willing to give them a second chance, and she just blows up about how it's not fair that it's only them that don't get the money outright. I explained that their siblings had demonstrated they were responsible with money and hence why I would leave it to them outright. Nope, not good enough for her. She doubled down that spending all of her mother's 300K+ GBP on travel was justified. Had the gall to again call me several extremely upsetting names and accuse me of being emotionally abusive.

A male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. He just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.,"Spa is in Maryland. A friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. He is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. He has not spoken with management yet. He just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. Any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

Edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

Minor update: I advised him of his many options after reading the comments. He went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. Mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

I'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. The mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

Thank you everyone for the comments. If this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. ",legaladvice
"My sister(F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even if my mom(46F) is pressuring me to, for families sake.","I made a post yesterday but forgot my password so I made a new alt.

Okay so I am a huge Marvel nerd. The kind of nerd that Cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. Mostly fanservice.

My sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". She claims I am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

Besides that we have a good relationship. We are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

So 3 years ago I managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the USA and meet the real Stan Lee! He signed one of my own pictures I did of the big 3 and complimented it. It's was one of the best days of my life.
Since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

Flash forward. A few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and I tell her no. Reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. She pouted and I left the house.

When I come back is see my fucking Stan Lee autograph ripped up on the flor! I fucking lost it. Then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). When she saw that I was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that I can get a new one.

I pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. She tries to engage in conversation but I shoot her down. She tries to bribe me with movie tickets and I tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. She hasn't apologized for it. She just says that I should be over it by now.

My mom says the same. She says a materialistic things shouldn't come In between family and that I should simply let it go. My dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. He is as big on Marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. This whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

My mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and I think they both disrespected me. Mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

I feel awfully guilty but also raging mad. Can somone help me with this?

Edit :thanks guys for listening to me. I feel a lot better. I will take what many of you said and I am going to send them examples of how much Stan Lee's autograph costs. But I think I have to word it very good so that they don't think that I would ""split up the family over money""

Update : Thanks for the support. My dad and I found somone that restored pictures and we are taking my piece to it. Dad is going to use part of the money he was going to gift my sister for her car down-payment.

This happened in NY.

I'd like to thank everyone who replied to that post. It was very helpful.

After the post my SO and I decided to get a hotel. When we came back this morning the power was back on. My neighbor told me what happened:

Shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). The firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. Long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

The poor kid's parents have already begun complaints to the relevant authorities. I'll be meeting a lawyer tomorrow about breaking my lease.",legaladvice

TIFU by matching with my homophobic uncle on Grindr,"So I have an uncle (we will call him J) who has always been VERY vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. There is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

Well this weekend in between family gatherings I was looking to meet somebody . I started chatting with an older man because that's how I roll. A lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so I don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. We actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics I wish I could unsee and sending a few I wish I could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

So I'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . It is at this moment I realize my FU, I've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  He tried to play it off like a random encounter but I wasn't letting him get away with that. After some pressing he finally admits that he is the man I've been talking to and I told him I don't judge him like he does me . He apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

He kept talking with me like he was still INTERESTED and I had to make it clear that was NOT going to happen . I had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him I had to go ahead and block his number. I can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

Always get a face pic, people.

TL:DR: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . Should have insisted on the face pic

Edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but I'll answer some pressing questions . I did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who I was . It is pretty disturbing to say the least. As far as blackmail goes I have everything saved but I don't plan on doing anything with it as I think that could actually put me in danger . This man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

"Wife told me she wanted to experiment, I obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.","Throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. My (28m) wife (26f) and I have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. We had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. However, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". She has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. My wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". At first I thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. I had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days I obliged.

That next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. Additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. We were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. However, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. I was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but I agreed.

This is when things took an extreme turn. During this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. I had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""I want your shit"". I pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""I want you to shit on me"". I pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. I felt like a fucking dick because she thought I was kinkshaming her. In a way, I was because I thought the request was far too extreme. I ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

After that incident, my wife and I hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. At the end of the week, I asked my wife to talk about what happened. She told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. I thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. I couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

We fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, I tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. I told her that I will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. She was so happy and even though I was still completely nauseated by this desire, I wanted to satisfy her.

That brings us to tonight. We were having sex for the first time this week when I (regrettably) confessed to her that I had to take a shit. She perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. I still really didn't want to go through with it, but since I had promised her I pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

She got into the bathtub and I hung my ass over the side of the tub. I started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. I turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. With enough time, I was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. I could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. However, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, I felt a sensation around my asshole.

I turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. I was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. Seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

As I clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and I heard it land somewhere beneath me. I was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so I ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. As I was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how I will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, I heard footsteps approaching. My wife lightly knocked on the door. I didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more I thought about what just happened. She walked away and then I got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

I've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. We have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but I don't think I can look at her after what she did to me. I feel deceived and violated by the woman I love and trust. During our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. She knew how uncomfortable I was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

I would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. I'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, I cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and I. I know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

"AITA for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.","throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so I'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when I graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. I remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill I found out the terms and conditions, I can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses I can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so I told my parents that I cant accept the gift as I dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,I also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where I was called ungrateful and that I'm not a nice daughter. so I walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off.

"TIFU by applying for jobs for the past month as ""Titty Boobowitz""","I've been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and I recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. I should also mention that for almost ten years I've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. It's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. Or so I thought. I had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when I received this email from one that I was particularly excited about:

***I have to say when ""Titty Boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox I got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  Your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***I look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

Ooops. My stomach fell right out of my ass when I read that. And of course the most recent thing I had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. I tried to do damage control, but I did not have high expectations. Today I finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

TL;DR: Somewhere along the line while I was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to Titty Boobowitz in gmail and I never noticed. Then I attempted job hunting. No wonder I got no responses.

EDIT: Just because I didn't make it clear - I emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and I appreciated the heads up. We had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. I'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to TONS of idiots like me.

TIFU by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them.,"My grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. They don't go out much from their house. So I help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to ATMs etc.  I'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

Few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. It usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. I also had somethings to attend to. So, when I was done, I realised that it was late. I came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that I'll return his pension the next day. 

The next few days were so hectic that I completely forgot about his pension. I usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which I keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. I use the latter one more. After 5 days, I was in need of some cash. So I opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

I was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. I was so ashamed that i ran to their house. I knew that they'd be angry so I bought some groceries as a compensation. As soon as My granddad opened the door,  I started apologizing. He kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as I was done. I handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

Well my guilt was gone and I was again my normal miserable self. I opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. My guilt came running back to me, I walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. I knew I was the cause of this. 

I asked them about it and they told me how they knew I was busy and thought that I'd turn up when I have the time. They didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. I had never been more ashamed in my life.  My one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

They already had a really hard life. They had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. First their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. And I guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. It's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. I guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

TL;DR: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. They didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

My grandma is not literate. She dropped out of school in early years and couldn't read or write much. So she can't access any services. She just does the household chores. 
That's why I've been helping them.

If Women have the right to abort a child then people should have the right to Voluntarily Euthanasia,"For example ""My Body, My Choice"", Women (In the United States) have the right to abort a fetus if they decide if they don't want a child for either financial reasons or any other reasons they do not want to be mother for any other reason.

People that are going through Depression should have the right to Voluntarily Euthanasia because they don't want to be alive anymore. The reason I am discussing this method of death is because imagine your suicidal struggling with mental illness and your only choices are the most gruesome methods of death such as a gun, (Which Gun laws are getting even stricter) and a Rope, or other methods like allowing yourself to get hit by a car or train.
Obviously if your struggling you don't what your family to come home to see your lifeless corpse hanging from the ceiling or your brains just simply splattered like paint all over the bedroom walls and ceiling. Using someone else to kill you like a Truck or train imho is just selfish and not morally right, imagine leaving a burden on them because they technically are the cause of your death and are charged with involuntary manslaughter.

Another reason people should be entitled to Euthanasia because the Mental Healthcare system in the US is a joke. Take it from me, a person that's been having expensive therapy sessions for over 4 years with many different therapists and I admit I have tried Suicide once which is what gotten me Therapy in the first place. The Second time I felt Suicidal tendencies I called an Anonymous hotline just to talk about feeling worthless and a few minutes later I had a bunch of squad cars at my door.

How come people on Death Row get Euthanasia after the government spends more money housing and caring for inmates than the people in mental hospitals that's been suffering for years and wish for the sweet release of death?

My Grandmothers brother had suffered from dementia in the last 2 years of his life in hospice, on some days he would smile upon seeing his sisters face and on the other days he would speak gibberish and start ranting. I'm sure he didn't understand the concept of what was going on his mind but I'm sure he begged for the mental and emotional pain to go away.

I (29M) just spent another awkward holiday with my girlfriend's (28F) rich family,"My girlfriend and I have been together almost 3 years. 99% of the time, we're great. She's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. But every time we visit her family I start doubting everything. 

They are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. I come from a very middle class background. I have a good education and a decent career that I really enjoy, but I'm definitely not rich. Because of this, they view me as a loser.

For example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish Honda. When we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. She was furious we didn't bring GF's Land Rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. GF doesn't like to drive on long trips and I'm not allowed to drive the Land Rover (per her parents) so we brought my Honda. 

GF's dad has never spoken to me directly. Even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""What does he do?"" So we went in the house and I gave her dad the usual, ""Hi, merry Christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

One more example: Last year I made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. It was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and I even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. GF's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to GF they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

We managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which I'd normally consider a win. But today I keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if I'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. GF and I have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but I know they'll never accept me. If we get married I'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. GF has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but I can tell it bothers her too. They bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and I think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

So, not to sounds like an asshole, but am I wasting my time? Is this relationship doomed? GF always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but I'm not sure that's true. She always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. But I know I'll never be good enough for them, even if I'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: My girlfriend's rich parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",relationship_advice

And they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

After this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

That night I had picked him up, I changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. This is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or ""washes his hands"" with the baby wipes. This time he was not himself. He was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. As I took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, ""No! No no [Friends boyfriends name]!"" And began crying hysterically. 

My heart sank. As a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. I know something was done to my baby. 

I looked my friends boyfriend's criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. This man is dangerous, and I didn't even know this.

**My Concerns And What Can I do?:**

Notably in Wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does CPS investigate the person reporting? Both myself and the party involve?

Will the investigators / CPS take this matter seriously when regarding my child's age?

How do I go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

What kind of things will they (either CPS or law enforcement etc) look into?

If reported, and nothing happens, what things can I do to protect my child(ren) And my family? 

For a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs I can keep my eyes open for?

Any advice, any help at all will greatly help. I'm absolutely devastated and need help as I'm at a loss.

**Edit:** I need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why I'm scared for myself and my family.

**Edit 2**: I am currently on my way to my appointment with CPS and Law Enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases I will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, I honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome.",legaladvice

Judging people by their looks works well for the vast majority of cases.,"So here's the thing: Looks are not something that just randomly fell into place or whatever, but they are to a large part the result of choices and efforts made. For example, if you are well kept and wear a professional outfit, you're probably someone that cares a lot about impressions and your career, and most likely you have a fairly conservative outlook on life. Equally, if you look like a stoner or like you don't care about your looks, then that also says something about your values and beliefs. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's just obvious. If you are a woman, cut your hair short, and dye it three different colors, it's also not too hard to guess your political leanings. Same for someone running around in polo shirts and boat shoes only.

In the vast majority of cases, going by the initial impression leads to fairly good results. No, looks don't mean everything, and yes, I am aware of the halo effect, but really this ""Don't judge a book by its cover!"" nonsense needs to stop.",unpopularopinion

"AITA for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (About $700)","I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but I'm not a casino and while I'm not destitute, I can't afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because I've been banned.

Edit2: wow since I'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I'm really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

Edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I've lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN'T be this dramatic in real life...I'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I'm still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that's cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You'd say yes. Now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I'm taking the whole thing."" You would say no. It's how I've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I've given people quarters to play, I've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I've taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.

Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.

> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say ""your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?""  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.


Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators.

WIBTA if I didn't give up MY honey moon villa to my grandparents?,"My family is Asian, my husbands side is white.

My husband and I got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our ""real"" one. 
We were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. My husband and I took the villa.

The bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. We made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

Our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

We have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. During dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. My grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

Well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to ""slave"" and live as ""peasants"" while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

This is bora bora we're talking about. No one is living as a peasant here. 

There was only 1 villa available in our section. Had I given it to my grandparents I think it would've been offensive to my husbands grandparents. If there was 3, we would've given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. But unfortunately, there wasn't. I mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

I obviously objected, and said I felt as though my husband and I should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate OUR marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? Wouldn't one just sit back and be grateful they're on a free vacation instead of complaining?

My grandparents freaked out. Saying I'm holding money above their head and that I'm being disrespectful and not following their orders. They stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

Idk what to do. My side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and I agree. They are so ridiculous. All I wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it's falling apart. 

I don't think I'm the asshole at all, but I've been up all night thinking wether I should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. But another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

So Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA if I denied giving up my villa?



***UPDATE***
Even though I really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, I decided it'd be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that I was disrespectful.

During breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if I was there. Everyone tried calling them-nope we're not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. After a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

I made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. They said they hadn't looked yet and that should be my job if I was kicking them out?? I made sure they knew I was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

They kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. Every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

Well, I'm not doing that. 
I'll pay for their flight back home, but I've already done enough accommodating on MY honeymoon vacation. 

So there you have it. My grandparents weren't even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. I called their bluff. 

After breakfast, I found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. They also didn't get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

Staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. Im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. My cousins came over and honestly couldn't care less my grandparents are gone, in their words ""they kill the vibe"". So everyone's happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

I'm happy I was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

I have an overflow of messages and comments, that I can't get back to. However, the main question is what my profession is.

TIFU by thinking I had a family history of glaucoma after finding my dad's weed 17 years ago,"tldr at the bottom

17 years ago I passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. Being a huge nerd I checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when I found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. I just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. I handed it to him, said I didn't care who it belonged to but if I ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. He just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, ""it's your mom's for her glaucoma"". Whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.

&#x200B;

I was at a family a dinner awhile ago and I can't remember what someone said but I replied with, ""yeah, because mom has glaucoma"" and my mom goes, ""I don't have glaucoma"" and I, incredulously, said ""dad said you had glaucoma"", in which my dad responds to with, ""what the hell are you talking about, I never said that"". After reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe I believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. I told them I had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit I'd been on for the past like 15 years. They just laughed harder.

"Me (M34) and fiancee (F27), I am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship.","Alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as I'm doing it. As it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. I'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (I only found  out because one of her friend's BF contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). I confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. I'll be totally honest in saying that I'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. I manned up, moved on and proposed (which I had planned on doing anyway). This is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to recent time. We are due married in November (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. Distant, not herself, away with the fairies. Even stopped having sex, which was very strange. I put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. Forward to Christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. I confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. I was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200B;

However, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. I arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. The vibe was bad guys, I could tell. We sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. At this rate I was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. Basically, a few of her friends had back in October (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. I'll be honest, the idea made me ill. I said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. Pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........I got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. I wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. We got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. I basically said that I needed some headspace, and that I'd spend the weekend at my mates. It was quick after that, and I left without a fuss. I'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. I am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. I suppose if anyone has been in a similar place I could do with some advice

I couldn't even put my tray down.  Leaning my seat back doesn't really help.

Can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?,"Yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and I chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. A Plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

The girl tried to say I was trying to steal her phone. I told the officer that I could unlock the phone and the girl could not, I told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

He refused to give me the chance or believe me. He told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

I left. 

The girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so I decided to check back 2 hours later. I saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

When no one was in her store and her back was turned I took my phone back. 

Before anyone starts going off on me for it, I know. I know exactly what I did was extremely stupid but I am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

I am asking for the legalities of it.

The phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

The place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that I am on video. My questions are simply did I break any laws?

If the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and I was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did I break the law?

EDIT: Thanks for all of the info. I do not wish to pursue a police complaint nor do I wish to report the crime. I am too lazy for that.

AITA for telling off a nude woman that my kid saw on the way home from school?,"I was walking my kid home from school. We are in a pretty nice area so the windows tend to be huge and on ground level. 

My child is 6. Suddenly she laughed and pointed at one of the houses. Inside there was a completely naked woman leaning down to pick something up right in front of the window. We could see everything clear as day. 

I know the woman, she is one of my wives friends. I laughed along with my kid as she clearly wasn't bothered but inside I was a little WTF. 

I saw her at a coffee and cake morning  at school a few weeks later and she and my wife and I happened to sit on the same table. I tried to be as tactful as possible towards the end and say hey, Sophia and I kinda saw you naked a couple weeks back, maybe since you're near the school it'll be less awkward to just draw a curtain? 

She was very offended and told me I was being inappropriate and I was floored. I was even more floored when my wife agreed with her. I told my wife later that if it was a naked dude all hell would have already broken loose. She wants me to apologise to her friend.

TIFU by accidentally asking my wife's sister for a three way.,"This fuck up mainly involves three people me [M32], my wife [F27] and her sister [F25].

So for context a normal Saturday is for my wife and I to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

This week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

So off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

Now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our Saturdays.

As we are about to leave her sister says ""Have fun"" in a cheeky way which I completely don't pick up on.

My brain decides that as my wife and I spent Thursday together for Valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

So straight after the ""Have fun"" and without consulting my wife, I say ""You can tag along if you like""

The atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and I'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so I double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""As you said it will be fun"".

My wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when I've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

Still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

I've apologised and explained. I know we will laugh about it later but for now I'm playing LEGO lotr on my own. 

TL:DR I asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do.

Edit: Well this post went nuclear! Oh and thanks for the golds kind strangers. 

A couple of things i'd like to address, many of you seem to think its bad we don't spend Saturday with our kids. Well I work from home 4 days a week and my wife is a stay at home mom. Our kids are not yet school age so it's nice for us to have time as a couple on a Saturday.

Work Punishments Include Drinking Soap and Other Abuse,"My girlfriend works at a retail store in California. They are supposed to ask customers if they want to buy a particular item and there is a punishment board for not doing so. The employee is allowed to choose their punishment from a punishment board.

The punishments are either very hard and often demeaning work or obviously illegal punishments. The hard work is things like cleaning toilets or moving heavy objects. Other punishments include doing pushups, coworkers being allowed to hit you with a stick, drinking soap, eating dog food, and sucking on undesirable objects that are not meant for human consumption.

Is this illegal? They could argue these obviously illegal punishments are not mandatory, but there is an incentive to do them because the other punishments are so difficult.",legaladvice

Earlier today I posted about if should tell my girlfriend I have autism, originally she never wanted to date someone with autism because her brother had low-functioning autism and it drove her mad, even though she loved him. She has never experienced a high-functioning person with autism until she met me, but when we started dating I was too scared to tell her and even more scared when she said she did not want to date someone on the spectrum. When she got home we had a convo and I told her I was on the spectrum, and she started to cry apologizing for what she said a few weeks back. I told her it was okay, and we hugged. She was happy I told her because then she was able to understand some traits I do and have a different look about autism. Thank you guys for helping me find the courage to tell her! Now I'm sure our relationship will grow stronger! Keep changing peoples lives and making others happy! 

Just wanna add one more thing, my girlfriend had a reason to say what she said. Living with someone with autism depending on the level is very stressful. He is low-functioning, so Imagine having a child/sibling who cry's, breaks things, and you have to keep an eye out for them when in public AT ALL TIMES! she was unaware of the different levels of autism and said she will learn more about it for me and her brother, this is why I love her :)

Update sister took $250K from mother with dementia,"original post is nearly a year old.

Mother passed away, and within a week older sister & caretaker of mom for 2 years had gotten our mother with dementia to sign over $250K, bought a house, put it in her name, and had about $20K left over that she kept, and hid it from me for a year.  She realized I had a good idea of the value of our mother's estate and admitted it to me.

I tried to work with her, and get her to pay out the other siblings what their fair share of the $250K would have been to them/us, she refused and cut off communication.

"AITA for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?","Using a throwaway. Some context; I live in CA, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She's 22, I've known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She's very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

But then my wife goes, ""And she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

I'm 41, my wife is 42. I was like ""You're kidding, right?""

She wasn't kidding. At first, I was like ""Hell no."" But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I'm going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.

1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. What's the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

I know, I'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

So, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I'm cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. 

After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is ""None of my business."" I got a little pissed at that. 

I told him he's staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I'm not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him ""uncomfortable"". I replied that I'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

Well, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it's none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.

So Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?

EDIT: some info:

I asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

I would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

When I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.

I would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.

Edit 2: Some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

FINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn't have a problem.

Now, I always look to see how full the cup is after removal. It's a weird thing to do, but I think it's kinda cool to see how much is in there. 

Apparently, unbeknownst to me, my bathroom spider bro was also interested in my red water tidings. As I was removing the cup, he dropped down to check out the situation. Not expecting a spider to the face that early in the morning, I jerked back, shrieked, and fell off the toilet.

So it has been a while since my previous update, and I wish I could tell you all that it's because we were involved in a super exciting court battle (""No, YOU'RE out of order!"") but the truth is much more annoying and banal, as life tends to be. 

As we left it in the last post a couple months ago, our lawyer called the law firm who submitted the action against our property and said ""You have no grounds for this, take it off."" The paralegal he spoke to said the lawyer handling the case was out that day but would contact our lawyer soon.

They did not. For WEEKS. Despite everyone bugging them, they were very disinterested in resolving the issue. Color me shocked.

In the meantime, we're getting junk mail from law firms and mortgage management companies at least every 2-3 days, saying they can help us with this issue we don't have. The notices start to be addressed to us personally instead of the this other random guy who said he owned our house. This displeases us. I start keeping a little pile of these letters next to the stairs with copies of our mortgage payments notices from the bank, just in case.

This goes on for a while, long enough for my initial (!!!!!!!) anxiety to fade into more of an ""Eh."" situation. Until yesterday. 

Our lawyer finally got a response to his email from July, where he outlines everything and attached a preponderance of evidence showing we continue to own our house, and their response is, and I quote : ""We will remove the action."" Period. No Good Afternoon, no Sincerely. We will remove the action. A shart of an email after weeks of worry.

So with a whimper, we got what we wanted. Obviously we will continue to monitor everything until they actually do what they said they will, but it is a load off my mind. I wish I had something more exciting to tell you, but it seems in the legal world, exciting = bad.

Thank you all for your concern, your advice, and your upvotes. I hope that if any of you face a similar situation, that reading this can help you figure out how to resolve it.

I've had lab mates who went to Oxford and Harvard who I wouldn't have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. You know they're awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

I had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. For example one example of a former close I had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. After, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. His ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. He did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. He always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others. People initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills, but over time they see the truth that he's just a total loser. In the neighborhood I grew up with there were a lot of people like the one guy I described above.

TIFU by being on this subreddit too much and hurting my boyfriend's feelings,"Anyone remember the TIFU of the guy that suck his own dick in front of his assistant at a Bachelorette party? He included a drawing of how he did that.

So my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.

I commented about it and said ""Hey that's how the TIFU guy sucked his own dick."" 

My boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and I gave him a little push.
Obviously he isn't as flexible (just like how most people are not) and I said;

""Well it's okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick""

And in that moment I felt as if time slowed down and I can see his face going into this super disappointed look.

And that is how I fucked up by hurting his feelings.


TL;DR: I told my boyfriend he have a small dick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings

Edit: Y'ALL NEED TO CHILL. I never did mention that his dick is actually small (and to clarify, hell no it isn't).
To give more context, it all happened in a light hearted and silly mood. Sure his feelings probably got hurt for a while (can't deny that horrified look I saw) but obviously I reassured him and we laughed about it. 

Reason I posted this is because my boyfriend is the one that casually mentioned about posting here, and I am curious what kind of reaction it'll get

We are now both laughing at how worked up some of you actually got ;)

I [26F] saw my husband [27M] in a gay porn and I don't know how to confront him about it,"Last night, I was watching porn while my husband was asleep. I've always liked gay porn, I watch gay porn exclusively. I go to pornhub and start browsing. I'll try to not make this as graphic as it could be, but I clicked on a random video and it was definitely my husband. His face was fully visible, several unique tattoos. It was him. I knew  without a shadow of a doubt this took place after we were married because he had the goddamn ring on!

I was furious and disgusted. He had unprotected sex with multiple men. All I could think of was STDs. I didn't sleep last night. I called off from work, too. First thing I went to a free clinic to get checked. I haven't been home since. I don't think I can fucking look at him. I'm so fucking angry. 

What do I do?

TLDR Saw husband with multiple men in gay porn that definitely took place after we were in a committed relationship. Would it be gauche to ghost my husband at this point?

UPDATE: I spoke to him. He said he has a meth problem and that it ""turns him gay"". This has been going on for months. He meets randoms off Grinder. This was not an isolated event. I'm devestated. He said he'd go to rehab. I told him we're wayyy past all of that and that I wanted a divorce. He said he'd do whatever as long as I didn't tell anyone because fuck our marriage, fuck the life we have, who cares about that! It's all about his image. I'm just collateral! Yo, I don't give a fuck, I'll send screengrabs to his boss, to his mom, to every one. Fuck you, Brandon.

Update - WIBTA if I still give my stepson the birthday gift I bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift will upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first?,"Hi Reddit, just dropping by to give you an update to my post. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta\_if\_i\_still\_give\_my\_stepson\_the\_birthday/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta_if_i_still_give_my_stepson_the_birthday/) 

Jack celebrated his birthday in September, and as many of you suggested, I told him that I'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. That way it didn't look like Kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy Kim's gift. 

Kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that I was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. It's flattering to read that so many of you think that Joe and I are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with Kim. It was humbling for Kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. Hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

For those who are asking, I didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because I wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone I know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. But since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, I bought Jack a horse. My family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

Jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

TIFU by letting my boyfriend have a lie in.,"Obligatory just over a week ago comment. So I have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we've only been together three months. And also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

Ragebeak belongs to me. It is a Saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. Still, I thought being a Saturday I'd take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

I fell down the stairs. Still holding very small parrot and my first thought was OH GOD DONT CRUSH HIM so I threw my hands up like I just didn't care and...

I broke my back.

And then when I finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) I passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

Woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like THE DEAD and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

TL;DR removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. Right in his face.

EDIT - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so I'm not paralyzed and there shouldn't be any life-ruining effects. I'm just on bed rest and LOTS of pain medication!

Thanks for the silver! And gold! AND THE POO! And all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)

People obsessed with sports are just as nerdy as people into video games or dungeons and dragons.,"Title says it pretty well. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge sports fan, I like teams in the NCAA, NFL, and MLB. I follow them all very closely. I am a nerd because of that. I sit alone and watch games and yell and carry on, but so many people are in denial about this.

There are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing. That should garner just as much criticism as majoring in psychology, gender studies, and sociology. Those degrees are completely useless if you don't get a job like selling tickets for your local college team.

We all know someone who is that ""sports are my life guy"" 

Also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or D&D are these sports nerds. There's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

Again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. Sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it. 

Edit: getting a lot of replies because I included psychology, I have a psych degree myself just saying if you don't go to grad school it doesn't help much finding jobs.

Edit 2: lots of furry hate on here, which it's funny how random that is. But the point I'm trying to make is live and let live.  

Edit 3: hey, hey, hey, this is NOT an opportunity to rip on people who like sports either, the main point I'm trying to make is live and let live. If you're tearing into ""sports jocks"" for being unintelligent on here then you're just as bad as the guys who this post was initially targeting.

TIFU by hating the person in front of me at the drive-thru,"This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, mainly due to lack of sleep. I decided to go to Starbucks for some caffeine to help offset the long day ahead of me, as you do. At a traffic light really close to the drive-thru, I was right behind a large SUV sitting in the rightmost lane. I wanted to turn right, and they did not—I couldn't turn, but no biggie. After a long wait, light turns green, and they decide to turn right spontaneously. I was annoyed, but whatever. (No signs say you can't turn right on red.)

They turn into the Starbucks drive-thru, blocking me from going and making it so that I'd have to partially block the small road leading into the strip mall or circle around. I had to be somewhere soon, so I took my chances. They didn't pull in all the way, so I stuck out in the small street, annoyed. Luckily no one came behind me.

I guess I was in an extra bitchy mood today, but I just started hating this lady and her stupid massive SUV and the little chihuahua hanging out her car window and the stupid TV's playing cartoons in the car and the 6 frappucinos they had to hand her. I thought, ""I bet she's one of those super shallow people who lives for the rat race."" I pulled up to the window to get my drink, wanting this clearly shallow-ass lady to leave already.

Once I pulled up, they smiled, handed me my drink and said, ""The person in front of you paid for your order already.""

I had never felt so forcefully slapped by the universe before. I could practically hear the words ""shut the fuck up"" ringing in my dumb little brain. Immediately my day got 100 times better and easier.

Faith in humanity restored, and I hope whoever I was so horrifically judging had a wonderful rest of their day.

TL;DR I spent 10 minutes hating and judging the person in front of me, only to find out that they paid for my drink. Made my day, and also changed my life lol

Edit: I posted on this sub bc I felt like a total asshole and like I fucked up being a decent person, I also fucked the 'pay it forward' up so yknow

UPDATE: I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27M) phone.,"It's been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I'm still trying to work through all of your PM's because I'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don't. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don't know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he'd admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend's phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn't seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. 

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

We got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I've never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. 

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn't know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said ""That isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who I am"" and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don't recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but I don't really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn't sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. 

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don't know how long I stared at my TV screen that said ""Are you still watching: Planet Earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn't know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn't capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. 

I didn't sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I've been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I'll continue working on replying to your PM's, but in the meantime I think I'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

TIFU by unknowingly doping for the entire school year,"This TIFU has been in the making since last September. This is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

Late last summer I started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. Naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. I'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

Though I've always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call I needed to start working out. Beside hitting the gym, I also joined a sharpshooting club, and was I was natural at it. Over the course of a few months I moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. My aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

I'm pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but I sure as hell didn't. In the meantime a cardiologist said ""Tough shit"" and bumped up the meds.

During the course of this school year I was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. Soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. The stakes were high, but I was a stone cold shooter. Later that day checking out my Fitbit, I found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when I had to bicycle over the the range.

Flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. My friend jokingly mentioned that I must've been doping to do so well and the dots connected. I googled ""metoprolol doping"", there it was. I still haven't told anyone, but Reddit. What the hell do I do now?

[Update] Girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. I don't. What are my rights? (Texas),"[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

Long version:

If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.

She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.

The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

So I have my baby daughter!

Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job! 

As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.

Thank you all. ",legaladvice
"AITA for being upset my MIL won't make a ""family quilt"" for me and my husband because we have no kids?","My MIL has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B\*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",AmItheAsshole
"My (36m) wife (33f) was sued, I'm feeling resentment towards her and I don't know how to move past it.","FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I'd rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I'm okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

As the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

My currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I'm feeling towards my wife. Until now I've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I'm the breadwinner I can't help but to feel like I'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. I've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

What did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

She used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""Laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn't know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf. 


Using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn't realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


My wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


I'm leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  My wife didn't think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


Laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


I honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife's harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


My wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don't know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. I need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. Funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. What can we do to move forward?",relationship_advice

"Schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing.","You have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. So many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. Acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. I had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and I had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until I cried so I was forced to give up, not to mention that was a HUGE expense every month some families might not be able to spare. Different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. Turns out I didn't even have acne. I have a very common condition called KP, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. Eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. If you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. I could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

Weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. Their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. These kids essentially have an addiction. The majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. Bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. Also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine BMI and extremely healthy. Not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

I knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. Same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

All in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. I'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. Did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? It is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. Did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? We often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

"UPDATE - [MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

I promised an update so here it is. First off, I want to thank everyone who strongly suggested I go see a doctor ASAP. I went to see an ENT and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. My hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. The tinnitus was still quite bad, so I wanted to see if the doc could help with that. He put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. I saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (This was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

The ringing has gone down considerably, and I'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. It still bothers me at night and while I'm trying to work sometimes. The biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. This has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point I'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

My uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. I'm not planning on suing him. He knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what I was going through. My aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. I haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. They have offered to call me and apologize but I don't want to talk to them. I just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. I'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but I don't care. Fuck that guy. Thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",legaladvice
(Update) My mother said she would kill herself the day I graduate high school (WA),"Hey.

Well, I have some good news. After I made the original post, I talked with my mother about the situation, and what was going on. Once I confronted her about it, she started crying. She said that she had fulfilled her purpose in life, and it's time for me and my brother to fulfill ours. I disagreed, and told her to stop with that, and made her a promise. If she kills herself, then her purpose would not be fulfilled. She wouldn't be able to meet the expectation that I want her at my college graduation, or at my wedding, or at any other celebrations of achievements. I told her that I need her to stay alive and that it's not negotiable no matter, as her simply being somewhere gives hope for future endeavors.

Last Monday, I graduated from high school with my friends, and finished my first year of college at the same time! It was a good time, and I finally get some breathing room for a little bit. I went home, hung out with some people, and then went to bed. To this day, she's alive and well, doing what she would normally do on a day to day basis. I wanted to wait a week to ensure everything would be okay, and I'm glad to report that it is. 

The day that I made the original post, it was closing night of a school play for which I was a part of. With many people in that theater department being on Reddit, a couple of people put the dots together and know that I posted that. To those whom I know IRL, I'm doing okay, and everything will be alright. You know where and how to contact me if you need me, love you guys. To everyone, thank you guys for the kind messages, both on the thread and in PM's. I'm thankful for even in a legal subreddit, people are kind and caring. Love you guys. 

Finally, if you're feeling suicidal, feeling like you don't belong, or going through a hard time, there are places to go to get help. Not only on Reddit, or on any social media, but through phone calls and facilities that you can go to. I know it's posted everywhere always, but if you need someone immediately, at any given time, please call the lifeline below. Thank you, and with love <3

First of all I want to thank everyone for reading my previous post and giving me good advice. Your comments gave me further insight in this situation. I apologize for not giving you guys frequent updates to this situation as I was busy with work.

So after my last post I talked with my friends and my college professors about this mess. Fortunately almost all of them were ready to help. Later during that day we all decided to talk to my friend (21F). We explained to her about the severity of the situation as she was not ready to run away from her house and if she does not act fast she might end up getting married to the old thug ( I know though she might have been frozen in fear, as this is a important decision in her life and she had not made any such decisions before. She is of the type that always follows the crowd and obeys what the others say. ). After lot of convincing from me other friends and professors she finally decided to act. But she was still hesitant to run away as she might bring a lot of suffering to her little sister(14F) who would still be with her parents. So we had to act keeping her little sister in mind. So we convinced her to take her sister with her. We also involved her sister in our plan.

Now the main problem was where they would stay and who will help her get along. Which was managed by our professor *( Dr M. I will not give his full name here. But Dr sir I know you browse this sub so if you are reading this, I thank you million times. ).* Apparently our professor has a extended family thousands of kilometers from where we live, who are happy to let her and her sister stay rent free for sometime.

So on 25 july at 4am in morning we planned her and her sister escape. We made sure she took her important stuff and documents of her and her sister with her. After we had breakfast at one of my friends place. We all left for the train. We made sure she destroys her old sim card. Skip to the day 27 july we arrived at the place and I helped her unpack. Bought some clothes for her and her sister and overall they seem to get adjusted pretty quickly. We still need to take admission to school for her sister (Fortunately there are free schools for girls in India). And she recently landed a good job. So financially she is settled, but I will still be helping her however she needs.

Meanwhile recently we had filed police complaint about her parents and that man. We also informed women's welfare center about this. Things seem normal and I will keep you guys updated as things progress.

TIFU being Jesus,"This happened on Halloween. I imagined the evening going down more or less like this: 

1. Slip into a white robe.
2. Stick on a cactus crown. 
3. Moonwalk out of the house as Jesus. 
4. Remember never to break character. 
5. Hop into an Uber. 
6. Show up to celebrate Halloween with friends. 
7. Go HAM.
8. Go home. 
9. Go sleep.
10. Go for a job interview the next morning.

This is what I would've called a good night. However, after #7, things didn't quite go as planned. Here's how shit actually unfolded:

8. Got shit-faced.
9. Drunk me turned into drunk Jesus. 
10. Fell into my friend's swimming pool and almost drowned after attempting to walk on water.
11. Realized wearing all white, plus water, equals everyone seeing your shriveled up shlong through your tighty whities. 
12. Drunk dialed my religious mother in the middle of the night to tell her I'm proof that Jesus is fake as fuck and that I'm gay, gay, gay. 
13. Unleashed an unholy amount of vomit in the Uber driver's car on the way home.
14. Missed my job interview the following day after waking up laughably late.
15. Realized drunk me set the alarm on my phone two years into the fucking future.

I was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. I understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/NotTheOnion, r/TIFU, r/ELI5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

There aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. The admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda. ",unpopularopinion

TIFU by having sex with my wife.,"Today was about 4 weeks ago. I work in sales and the wife and I went to a big yearly conference at a fancy hotel in a major city a few hours away. It's always a fun conference. Lots of free food and booze, with a very nice hotel room. A 4 day all expenses paid getaway with no kids is always fun, and allows for some much needed one on one time as a couple. 

After our main event and dinner on Friday (and the 3 hour open bar), my wife and I and some clients went to a local pub and had a few more drinks to cap off the night. The wife and I waked back to the hotel instead of ubering (only about 6 blocks) down the walking path next to a nice waterway that flows through the area of town we were in. Beautiful night, drunk, and romantic walk back to the hotel led to some fun time in the room. 

Fast forward to yesterday. We have 2 kids, boy (2) and girl (6). We love our kids and our life. About 2 months ago, we finally decided we were done having kids. We had talked about a third for over a year, but decided we had one of each, and the oldest being 6-7 years older than the youngest would be too big of a gap. So, I scheduled a vasectomy for August 1st. I went in Thursday and got the snip. Easy peasy. Now, just 3 days of relaxing with a bag of peas on my man bits. Probably binge some shows, game a bit, you know... As I'm sitting on our couch watching Lucifer, my wife walks in to the living room with 3 positive pregnancy tests... Wtf. Apparently the proper precautions weren't taken in our night of drunken love making. 

So... Baby #3 it is.

TL;DR I had drunken sex with my wife and didn't use protection or pull. On the day after my vasectomy we find out we're pregnant.

Edit: Thanks for the hardware kind stranger!! Gold, too! Thank you!!

Edit 2: we are excited for our 3rd, we both have good jobs, insurance, and a good home. We have no desire to terminate our pregnancy. Yes, we had decided to stop trying for a third, but we're ok with a happy accident. Thank you for some of your genuine concern.

AITA for telling my girlfriend her dream of moving to another country will never happen?,"My (25M) girlfriend (23F) has always talked about how it's her dream to move to X country. She brought it up on our first date (we've been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

At the beginning, I went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if I would go with her, how crappy our current country is (I'm an expat and she's a local), etc etc 

Recently, however, every few times she mentions it, I'll bring up her spending habits. In the time we've been together, she's spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

The last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she'd need to save to get started. 

After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it's never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

She's called me TA, that I'm trying to control her money, I'm trying to humiliate her, make her feel ""small"" and it's none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing 

IMO she could have made her dream come true long ago, and I was only trying to lay it out for her

TIFU by getting so high I thought I predicted my own death,"This happened last night in a 420-legal state, so no laws were broken in the making of this TIFU. Burner because reasons.

After taking a break from smoking for a few months, I decided to break out an indica-hybrid vape cartridge I bought a while ago and let the good times roll. I've been hitting it the past few days, and each time I get higher than a kite because my tolerance is so low now and I don't know when to stop hitting it.

I was on Facebook yesterday morning when I was sober, and in one of my meme groups saw a screenshot of a post about a 23-year-old college student who died after eating pasta that had been left out five days. The top comment on it was ""he pasta way,"" and that just stuck with me because it was so funny.

Later that night, I was cleaning out my fridge and came across two containers of food I had brought back with me from home (I'm a college senior and the semester started two weeks ago). One of the containers was a tortellini salad, and I noticed it had a ""sell by"" date of four days before. I was about to throw it out, then decided to smell it and try a piece given the proximity of the sell by date. I had one piece of tortellini, decided it might be alright, and put it back to figure it out later.

A few hours later, the high times have come and I'm hitting my vape pen. After watching a Rodney Dangerfield classic, I go up to bed and am lying there when all of a sudden I start feeling a sense of doom. I start imagining every hypochondriac symptom in the book, from chest pain, to stomach pain, to shortness of breath, etc. 

At the same time, all I could see in my head was ""he pasta way"" and started thinking that I was an almost 23-year-old college senior and I ate pasta that was approximately five days expired. I suddenly realized that I never saw the guy's name or where it happened in the screenshot, and started freaking out thinking it was about me. Shortly thereafter the EMT side of me takes over, checks that I have a pulse when I've pretty much convinced myself my heart has stopped, and I basically run an out-of-body patient assessment on myself to make sure I'm alive. I fell asleep, and just woke up after 12 hours.

AITA for demanding access to my fiance's bank accounts?,"Edit 1: Wow, thank you all so much for you input. I will post an update in a day or so

Edit 2: PLEASE STOP GIVING ME AWARDS THIS IS A THROWAWAY ACCOUNT. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE DANK MEMES

The title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

My fiance and I are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, Summer 2021.

I make pretty good money for my age. In fact, I make more money than any of my friends or family, and I would bet I'm in the ""1%"" of my community. I try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. I should also add when we started dating, I was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

My fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. She was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  Since then, she hasn't worked. I really didn't mind at all. I make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

I am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead I just would venmo her some cash weekly. It was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

She has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. I know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  She has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

I shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

I told her I would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so I could see exactly what she was spending it on. I could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but I hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

She blew up. Telling me I wasn't trusting her and how I was the one against joint bank accounts so I should understand her privacy. Yeah, HUGE red flags all over the place.

I talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying I was not respecting her privacy when I'm the one that demands it also.

AITA for asking my coworker why he's married?,"(Throwaway with names changed because I know a few of my coworkers use reddit.)

So there's this guy at my work, James, who makes derogatory jokes about his wife. Any time his spouse comes up in conversation, he'll make one of those 'oh, my wife is such a nag, the old ball-and-chain, *women*, eh?' jokes.  He'll always say it with a big grin and then laugh, but he does it *constantly*.
  
And when I say constantly, I mean constantly.  In the three years I've worked with James, I've only heard him mention his wife without making a joke along those lines maybe three or four times.  It really gets on my nerves to hear him trash talk her all the time.  

Today another coworker of ours said that he was making plans for his anniversary with his wife, and James butted in and said ""oh, yeah, mine's coming up soon, too.  I guess I need to do something or I'll never hear the end of it.""

And I kind of lost my temper and asked him ""If that's the way you feel why are you still married to her?!"" 

James kind of sputtered a bit that he was joking, and I told him that he always talks about being married like it's a burden, and that there comes a point when even the funniest jokes get old, and that his jokes about his wife haven't ever been funny.

It kind of went to an awkward silence until James left for the day.  Some of my coworkers are glad I called him out on it, some of them think what I said went too far.

So AITA here?  Should I apologize to James tomorrow?",AmItheAsshole

From what my dad told me - Him and my mom were both surprised yesterday when the nurse came in and said she could go home.  I don't know the exact details of what happened but I know my dad expressed concern and was surprised they were releasing her. To make a long story short, hours after they got home she was laying in bed and my dad could hear her struggling to call for him. He called 911, by the time the medics arrived she was technically ""dead"" already, they did cpr in the house and on the way to the hospital. They managed to get a heartbeat but 35 minutes or so had passed already. A brain scan at the hospital showed lots of swelling and bleeding in the brain. She was placed on life support, but there wasn't anything they could do. From what I understand, her lungs stopped ""working/making oxygen"" which led to a heart attack.

TIFU by mistaking my coffee thermos for my wife's.,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but happened a while back.

&#x200B;

So for Christmas, my wife got her and me matching coffee thermoses. Hers was copper tinted, mine was stainless steel. apart from that they were identical. I loved it! But after a while, being the absent minded person that I am, mine goes missing. ""No biggie"", I said to myself, ""My wife is staying home today, I'll just take her thermos to work."" So I fixed me up a nice thermos full of black coffee, and headed out the door to work.

This particular day was rather busy, and I had meetings back to back pretty much all morning. I had my thermos and laptop in tow, and was migrating from one conference room to another, when I realized I needed to run to the urination station. So I dropped off my laptop and thermos, ran and relieved myself, then stopped back by my cubical to pick up a couple of reports for the meeting.

While sorting the papers at my desk, I reach over and grab for my thermos and take a big swig of coffee. Immediately, a few alarms and thoughts went through my head. ""This coffee got pretty cold pretty fast today...that's odd. Also I don't remember putting any cream or sugar in it this morning...that's odd. Also what is this texture??""

At this point, still mid-gulp, I shift my eyes down to the top of the thermos, which has a clear plastic lid, and I notice a very large floating blob of mold, which I had just taken a sizable chunk out of. Also I notice the thermos is stainless steel, not copper colored.This was my coffee that had been sitting on my computer desk, in plain sight, for a month. Oh no...I thought as I immediately reach for the trashcan to try and lurch the coffee back out, but to my disappointment it would not come back up. So I run to the bathroom and try a full on puking position to try and get it back up, again no luck. I just knew I was going to get deathly ill, but actually I didn't get sick beyond the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Took my thermos to work, forgot about it. Took my wife's to work a few weeks later. Accidentally drank from my month old coffee and got a nice dose of penicillin and rotten cream.

&#x200B;

Edit:  My apologies to anyone I made chunder this morning!

"If we should blame anyone for the lack of action on Climate Change, it should be Greenpeace.","Because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

Because of their crusade on GMOs, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

Because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

And because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a UNESCO Heritage Site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against DDT.

They personify everything wrong with the environmental movement.

After I (36F) told my Dad and Stepmom (both late 50s) about my engagement and their response triggered me to suddenly remember years of repressed childhood memories and now I do not know how to move forward with our relationship.,"Long post, but there's kind of a lot to this...

Repressed childhood memories coming back? I have heard of this happening but I honestly never thought I'd experience it and holy shit this has been jarring.

My Dad and stepmom have been together since I was age 3, so 33 years.

My childhood was a disaster zone. I have lost large chunks of time where it is a big blank area. I thought it was maybe because I had to take so much Benedryl as a kid because my allergies were so bad that I didn't remember much. Now I think the memory loss is mostly trauma-related. Dark murky memories would come up but I have had no real timeline of my childhood. My mom was married many (many) times and we moved a lot and she had a baby and then another baby and then two more babies. I can sometimes piece together a home we lived in, or what school I went to when, but it is all a blur. I was both my parents first child and the baby of teenage marriage. There was alcoholism and drug use and chaos. Somethings have always stood out... Like the time a stepdad put a gun to my mom's head. Or, my sister being born. Or, times when we had to move out fast and we were told to start throwing the things we wanted into garbage bags and put them into the car.

My mom and I were very close and I was kind of her copilot through all the crap. Crazy as our life was, I loved the hell out of her and she died 2 years ago from cancer. All in all, I have had a kind of hero through it - my dad.

&#x200B;

About a year ago, my dad, stepmom and I were sitting outside around a backyard fire having drinks and real talk. He said something that surprised me, which was that I had lived with them as a kid for a period of about 4-5 years. This was news to me. I had not remembered living with them for that long at all. In my head, it was maybe 6 months. My dad was hurt I did not remember living with them. During that time, my stepmom apologized for being so mean to me during my childhood. I shrugged it off and joked, ""Well, I guess its water under the bridge since I don't remember."" She said, ""no, I was really mean."" And, I said, ""It's okay. All of it has come around. We are good now.""

&#x200B;

Fast forward to two days ago. Over the weekend, the man I love got down on knees and asked me to marry him. Magical moment and we have been very happy. In fact, it's the first relationship I have ever felt safe in, but it takes work and effort for me to trust. I tell my Dad and stepmom the news and watch the whole thing turn and capsize. My dad makes a comment about how I had to beat my sister to a ring (my sister is their daughter/ my half-sister and is in a serious relationship that is also leading to marriage soon). I am struck. I do not feel competitive with my sister and she and I have always celebrated each other's victories. Then, my stepmom asks about where and when and I tell her it might be a year out and she starts making excuses about how she will not be able to go, not willing to go, but tells my dad he can go. I hear this and know my dad will not ever take a trip without her and start to panic that he will not come to my wedding. The comments pile and mount, one on top of the other, until my whole body is trembling. Although I have been sober for over a year suddenly I want nothing more than to drink. But, I do not drink and say everything is ""fine"" when asked and try to leave on a good note to make sense of my feelings in private.

&#x200B;

Something that needs to be explained is that there has always been a strain with stepmom and me. I try hard to do things right, but I am scared of her and always have been. As an adult woman, she still scares me. She is incredibly controlling, powerful, dominating and it is hard. My tactic in avoiding being a target of her passive-aggressive behavior and anger is just to be super nice. Nice all the time. Smile. Swallow. Repeat.

&#x200B;

When I came home from the engagement announcement, it was like the flood gates opened.

One memory cascades into another and another and another.

Suddenly I can recall being 7 and 10 and 12 and all the fear I had as a child in their home.

I remember how much she hated me. The name-calling. The scapegoating.

I remember sucking back tears and being told not to cry at all. I remember hearing all the time ""You're fine.""

I remember the secrets I had to keep about how mean she was. I remember walking down the hallway in our home and being pushed into another room while my dad watched TV in the living room and her whisper-screaming that I was a brat and a terrible child and was ruining her marriage and being told to say nothing to my dad.

I remembered she controlled my sleep habits. I have always slept on my stomach but she required that I slept on my side to face my little sister at night and would come into the room in the middle of the night and catch me on my stomach and wake me up to yell at me and tell me to go back on my side.

She controlled the relationship I had with my dad. We could not do anything she was not a part of, did not supervise, or control.

I remember being cornered again and again. I was targeted and she was after me and it was relentless.

I remember her sisters telling me how sorry they were and that is was not okay for me to be treated this way.

She was a relentless bully.

I remember my sister who is 7 years younger, always trying to protect me and shield me from her mom.

I remember being taunted and teased and made fun of.

I remember one time she yelled at me out front of our house and I got so scared I peed my pants and had to run inside and change.

I remember our neighbors saying that I was safe in their home and if I ever made a mistake in their house they would not tell my stepmom.

I remember when I left my dad and stepmom's house to move back with my mom that they took down all my photos from the walls and told me they would be fostering or adopting a kid to fill my place.

When I moved back with my mom life changed and was chaotic in the way it was with my mom so I think I just forgot all of this stuff and kept going.

But with this sudden flash of remembering everything now, there is just anger. Layers and layers of anger. Anger that my dad did not stand up for me. Anger about what they knew, but I did not. A huge sense of abandonment. What the hell is this? How can I have forgotten all of this? How does it just sweep from view?

&#x200B;

In my head, I rage at her and the main thing I say is, **""Guess what? Now I remember.""**

&#x200B;

I sent them a text. A sheepish way to confront it, but for once I stood up for myself. It was very hard and my whole body quaked and trembled. They did not respond.

&#x200B;

The thing is... they have been trying in the past few years. They moved to my state. They want a relationship with me. She did apologize back in the yard that day. I know my dad loves me and tried in his own way to protect me. I don't think I will get any sense of accountability from them. But, now it's like this mystery has unlocked inside me. I always felt unsafe around her. I never felt like even when she has been nice to me as an adult like I could trust her. Now I know why.

&#x200B;

I think I am about to lose this last remaining chunk of parents I had. My mom is gone and I have continued to work through all the things that happened with her and will head back to therapy to deal with the rest...

&#x200B;

My sister asked what I want to come of all of this. Why put it all towards them? What kind of battle am I setting out to wage? And, I really don't know. I didn't see this coming and I am at a loss. I feel guilty for bringing this up. Like, I am going to wreck the family. But I am also furious. I want them to have to hear it all from me. I want to ask my dad what he did and did not know. I want her confession. I feel like I can already hear my dad telling me not to be so dramatic, and yet, I feel like I will not be able to stuff this one back in.

&#x200B;

How can I rehash something that I only now remember? Is it worth it to even try or do I just salvage a fake relationship for the sake of having one?

I feel bad about feeling sorry for myself. Is there anything that will come from holding them accountable or am I just headed down a path of anger and victimhood?  I wonder if we can even have a relationship from here...

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: I recently told my dad and stepmom I was getting engaged. My dad brought up my sister's likely engagement immediately and completely derailed my news. My stepmom said she wouldn't be coming to my wedding. It brought up years of bullying from my stepmom and neglect from my dad that I had forgotten all about. Now I do not know if I can or want to have a relationship with them and feel insanely guilty for even bringing it up.**

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: Wow. This went... 

I figured this would be my own private story/rant for a few eyes in a corner of Reddit. I did not expect this response. I've been battling with wanting to take it down now. My fiance has encouraged me not to. I've been panicking that my parents will see this. I do not want to hurt them. There is no part of me that wants that. Even in anger. I just want them to know and be honest, without downplaying what it actually was. Not sure that will happen. Pretty unlikely, but its a want. As for what to do about it. I will head off to EMDR and have a handful of referrals for Monday. I will take the ""Damaged Old Person's"" advice (thank you) and move slowly here and get help and not go scorched earth just yet. 

Thanks for the help, encouragement, and congrats. 

As for my partner, which a few posts have asked about... I think he has been a huge reason this is coming out. I think the security of our home and relationship, plus lack of booze as a coping strategy, has meant that now there is the opportunity to actually feel things? I dunno. New territory. He has been hugely supportive in all areas of my life. He is sober, too. A processor. A thoughtful person and we have sat and read some of the responses together and appreciated the insights and conversation. 

As for those questioning validity of my memories, or repressed childhood stuff? New territory also. Like I said at the top, I had heard of this but didn't know it was an actual thing till I was in it. I can only speak to my experience right now as it is occurring and it's been like a download of fresh information complete with recalling my home, surroundings, time of day, where I stood, where others stood, facial expressions, tone, who was there, what was said... So, no my brain didn't just fabricate a false set of memories. I feel the truth of all of these things in my core. This stuff was in me and there is not a question of its reality. The blanks have just been filled in. It feels like a very unfortunate Aha moment. 

Thanks for all of those who have shared their own personal stories of hardship and pain... Man, some of us have walked some really tough roads. I'm sorry for you all, too. Someone shared a link to an article about how isolating abuse is. It's true. Makes me feel crazy. There is a strange solace in knowing others are out there powering through their own pain, too.

International Women's Day should focus more on improving the quality of lives and education of the women who suffer the most versus Western Feminists patting each other on the back for being women.,"The people whose voices need to be heard the most are the voiceless women who suffer under patriarchy and poverty.

AITA for wanting a divorce from husband who lost 200k on bitcoin?,"&#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for 10 years. For our entire relationship, I have brought the majority of the money into the home. I contribute 75% of that. I don't mind, really. It's not something I think about and I have always considered it ""our"" money. Our country (Switzerland) is really expensive and I grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. When I had the chance to go to university, I studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. Years later, I make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.

We decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. I would check on the accounts every once in a while but, I haven't been checking regularly. A few weeks ago, I was thinking about buying a Model 3, since it has recently come to our country and I've fancied it for some time. I played with the numbers and while figuring out if I can afford it or not, I realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. There was 300k CHF/USD missing.

When my husband got home, I showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. This is about 25% of our savings. Besides being shocked and angry, I cannot help to feel that he stole from me. He put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. I was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. They think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. But I honestly just want to get divorced. If he is capable of doing this, how can I trust him ever again? AITA for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? AITA for thinking about divorce?

&#x200B;

Edit: To clear a few things. We always talked about where the money should go. What things to invest in, etc. I always thought he was really open about it and I trusted him... because he is my husband. I work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as I do. After going to work every day, making more decisions about money when I came home wasn't something I wanted to do. That's why I wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. Also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. I don't think that was clear above. So we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.

Edit: If he had doubled our money or ""won"" in some way, would I be feeling the same way? Partially. I would be angry for him not talking about this with me. This is a large sum, too large not to discuss. I would be happy because I would have more money. Who wouldn't be happy if they had more money in their home accounts? But I would have stepped in and taken control of everything because I see all of this as gambling and that's not what I would like to do with money.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by accidentally giving my entire family an indirect unholy facial UPDATE,"Two days back, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ael0wt/tifu_by_using_holy_sanctified_oil_as_lube/) happened.
Here's the **TL;DR** from it:
Used oil as lube, accidentally shot semen into the bottle. Turns out oil had religious incantations recited upon to ward off evil, and grandpa will be using it tonight on his hair and beard.

Right after the post, a lot of people asked me to throw the oil away but I hesitated because my grandpa had apparently been feeling better ever since he started using the oil even before I came in it, so I didn't know how to waste it. I could've asked the Imam (Local mosque leader) to do the same stuff he did on the oil in a new bottle, but he's out of town for this month. So I just put the bottle where it was and he even used it once right after, unfortunately.

Next two days, I stayed over at my cousin's place and just got back this morning. Right as I came back, Mom recommended me to massage my hair with the oil given by the Imam as it felt ""soothing"". As she was saying it, I visualised my demonic jizz nuclei laughing and slowly sliding into the bottle, and then being mixed in it throughout. I snapped back, and acted like I wasn't convinced to do it. She told me it was my choice, and that everyone in the house (Parents, grandparents and siblings) had done it and felt better. I rushed to the bathroom to check the bottle because I couldn't believe what she said, and the bottle was nearly empty with the slightly bubbly end left over for me. I froze over the realisation that each of my family member had used my mayonnaise infused sanctified oil on their faces and hair, and I haven't been able to look at any of them in the eye ever since I left the bathroom. 

Not sure if I should tell my brother about this now, or keep my mouth completely shut at this point. 

**TL;DR**: Came into a bottle of sanctified oil, delayed disposing it off and now my entire family has used the oil on their face and hair

Cheating Wives,"A guy thought his wife was cheating on him. He waited for her to leave that night and jumped in a cab to follow her. By following her, he found out she was working in a whore house.


The guy says to the cabbie, ""Wanna make a $100?""


The cabbie says, ""Sure, what do I have to do?""


The guy replies that all the cabbie has to do is go inside the whore house, grab his wife, put her in the back of the cab, and take them home.


The cabbie goes in. A couple of minutes later, the whore house door gets kicked open, and the cabbie starts dragging out this woman who is kicking, biting, punching, and fighting all the way to the cab.


The cabbie opens the door to the cab, throws the girl inside, and tells the man, ""Here! Hold her!""


The man looks down at the girl and yells to the cabbie, ""THIS AIN'T MY WIFE!""


The cabbie replied, ""I KNOW. IT'S MINE... I'M GOING BACK IN FOR YOURS!""

"GF's dad filled out her mail-in ballot, forged her signature, and sent her a photo of the completed ballot with the caption 'If anybody asks, you voted.'","My girlfriend was furious. Not only is this obviously illegal, but it's a huge breach in trust for my girlfriend and it totally defeats the purpose of voting for her, her  brother, and everybody else that this happens to. To be clear, my girlfriend and her parents DO NOT share political views, and they know that. 

I just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the Democratic system.

Edit: This is in Arizona.

Edit 2: We found out that the ballot has not been mailed yet. We are having her father send us the parcel instead of having him ""throw it out"" and risk it being submitted. The reason the ballot did not come to us is because he signed her up for early voting and put his address as the place to mail it. We live in a different city. ",legaladvice
TIFU by deleting Reddit's #1 top post of all time,"Happened just now. Sorry for my possible slips as English is not my mothertongue. I mostly only lurk around, but this time I decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

I've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. Usually when I get depressed at home I start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because I like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

See, since I'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""Accounts"" folder and terminating the ones I don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn't get it by registering at the service directly. I'll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal. But little did I know.

Later in the day I get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some Imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. In addition to that I still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. Being the total jackass of an idiot that I am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, I decide to google the #1 top Reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on Imgur (yeah, the one about the Senate, with a total of whole damn 310K updoots). I open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise Satan himself. Of course Imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? It can't be this bugged, right? (I hadn't clicked one by then YET). So I click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this TIFU.

AITA because I refuse to spend money on my ex's kids despite being well off?,"I have a 16 year old son and he has 4 half siblings who are all younger than him. I was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. 

Obviously that didn't work out because she got pregnant (I did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, I'm a dad now anyway)I asked her to abort, she told me she'd changed her mind, and she kept the baby.

I wasn't thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established I set about paying child support and that was it. I had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and I was still a kid myself.

After a few months though I felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so I put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and I'm so glad and grateful that I got to be his dad.  I was 18 when I had him, and over the years I was lucky enough that I was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so I'm able to give my son experiences that I never had. 

He chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he'd always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he'd get yelled at because he's the oldest, etc. 

His mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. She is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. 

It was his birthday last week and as a gift I bought him a car, which he'll be needing soon anyway and which I've had the cash aside for for *years*. When his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me I that I'm a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because I've 'never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it's obvious his dad is spending money on him' ... I snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids I have no obligation to just so she doesn't feel bad? 

She said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that I was selfish for having a fund for ONLY my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. I told her that's an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. 

She's normally pretty level headed so I honestly have no idea why she thinks it's acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- I've never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, I just want him to have the best I can give him.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for spiking my leftovers with Ghost Pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson,"So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. 

Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by suggesting Twin Peaks as a joke for the location of a company meeting.,"About two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.

As a joke I wrote in Twin Peaks as one of the suggestions.

I am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. The trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a HUGE margin.

I am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most RSVP's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.

The day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. In the ENTIRE process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. The organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. The waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.

About an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. By then it was too late. The money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.

I have to hand it to upper management. They powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. Although he did start the meeting with. ""I was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but I think I know why so many of you joined us today."" This drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.

Other than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.

It took all of 3 hours after the meeting for IT to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.

I was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.

I came in this morning and was informed I am to receive a write up for this. They are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. They understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at Twin peaks.

TL:DR Suggested Twin Peaks as a joke location for meeting. Bosses did not research Twin Peaks at all and we had a quarterly meeting at the location. I got written up for it. ",tifu

TIFU by causing about 40 people to fall down an escalator at the airport.,"Okay, it wasn't today but it was recent. That's all I can give you.

I was at a UK airport and as a perk of my job I had a business class ticket to fly to Brazil. I'd never flown first class before and felt pretty giddy and excited, i mean, why wouldn't I?

I was going to Brazil, for 3 weeks, busines class in a five star hotel I hadn't had to pay for. To make it even better as it was technically a business trip I was getting paid to be there.

I'm heading to the departure gate and I ended up on one of those long escalators, you know the kind they have in airports that you silently note to yourself ""hey, that's a big escalator.""

I'm going down, got my backpack on, my headphones in and I'm in a good mood, such a good mood I decide to jump the last few steps, just because I'm a little giddy thinking about all those Brazilian girls, some sunshine, some cheap booze and absolutely NO stuffy office and intolerable moody co-workers.

So i jump, hit the plate at the bottom and the fucking thing locks up and makes a high pitched noise. It doesn't gradually come to a stop, it just stops. 

It's a busy airport, it's a busy escalator too. I turn around and see people tumbling down this thing, crashing into people and more people falling. An alarm goes off and people in uniforms come running out shouting into walkie talkies.

I try my absolute best to disappear into the crowd, another shocked bistander wondering what's going on.

I see a lady bleeding from her nose, a man with a probably broken arm, kids crying and I know it's my fault. I feel horrible, but not just horrible, worried. Worried i won't be going anywhere. What will work say?!

I head to the departure gate and bored my flight without issue, the business class is severely tainted. I spend the whole trip worried I'll be arrested at the other end, every possible scenario goes through my head.

I get off scot free but I'm still feeling bad about it so i thought I'd come and tell all of you about it, so you can judge me instead.

My girlfriend of 3.5 years kisses ex at sisters wedding right before I'm about to propose,"My girlfriend (24f) of the past 3.5 years told me that when she went to her sister's wedding without me over the weekend that she kissed her ex. 
We had a trip planned for this upcoming week to go to Spain and I was going to ask her to marry me - she was well aware this was going to happen. She always told me there was nothing she wanted more. 
She tells me she was drunk and it ""just happened"". 
I'm so hurt right now. She's said how sorry she is many times, and I believe her, but I feel so betrayed. 
We've had a great relationship up to this point, I've loved every minute of it. To add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. 
This hurts me to my core to think that someone I wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. Out of all the women I've ever dated she was the one I was least worried about this happening with. 
She tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, I just don't know if I can move on. 
We live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
I just don't know what to do. I still love her to pieces  but idk if I can get past this. 
Do I still go on the trip with her? Do I try and make this work? I'm certainly holding off on the proposal for now.

A couple of days ago, my girlfriend who I lived with left our apartment while I was at work, claimed to her family and mutual friends that I'd been physically abusing her, and blocked me on everything. I have no idea what's going on. There weren't any major problems in our relationship that I could see, and we just had consensual sex last night. The very last time I spoke to her before all of this happened, she was perfectly fine, kissed me goodbye before I went to work, and everything was normal.

Then I got a call from my dad toward the end of the day asking me calmly if I've been hitting my girlfriend. I didn't know what he was talking about, and then she told me.

I rushed home, and she had gotten all of her stuff and is staying either with her family, or a friend of hers. My Facebook account is blowing up, and I have no idea what to do.

None of what is being said is true, and I don't know if someone is just playing a cruel joke on me. A few people even mentioned that the police were called, but I haven't heard anything as of yet.

The last major argument we had was probably in February around Valentine's Day. We were going through some financial trouble, the stress got to us, and we were both getting upset with each other over petty, household things. She was my best friend, the person I could rely on to be there for me, and the person I would be there for always, no matter what. We were definitely planning on getting married. It wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. Her family had basically accepted me into the family. I was close with both her mom and her dad. I only called them both once each -- neither of them answered my calls. I called my, I don't know, ex? just twice. No answer. She blocked me on every social media platform of hers that I know of. I asked a couple of friends, but they are being distant with me -- just one word answers, or ghosting me.

What the fuck is happening here? We'd always been up front and honest with each other, and our communication was stellar.

tl;dr: I guess my girlfriend decided she wasn't happy in the relationship or something, and instead of breaking up with me, she left behind my back completely out of the blue, and claimed to everyone that I've been physically abusing her. I have no idea what's going on.",relationship_advice

AITA for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that I taught his siblings because of the custody arrangement?,"Edit/Update:

The moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.

I know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.

I spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.

I have talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.

They agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.

However, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.

I reached out to a teacher in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. 

I need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again, it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.

I don't know what else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.

I'll be meeting my son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.

I also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.

Thanks everyone.

I have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.

This was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time to teach him properly.

Also, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.

The major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.

My older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.

Part of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and I told him I couldn't.

And now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.

He is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll do the finances.

This was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.

I'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.

My oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.

Our Sunday family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.

He accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.

Should I have done all this differently?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?,"My (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. She made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. The jokes all seemed lighthearted and I just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. Fast forward to our 20 week scan. We go in super excited and nervous. I don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. 

We go in and find out we are having a boy. My wife immediately bursts into tears and I hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. She doesn't stop crying the whole day. I let her calm down and try to comfort her. 

It's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. She refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. Family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. 

Now that it's been nearly a month I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. It's just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip. I felt awful but I feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous. 

My wife and I made up but she's still acting the same and I'm getting upset again. 

AITA for being upset about this? I love the baby beyond words and am just upset she doesn't seem to anymore.",AmItheAsshole

"Marriage between 2 people isn't ""unnatural"" or ""outdated,"" people just don't want to accept the fact that all relationships take hard work, commitment, and sacrifice.","You've probably heard the statistic that half of all marriages in the U.S. end in divorce. You've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
This is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. The reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of Disney fairytale. What a joke. But this is really ingrained in our culture. Think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

&#x200B;

The fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. They take commitment. They take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

What does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*It means... not scrolling through the Facebook or IG pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. Saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if I was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*It means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""She/he was mean to me."" ""I deserve this."" ""She doesnt love me anyway. I can sleep with someone else now."" - Nope. you made a commitment. Stick by it and work on your issues.

\*It means... putting down the video games, the TV controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*It means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&#x200B;

These are just a few examples of things I see so often that kill marriages. The truth is that marriage between 2 people can be amazing and last a lifetime, but you have to work hard at it and ignore a lot of what our selfish, hyper-consumer culture tells us about how to behave.",unpopularopinion
TIFU by opening an incognito tab in a board room full of managers. NSFW,"A few nights ago before bed, I opened an incognito tab and used a website that should be closed immediately after. I guess I was tired so I accidentally minimized the tab instead and went to bed. A few days went on and I hadn't used my laptop (my clinical job doesn't usually require it) but yesterday I had a council meeting and had to present some work I'd been writing for the unit. I walk into a small conference room with all my managers and their bosses, ready to present. My direct manager is to my left and to my right is a guest manager from another unit. As I get ready to share my work and open my laptop, open to Word, everything looks fine. I present and everyone loves the ideas, etc. and my boss asks me to write her an email summary of what I presented. I then go to click on my google app and out pops a black and orange screen with obscene scenes being portrayed. Cue blushing and panic. I close it as quickly as I can and look over to my left with my direct manager who seems to be focused on something else so okay we're fine I think but then I look over to my right and the guest manager is trying to look anywhere but at me... completely red. I play it off as nothing happened and finish the meeting as best as I can but you can feel the awkward energy radiating from her. Hopefully I never have to apply for a transfer to her unit... or see her again!!!

Reporters are harassing us after a friend's tragic accident and posting inappropriate photos and quotes. What are our rights?,"I have a friend who was badly injured in a tragic accident. Somehow, the media was on the scene and took photos, splashing them over several outlets with a sensationalized title. They had been constantly harassing me, my family, her family, her friends, her coworkers, and her neighbors by calling daily. They camped out at the hospital grounds and followed us around, and some even snuck upstairs using our names, which is definitely illegal. We called the police and hospital security multiple times but by the time they got there, the reporters ran off.

It has been such a hard time for her and everyone close to her. The last thing we need is to be followed and harassed. Finally, after the 5th call, I asked the reporters to find it in their hearts to take down the photos of my friend that were partially exposing her private parts and injuries, so she can maintain her dignity. I also politely, but sternly, asked them to please stop calling everyone as we were still processing what happened. 

Of course, these ""reporters"" are the actual scum of the earth, devoid of a soul. The one I spoke with said they would remove the photos and stop calling. They did neither. The photos are still up months later and they called for another 2 days. I told them that I did not want anything I said to be published and that I am an anonymous friend. Instead, they made up quotes, saying that I said she was healing well when she was not. 

Even though I never game them my full name, they already had it and plastered it all over the article, including under a photo of her with another made-up quote. After it was published, I got 50+ calls and messages from acquaintances berating me for sending photos to the media, when I did no such thing. I was nowhere near the accident. That took another few days to clear up but I felt that was slanderous and purposefully misleading.

This happened in NYS. I have a very low opinion of reporters at the moment. They made my life and my friends' lives so much more difficult in an already difficult time, just to sell a sensationalized story. Do I have legal grounds to sue them for (1) harassing us (we have 2 official police reports with witnesses), (2) publishing nude photos without consent, and (3) misquoting under my full name without my permission?

*Edit to the 1st paragraph to make it more vague, as some have been able to deduce the story, which goes to show how widespread it was. Also, please do not PM requesting the full story. The point of my post was to figure out what to do with reporters that were harassing us. Isn't it ironic if you're doing the same? ",legaladvice

AITA for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my GF wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?,"To preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

Little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

I occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition I've had since i was born. over the last year or so my GF(R) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

For the Issue at hand. R is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

Edit: to answer some FAQs, She doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, Dr death, YMH, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. I love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when I'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

I've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for THAT long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. I never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how I felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and I feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. I'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",AmItheAsshole

&#x200B;

Groom and I had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. I'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because I've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. In fact, since knowing him, I've talked him through each of his break ups. We've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, I helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. I'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. I've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

A month after his engagement, Groomsman Invitational Boxes went out. We have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. Of the original high school group, I was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. This obviously stung, but I maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. It triggered my depression for a solid month where I questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the Groom and I had a talk.

He said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which I'm sure it was. He told me that I was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the Bride would not sign off on my involvement. Apparently, I had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. She'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). I'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. He said it was tearing him up inside, and I believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. He said that he'd let her know that I knew about how she felt towards me and that I'd be reaching out to talk about it. So I messaged the Bride through text and DM, saying (paraphrased), ""Hey! I'm so sorry if anything I've said has upset you. Can we meet sometime and talk? I'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" The Bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final Groomsmen Invitation Box goes out to another friend.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the Bride, Groom, and I are hanging out. Groom and I are talking, and I'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so I ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. The conversation leads us here...

Groom: Hey man, I wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

Me: Sure. What's up?

Groom: I was wondering if you would want to usher for me? It's no big deal if you can't, but I want you to be there for me if you can, you know? Like, be a part of the wedding.""

Me (very touched): Yeah! Of course I can, dude. Anything for you two.

Groom: Thank you so much. You know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. I know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

Me: I'll have to see if I can leave work early, but I'm already there, man. Thanks for thinking of me!

A week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so I shoot him a text saying, ""Hey man! Big day's this weekend. Just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. I got the time off with my boss, so I can definitely make it. Just let me know."" He returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""Yeah man, we would still like you to usher. I'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. Thanks for helping us out!"" I'm a little put out, but I persevere. At least he asked me to be an usher. That's something, right?

Morning of the wedding comes around and I'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time I should show up to the reception to start helping. Then Bride messages me asking for a favor. These messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages I had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. Bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. Can I do this for a bride, on her wedding day? Sure. Oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **Sure.**

At this point I should have stopped and asked myself, ""Why am I helping so much? Why didn't I ask for their money up front? Should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" Hindsight. 20/20. With the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while I go pick up the appetizers. Thank God I played as much Tetris as I have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. I text the Bride to let her know we've got everything together and I'd see them at the reception. Once again, left on read.

I get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. I find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. The venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. So I have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

Since guests were already seating themselves, I immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. It was a fucking mess. At one point, I was so down about the situation that I literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" To start, the place cards were in no discernible order. They were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. I should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. We weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. The best part is, I say ""we"" because at this point I met my ushering-peers; they were the Grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (I'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. When I asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. We did this at the wedding last year.""

After finding out that, to the Groom, I was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. They ask me to stay for a drink, but I can't because I'm still ushering. As I step back behind the name card table, I take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. To my right, I see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. I look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and I wonder, how did I get here?

Wedding kicks off & in the rare instance I can speak to Bride & Groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. I also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should I do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  I'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when I walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. I can understand this. Maybe they're burned out. Maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

Now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the Groom approaches me.

Groom: Hey, thanks again for your help. I was wondering if I could borrow you again?

Me: What's up?

Groom: Did you drive here? We have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

Me: ... how far is the hotel?

Groom: 10 minutes away.

Me (for a Groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... Sure.

Get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, I'm hungry. Groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. He goes to get changed, I say I'm gonna grab food & come back. Groom asks for food for he & Bride. I say sure. Bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. Sure. Then she asks the room at large who'd like food. Now I'm buying food for almost the whole after party. Cousin says she'll venmo me when I get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **Sure.**

Come back, cousin is passed out. Drunken guests grab whatever food they see. Groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. I grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. At this point, I'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that I never really had a best friend to begin with. I feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. I went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. This was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how I thought it would. I've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and I'm left wondering how I could have been such a chump, and how many other times I'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

The advice I'm hoping for is, how can I go about expressing how terrible a time I had at his wedding without insulting him, if I should do that at all, how can I develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? Also, I feel like the missing puzzle piece is the Bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what I did to her. I know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. How can I start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? Should I just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200B;

tl;dr ""Best Friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

Michigan. I was denied a restraining order because my abuser said I'm kinky and because of my sexual history.,"In October, in the process of getting out of an abusive relationship, I filed for a restraining order and filed a police report and gave evidence such as text messages in which my abuser admitted to doing it. I gave the same copies of texts to the police when I filed the police report.

At the protective order hearing, his defense was that it was consensual because I have a sexual history involving BDSM, and that I was simply trying to ""punish"" him. We did not have that kind of sexual relationship, and hearing the judge asking him questions about my sexual history was extremely upsetting. They were laughing and joking about how ""you'd think it would be the other way around"" that I was a more experienced submissive than my ex was an experienced Dominant. I brought a eyewitness but the judge did not want to hear from my witness at all. He said it sounded like a ""bad breakup"" and gave me a restraining order for a few weeks as a ""cooling off period.""

Today I found out that the prosecutor is charging him. I know that there is a higher burden of proof for criminal charges than there is for a restraining order, so surely I should have been granted an actual restraining order, right? I want to know if I have any recourse for how the judge acted during the restraining order hearing, because it definitely put me in danger, and I worry that others will be put in danger too. I don't care about trying to get money, I just really feel like this is not the series of events that should have occurred. Is there anything I can do?

[Update] Wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us,"A lot of people seem to care and I got a ton of encouraging messages, so I will post an update for you.

We live in northern Europe, for those that asked.

&#x200B;

Thanks for everyone that gave me their advice. A lot of you have assumed schizophrenia or the rare Capgras delusion. Some of you assumed she was cheating which is something I won't even address.

Thinking about it, Capgras really fitted the symptoms but I couldn't just accept that, still hoping she was somehow fucking with us or that it was something mild and temporary and I just overreacted.

After they took her in, i drove to the mental institute to give an exact explanation of what happened in the last week. The psychiatrist assumed some sort of schizophrenia. They told me they will look after her and I should go home to my children. I felt like i was drunk the entire time, I couldn't close a single eye at night.

The psychiatrist called me yesterday evening and asked me to come to her office. I left my children with their grandparents and drove for what it felt like an eternity.

She told me straight up that she strongly assumes that its Capgras. She never saw a case of Capgras before but it fits everything she gathered. She explained to me how the past 2 days went down.

My wife arrived there, being extremely hostile. She was put in a 'safe room' where she couldn't hurt herself. She calmed down after a couple of hours and the psychiatrist was able to talk to her. The good news was, that she quickly opened up and explained to her what she thinks. She 'knows' that her family and most of her friends have been swapped by clones. She assumed that we, 'the clones', have sent police officers to get her and that she was scared of what we might do to her. She flew in the first place because she felt that we might attack her but mostly to get some space. She still isn't sure if the 'clones' are malicious or not. That explains why she was distrusting me and always searched for some signs in me and the kids. My wife said that we act exactly like the real ones and how perfect our disguise was, but she knew that we aren't real because she didn't feel any love towards me or the kids or her own parents. Writing this down feels like a lance piercing through my chest.

She also told her how she was trying to hide her distrust of us, because she couldn't be sure if we know that she knows that we aren't the real 'we'. Her delusion that we've been swapped came to her 1 day before I noticed it. 10 days ago. She woke up, looked at me and knew that I wasn't the same anymore, not the real one. Same with the kids, her parents and her friends. She hadn't had those thoughts before.

She asked the psychiatrist if she knows who swapped us or why it happened or if this happens often. She tried to avoid answering her question because she wasn't sure how my wife would react if she gave in or took her out of her delusion. My wife asked her when she can get out again, the psychiatrist asked her if she wants to get out and she answered that she's ok being here. It gives her some comfort being with professionals and she now has time to think. It helps that my wife is a nurse and that she respects doctors a lot.

The psychiatrist explained to me, how they will try to slowly deconstruct her delusion and that it can take a short or a very long time until she fully recovers. She explained to me that it's possible that she might never truly recover. But the fact that she opened up about it and doesn't necessarily feel scared is a good sign. Im still not allowed to see her as it could make her panic. She apperas to be completely clear of mind about everything else. She knows names, dates, places, facts and everything she knew before. Only the thought that we aren't the real ones is now a fact for her. Now I wait, till they have some good or bad news of how she develops.

Writing all of this down really helped me. I'm trying to wrap my head around this situation and im mostly scared for her and the children. I can't hide how distressed I am and that my wife isn't at home so I explained to them that she is in a mental hospital and she has to recover. The 4yo doesn't really understand but the other two took it surprisingly well. It helps that they heard all those morbid stories my wife told them from the hospital i guess. They asked me  when they can see her and i told them that i dont know, but i hope it will be soon. I havent felt this empty and i dont know if i should be sad or angry. fuck

Thanks to everyone here that helped me. I feel like im in a waiting room at the dentist. Its so surreal. I feel better knowing what the problem is, but worse not knowing when it ends.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (27M) Have Unknowingly Been Using My GF's (27F) Ex's Molded Dildo to Get Her Off,"Previous post:

So, we had the talk. My relationship is over. After some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late Saturday, I brought it up. She again tried to deflect and change the subject, but I demanded we stay on topic. I told her outright how I felt, how I thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. She tried to play it off like I was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. Then she spun it into a penis size issue. I kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her Ex-BF and NOT the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. I told her I wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and I was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

The conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say I have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. I knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so I outright told her the relationship was over.

Thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. They were helpful and confirmed my feelings. Now I guess I will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. I'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

AITA for my sister and her bf breaking up?,"sister, teri
sisters bf, tom

so I'm most likely the asshole but here we go. 

so my sister started dating this guy 2 years ago, everything was fine until last week. 

now a few dates in Tom tells her that he is a father to a boy and a girl and that he has custody of them every 3d weekend and whenever he wants during the holidays. 
teri was ok with this surprisingly as she is subbed to heaps of child free pages. 

last week I found out that they wanted to move in together, he was looking for 2 bed places so the kids have a room.
I thought that she would be fine with this, turns out she is not. 

she complained to me a few days back that she hated that the kids had to tag along and that she hopes he looses custody of them so they can have more one on one time. I asked her if she was joking and she replied. no why would I want fucking crotch goblins living with me. I then repeated so it's a joke right? and she said no. 
so I asked her why she is moving in with someone who has kids, and her response was, he is hot. 

I told her that she should break up with him if she hates the kids so much as they are a package deal and she got mad at me and left. 

I then got a message where she sent me a photo of some weed and the caption, custody no more. (he has monthly drug tests)

I automatically called him and let him know and provided proof with the photo. 

tori is now a single woman and is fucking pissed at me, my mum has also taken her side and now I'm regretting it.

"LPT: If you're buying a home printer for occasional use, get a laser printer; they're more expensive up front but way more economical in the long run.","Edit: WOW! Front page! I'm on cloud 9 right now. 

To answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. Laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. Inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. Kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven. 

As for photos, many people have pointed this out and it's a valid concern. Many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. You still have options.

TIFU by exposing myself to my wife's friend,"This happened on Friday, and I'm just now able to relive it without experiencing Tourette-like outbursts of random noises and profanity from my extreme discomfort from the embarrassment.

I'm sitting on the toilet in the downstairs bathroom (which is right by the front door of our house), I have the door mostly closed, but it's not latched. Doorbell rings, my wife answers it, it's her friend Jen. Jen comes in the house. I should mention that Jen is a friend/neighbor we've known for just under a year and I don't really know her that well, which, for me, makes this worse.

I'm just finishing up, getting ready to wipe. I pull on the first piece of toilet paper, and as the toilet paper unrolls this big, and very fast spider comes running from behind the roll, brushing against my hand. Instinctively, I jump up and away from this spider, as I do this, the door to the bathroom opens, there's Jen, we both scream, me because my fight or flight (in this case flight) response automatically kicks in from my lizard brain thinking I'm getting attacked by this spider, and Jen seeing her friend's husband with his pants and underwear down between his legs leaping toward her screaming.

A lot of apologies and light uncomfortable laughter afterwards, and I haven't slept well since.

TL;DR: TIFU by exposing myself to my wife's friend when I jumped from a spider while sitting on the toilet, right when my wife's friend walked into the bathroom.

(US) ex seeking full custody of the kids for the 4th time. Feels like I'm going crazy.,"I posted this in r/divorce before. Adding updates as to what has unfolded. 

Throw away account because he stalks every thing I do. Just to be safe.

Two years ago I (now 29F) was out of the blue handed separation papers from my husband (now 30m)... this led to one of the worst times of my life. I found out he was having an affair. Was taking our 3 children to her house and telling them not to tell me or they'd get in trouble. His behavior toward me changed dramatically. He became extremely abusive and the police were called to our home. (He was forcing me to move out but at the time I had nowhere to go, I had no money on my own.) Two long days later he's charged with a domestic violence charge, and I get granted a temporary protective order. We get to court, judge drops it because he's calm in court but warns him if he even touches me he will go to jail. Eventually he pleads guilty to his charge and gets a year probation. We go to court again. He wants full custody. Drags me through the mud. Judge said no way and gave us a 50/50 split. He's still with the woman he has an affair with. I ask for 6 months of no paramours around the children because he wanted to move her in immediately and I believed the kids needed some healing time. Judge agrees and adds it. He's livid. In the 6 month period he gets her pregnant. We go back to court again after the 6 months.  He again asks for full custody. Judge denies and keeps it at 50/50 because it's working for the kids. The other woman however we find out after court had moved in about a month before the 6 month period had ended. He told the kids, again, to lie to me or they'd be in trouble. Some time passes, I meet an amazing man. We were good friends first, then decided to try dating. Dating is perfect. I introduce him to the kids. The kids adore him, he adores the kids. It's going nearly perfect. Except my ex is flipping out because how dare I move on. How dare I involve him with the kids. I don't deserve to move on he claims. More time passes. We move in together. Kids have their own rooms. They love it here! My divorce finally becomes final. Ex gets married the very next day after we are granted the divorce. The next day after that he files a show cause because I moved in with boyfriend. He wants full custody again. My youngest then tells my mother that some strange things have been going on with daddy and she doesn't think it's right. Daddy tells her not to trust mommy's boyfriend because he's going to hurt them and touch them in the no no places. This goes on. More and more of these comments are revealed that my ex is telling them my boyfriend is going to hurt them. We go for our pre-trial for the show cause, it's granted to move forward. Date is set. Not a week later I get a call from cps that they need to investigate an allegation that my boyfriend touched my oldest. We do the interview, cps clears him completely. It's obvious he hasn't done anything because he's never left alone with the kids. I'm in charge of baths, etc. However, the cps worker thinks she has been abused, but she was coached to say it was my boyfriend. They seem to think it was my ex or my ex's father or my ex knows it's his father and he's covering it up. So now they are investigating his family instead. We are waiting for the results and What is uncovered. 

Im shaking all the time. I haven't slept right in days. I can barely eat. My baby was hurt. I knew it in my gut. It was attempted to be pegged on my boyfriend but they found no way for the allegation to be possible. 

It's all a mess. This is beyond who deserves custody. This is who hurt my daughter. How can I get justice for my daughter and help her heal from this .. 

Update: my boyfriend has been 100% cleared of any allegations. It was ruled unfounded, as we expected. However, the ex has decided to ignore our custody agreement and only give two of our three kids to me. We did week on week off. When I went to get them at our usual meetinf spot a month and a half ago, I was met by an off duty police officer that was a friend of his family letting me know I would only be getting two of the children as the oldest is now ""terrified of her mother and the mother's boyfriend."" I attempted to call another police officer but they said it was a civil matter. I filed a show cause for him violating the custodial agreement. Tomorrow is our court date. I have not seen my oldest child in over a month, have not been allowed to talk to her, or my questions about how she is doing are ignored. Ex just won't talk to me at all. 

My attorney says this is an obvious and clear cut case of parental alienation and it's obvious he wasn't getting his way so he escalated his claims to attempt to get custody. 

Obviously, I don't think this is going to be a cake walk. However, I just want to know I'm not crazy and this is actually an attempt at parental alienation and I'm not going to lose my children to a monster who is an expert of maniuplation.

AITA for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?,"A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I've never objected to people crossing our land as I'm an avid hiker and don't want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

Anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It's basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she'll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it's a multi day hike). 

It made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

Now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It ""feels like"" 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren't connected to an endless supply of water.

They were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I've drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. 

They had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl's bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way. My wife says I should have filled them up, but IMO so long as the little girl is okay I don't think they deserved anything given their attitude.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU a marriage," Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

 So I sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. I live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... So common that I sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 One particular day I dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that I had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. So as we arrive I mention this to the rider:

Me - Hey I just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

Rider- No, must be the wrong house

Me- Nope, he walked right out of that side door. I dropped him off at *names local bar* His girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (I had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) You guys having a family/friend vacation?

Rider- This is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. Nobody lives here but me and my wife and I've been in NY for work for the past 4 days. 

Awkward silence as we both come to the realization. 

He got out and I drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth.

My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,"My wife and I are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

When I was in my 20s I donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (I literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). I've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. Always. And she has always said she's okay with it.

Fast forward to yesterday I answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" Obviously I have no idea what the fuck is going on, so I ask her to explain what she's talking about.

Turns out this girl is my daughter (I understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when I didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. After turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. She called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. Apparently my wife told her that I wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

Honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman I loved could be so fucking heartless. So for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when I was home.

I tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that I did not say any of that. We organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night I blew up at her. Honestly, I've NEVER yelled at anyone as long as I can remember, but I couldn't hold it in.

My manager named a few and I said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.

Then I jokingly said, 'And nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...

My co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. She raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. It was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.

I guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.

>Edit: hey guys I'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in DM but it would sure be easier if I could just answer them once. I'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, I really don't want to say where I am and my attorneys name. All the laws I found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

So thank you to everyone who responded. And I guess thank you to everyone in the DMs who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, I want to sleep in my own house. Just to allay the fears of the other nice DM's, I did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. Also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

I took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on Monday night. I also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. I called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

He was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the DA actually pursuing this were slim to none. He did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, I could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. He said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


So basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as I type this) but I just heard (Wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. Basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. In fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. The people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. They also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all I know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people I've ever encountered). The can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). So with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

So our complaint to animal control from last Thursday is still on the books. The lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. Our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. The criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

I am left freezing cold in my apartment - As I pay more than 4X the monthly hydro bill of my neighbor,"In June of this year I moved into a one bedroom apartment in Ontario, Canada. My hydro bills were exceptionally high since moving in (averaging $300-$400 CAD per month). *I am a student - and cannot afford these ridiculously high prices!*

* I am extremely cautious about using electricity because of these high bills, so I rarely use the stove, and I only use lights when necessary. In the summer I had an air conditioner plugged in, and i would unplug it when leaving the house. 
* In the fall month when I did not have any heater or air-conditioner on for the entire month of October and was away from the house for over a week, my hydro bill was still $320. 
* This winter I have a small infrared heater plugged in at the very minimal setting of 15°C in the living room. I have closed the doors to the bedroom and bathroom and sleep on the couch beside the heater, as temperatures are getting to be extreme. I turn the heater off when i leave the house for extended periods of time. I do not use the heating provided in the building because baseboard heating would be absurdly expensive. 

&#x200B;

I had made a few complaints to my landlord (whom i have a number of other problems with and currently have a work order issued for them for other unrelated issues in the unit). I have also called my hydro provider and they told me that my unit has had a long history of high electricity charges and all the past tenants have called complaining about it. At this point I just thought that it might just be normal in the area and that I should give up.

&#x200B;

The other day as I was leaving my unit I ran into my neighbor right across from me. He asked my how I was doing... and how my heating was (since it was so cold outside). Of course I broke out complaining about how high my bills were and how cold I am all the time.

&#x200B;

**He looked at me surprised. He told me his bills have always been around $40-70. He let me step into his house, it was so warm! The guy had a heater set so high, all the doors were open and now I am extremely confused.** 

**He let me take a photo of his last hydro bill (the one where it was fall and I paid $320).**

[**Table I made comparing my neighbors October bill to mine**](https://imgur.com/a/hGDRF74)

&#x200B;

After finding out about my neighbors bill I am convinced that something suspicious is going on. There are only 4 apartment units in the building as we are on top of a restaurant. The third neighbor has also mentioned that their bill never exceeds $80, the fourth I have not spoken to extensively on the matter.

&#x200B;

I called Hydro again and they told me they could have an inspector come and shut off the hydro to the unit to see if anyone else is connected to my hydro - such as the restaurant.

&#x200B;

I am feeling a bit helpless and would like to know if there is anything further that I should do. And if I do discover that my hydro is being bypassed, will I be able to get my money back for all these months (adding up to well over $1000 of extra payments)?

&#x200B;

If the inspector finds that nothing else is connected to me - what other possible explanation could there be?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help!

&#x200B;

\****EDIT***!

\- Wow, thank you everyone who has contributed in helping me to solve this mystery! Comments are locked and I've been receiving a number of helpful messages - even electricians willing to come by and check things out!

&#x200B;

\- Basically everyone has agreed that my monthly bill makes NO sense what so ever and that there MUST be an external factor at play (something is connected off of my meter) - at this point, it is just a matter of what that factor could be.

&#x200B;

\- Some people have suggested it is the downstairs restaurant, my neighboring units, the hallway lights/security cameras. Others have suggested it may be that hydro is not accurately reading the meter or the wiring is not properly set up. I have no access to the meter itself to run any of the  tests that you guys have suggested - So I unfortunately will need to rely on the landlord for that.

&#x200B;

\- Some of you have suggested that I look on my online account for usage since I do not have access to a meter- However, others have said that in my area data is not fed directly into the Hydro company in real time - and that looking online may not give me the answers I need.  I am still trying to access my online account to see what's going on - I tried to make an account and it says that my meter number and account number do not match up? Even though I used the numbers from the bill. So I still need to wait until tomorrow to sort that out. 

&#x200B;

\- When the inspector comes by I assume he will uncover the underlying cause- I should be getting a call tomorrow  (2018-11-26) to figure out when the inspector comes.

&#x200B;

\- Since a lot of you have shown interest in what is to come - I will make an update post as soon as the mystery is solved!

&#x200B;

\- If for whatever reason I don't get a reduced bill - some of you have suggested I apply for a government assistance program to help pay the bill  [https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca](https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca/)  (I hope it does not come to that though).",legaladvice

What happened to my brain damage settlement?,"When I was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car I was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head. There was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. My left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. My heart ended up stopping for a while and I was revived. I went through brain surgery, PT, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

I hate to bring this up at all but I know I was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. Im grateful to be alive and I don't want to be a money grubber, but I feel that was rightfully mine or at least I have a right to know the details. My parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet I'm about to be 23 and whenever I bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

Again I really hate to do this but I'm not a money grubber. Ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. It's just I want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money I don't know came from. I'm not saying I'd ask for it back, for all I know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but I still have a right to know. How do I do that without help from my parents?

Edit: This happened in Missouri, STL.
(5/5) thanks for the legal advice and Ive been able to use case net to find my old case. Unfortunately it looks like it was dispositioned by both parties for an out of court settlement? But I do distinctly remember being awarded a settlement. Specifically when I was called into a corporate looking building to testify in front of alot of suits. I'll try and look into it by calling the courthouse and then lawyer. 

But im also surprised by the mass of hate mail in my inbox. Some even depicting me to be a future serial killer headcase. Despite my head injury I'm fully able to lead a perfectly normal UN-serial killer life. Thank you.",legaladvice

TIFU by trying to play my dad's didgeridoo.,"So my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in Australia 10+ years ago. My parents wanted to go out for a walk but I decided I'd eaten too much cheese and couldn't be arsed. While they were out the internet went down so I was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when I spotted the didg. I thought to myself in all these years I've never actually tried to play it (it's more of a decoration and I barely take it in when I see it) and maybe it's time. I pick it up and put it to my lips. I felt like I knew what I was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. I take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. I splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. At first I thought it was saliva and ignored it as I had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. It felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. I glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. The second I clock what's happened I feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. I have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. I run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. I urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. I don't think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

TL;DR - thought I could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.

TIFU by not going to the hospital when I knew something was wrong with me,"As usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. I'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident I was 29 years old. First, a little back story...

Sunday, April 2, 2017 started like any other Sunday for me. I woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. Number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. I drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. I drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. I was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

As I watched the video I felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. Having never had a migraine before, I assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though I was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. They finished the oil and as they did, I texted my girlfriend to let her know that I had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

I got back to her house, popped a couple Ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. I woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. I decided I would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning I would be good to go to work.

I woke up Monday morning still feeling like shit and decided I was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. My girlfriend tried her best to convince me that I needed to go to the ER but I told her I just needed more rest and would be fine. She reluctantly let me try to rest as much as I could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. The only relief I could find was taking pain killers, which I'm not a big fan of, and napping.

I woke up Tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" Against my protest, she dragged me to the ER...and saved my life.

I went in to the ER and told them my symptoms, also telling them that I have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. They sent me to do a CT scan of my head, without the contrast because I wouldn't let them tap an IV on my arm. The CT scan was performed and I was brought back to the room to await the results. As I sat there I caught the Dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""It was at this point I knew....something was fucked up!"" (Dave Chappelle voice)

The Dr. came flying into the room and said, ""Hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. I need to tap an IV on you right now, do another CT scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to Stanford ASAP!""

My life stopped. ""A stroke? I'm 29? How could I have had a stroke?"" I couldn't comprehend what was happening but I looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. I got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (Side note: I live in California but grew up in New Jersey which is where all my family still resides) I quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. I asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

What happened next is a whirlwind. They tapped an IV, did a CT scan then I was transported by ambulance to Stanford ICU. I was greeted by the entire Neurology department, both residents and students alike. The first woman I met said she, ""couldn't believe I was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" She told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

As I laid in ICU they tapped an A-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more IV's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. They had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and I wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. They were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

My parents flew in from Jersey by the next day and I was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (Wednesday). If you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. I've had 3. They lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are NOT asleep. They then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. Let me repeat, YOU ARE AWAKE FOR THIS!

The first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. The blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. I was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and I was allowed to leave the hospital by Friday morning. I used up all my FMLA leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

But wait...there's MORE!!!

6 weeks later I had to go back to Stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. This time they found the culprit. I had what is known as an Arterioveneous Fistula burst inside my brain. It's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. To my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which I did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke I went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. I was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the BEST neurosurgeons in the world. A 3rd angiogram was performed while I was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

I awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain I have ever been in. While I was asleep, two more IV's had been put into my arm, an A-line had been put in my wrist again, and I had a C-line, which is an IV in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. The fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. They could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

The surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me I would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. The next day after the surgery I realized that I had double vision so bad that I couldn't see with both my eyes open. It was either one or the other. I had to patch my eye until I could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. My surgery was on a Wednesday and by Friday I was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

Fast forward, to October 2, 2017.

My vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, I was finally ready to return to work. I was so excited my first day back, even though I wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. Around 11:30 AM I took my lunch and finished reading my book I had been reading. At 12:30 PM I returned to work and about 10 minutes later I decided I had to use the bathroom. I left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. As I walked back, I looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

I could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what I describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. I got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. I started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. I think I tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in April) for help but I don't remember because I blacked out. Next thing I remember was a foreman standing over me asking if I was alright and all I could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

I was delirious, I had smashed my face on the concrete when I fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. My supervisor took me to the ER where they did CT scans, blood work, EKG and chest x-rays. My white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

I did a follow up with my PCP (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to Stanford Neurology to talk with them. And so I have...and this is where I am today...

I was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The issue, as I've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. Due to the amount of time I allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. Had I gone to the ER right when it happened, things may be different today.

What this means for me now is I'll likely lose my Class A license and my career of doing physical work is over. Thank God the company I work for is so large that they can move me to another position where I won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment I feel. Working construction has been my all time favorite. I'm a blue collar guy and I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. I've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. My days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is DONE. It sucks. I'm not happy about it, but I don't let it change my outlook on life.

I refuse to give up on life. I can get through anything and I WILL get through this. I'm out of work until January 8, 2018 at which point I will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as I did before.

I tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. Please, I'm begging you! If you ever feel like something is wrong with you...DO NOT HESITATE! GO TO THE HOSPITAL! Don't be like me, Mr. Toughguy, thinking you can get through it. You know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

I thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. May God bless your life and your health

Naturally, this did not happen today...
Tl;dr is at the bottom.

About a week ago, I was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. We had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. So we picked up lunch and took it to my husband's work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.

We got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. Then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). Our kids loved it!

As we were leaving, I saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out ""hey, nice butt babe!""

Then it happened, my 3 year old yelled ""nice butt daddy!"" Which quickly turned into ""nice butt mama.""

I tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. I thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.

I was wrong.

Now, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;

""Nice butt papa"" (what he calls our elderly neighbor)

""Nice butt mama""

""Nice butt baby"" (his little brother)

I don't think we will be leaving the house today...

TL;DR I set a bad example for my child and now he is telling everyone that they have a nice butt.",tifu

First things first, just wow. I can't thank you all enough for the support through the kind comments and messages. I wish I could reply to all of them, but there are just too many. 

I'll answer some common questions I received towards the end of the post, but I'll first start with where we left off. 

After a long dreadful night full of surprises, I woke up the next morning questioning everything. I called bullshit on the test and immediately called Sarah. She picks up telling me she's already booked an appointment with a Genetic counselor. Good, we're both on the same page.  

The next day, we meet with the genetic counselor specifying in patients who take tests with commercial companies. TLDR of what she said was, while the Ancestry reports can be interpreted with a degree of skepticism, DNA matches are determined directly through the raw DNA data, meaning the connection is either there or it isn't. We asked if there was a possibility that we contaminated each other's samples. She said that our samples would have been flagged by the system (apparently that's easy to spot). Even if our 'contaminated' samples magically made it through the system, we would have been shown to be sharing completely identical segments, while 23andme showed we only share half identical segments. 

It was basically confirmed by a specialist at this point and the same feeling of dread I had the other night began to set in again. My friend called an hour later, telling Sarah and I to upload our raw data to a 3rd party dna site online, as extra confirmation. We did just that, and surprise surprise, we're shown as being half-siblings.

Sarah and I spent the rest of the day calling both of our parents and explaining everything. We all came to the conclusion of Sarah and I taking a weekend trip back home, to see how this all started. This idea came to me the same night when the whole ordeal began. 

Ever since that night, Sarah and I, understandably, haven't been the same. I've been trying to mentally cope with my emotions. The logic part of me is telling me ""Incest bad, not right, break up"" while emotionally, I still love Sarah. I'm having this constant battle in my head, and I'm sure Sarah is too. All of this was especially apparent when Friday rolled around. We both packed our bags and hopped into my car. During our ENTIRE drive up North towards home, not a single fucking word from the both of us. 5 hours later, we finally made it to Sarah's house (the agreed meeting destination). Right before we exit the car, my brain decides to short-circuit. I grab Sarah's hand and lean into kiss her. She stops me, looks me in the eyes, and after brief pause while teary-eyed says ""No matter what the outcome of all this will be, I'll be leaving having gained a brother."" That shit hit me HARD. We both hug each other and start crying. For the first time in nearly a week, I felt some kind of relief while simultaneously thinking ""WTF is going on"". Sarah and I both being the emotional meat bags we are, stop hugging and head inside before one of us mentally breaks down (again). 

2 hours later my parents arrive, and we all sit down and formally meet for the first time. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention how this is the first time both my parents and I are meeting Sarah's family? Imagine how fucking awkward that shit is. I'll spare you all the cringeful details of all of us trying to make the whole situation a 'normal conversation'. 

Both of our mother's brought the sperm donor IDs. For those of you who don't know what that is, when a woman has received a sperm donor sample from a cryo-bank, it comes with a ID that is unique to that specific donor. Our mother's compare the IDs and... they're a match. Sarah and I were conceived from the same donor (which we had already guessed to be the case).

The rest of the night was spent discussing what to do going on. As much as I still had feelings for her, Sarah and I came to the conclusion of breaking up. We decided to go to a bi-weekly counseling therapist, to help us get past all this crap and transition into a sibling relationship. 

We spent the rest of our weekend catching up with our families and headed back to uni on Monday. 

As of now, 12 days later, Sarah and I are going to therapy together and we've maintained a friendly relationship, still keeping in touch throughout the week. Mentally, we're both much better but still have a long way to go. It's to early to tell, but I have hope for the future.

Q&A:

Q: When were you both conceived?

A: We were both conceived a month apart, and born 5 weeks apart.


Q: Do you guys look alike?

A: No, not really. The only thing we 'have in common' are our somewhat similar noses. 


Q: What were your ancestry results?

A: Idk why this was a really common question I got through pm, but [here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am85w9/my_results/)


Q: What town are you both from?

A: No


Q: Why do you both care? You should stay together.

A: There's no way that's happening in this society, nor do I want it to happen. We'd have to deal with social and even legal problems (depending on the state). Also, we'd run the risk of conceiving a genetically unhealthy child if we chose to have kids. 


Q: Were you two able to find your biological father?

A: Sarah and I didn't match closely (in terms of 1st cousins and up) with anyone else on 23andme, and as of now, we no longer have a desire to find our bio-father. The genetic counselor mentioned we should keep an eye out for any future half-siblings taking the test.

TLDR: Confirmed incest with specialist, went back home with ex-gf/half-sister, moms confirmed the same sperm sample. Sarah and I have maintained a 'sibling-like' relationship and are currently in therapy.

Tonight as we were playing Scrabble, I had the option to play the word ""miscarry"" to win the game. From what I could tell, there were no other words I could've played that would have resulted in me winning.

Sadly, a few months she had a miscarriage. It is still a sensitive topic. I chose to play the word, and she was super upset and hurt since I had the option to play the word. She is currently not speaking to me cause I failed to immediately apologize. 

I think in the context of our relationship, she is overreacting. AITA here??

Edit 1: I have apologized profusely, and did so pretty quickly after (just not AS I was playing the tiles). Regardless, looks like the consensus is pretty clear.. thankfully she's a very forgiving woman.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by not taking off my Apple Watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.,"To begin, I'm a female BDSM practitioner. I enjoy it, and I won't apologize. (Edit: That came out harsh. I'm Sorry)

My husband often cuffs and whips me, and on Wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. He put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my Apple Watch. I didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

So we get into it, and he's spanking me and I'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. Hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly I hear from my watch ""Ma'am, I hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. We are sending someone to you. Hold tight."" 

""Did you call 911???"" My husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

So I tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name [She said my name here]? And I say yes... And she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. Im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

I said okay thank you, and I hung up.

""The police are coming.""

Shit. I'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. Within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. We put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

I calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. I didn't mention the spanking.

Apparently my husband did. Another police officer comes in and asks about our BDSM contract. ""He told you about our contract?""

""He felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show State of Mind.""

I go get our contract and showed it to the officers. After a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the Apple Watch if we're going to do that again.

TL;DR TIFU by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy BDSM session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

Edit: iWatch doesn't exist. <3

Edit: this post is not Deja Vu. Yes. I posted it 2 days ago, and mods took it down, asking me to repost it today. The literally hundreds of people asking about if they saw this before need to read this edit. They took it down because this happened on Wednesday, and according to the rules of the subreddit, sexual content is not allowed except for on weekend, so they asked me to repost it today.

TIFU by forgetting my weed butter in the fridge while my parents staying in my flat,"It all happened this morning.

I´m a student  in Cologne, Germany. My parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat. Yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. My dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. Next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. She woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. I couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. So my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some Wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). After a few minutes I started eating too. I took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. I had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. We made way to much of it so I kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. Yeah.. so I took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the Wurstbrot. I was shocked and felt like frozen. I didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on. My mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. I asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. So I started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. My mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. For her its a real, hard drug.My dads reaction was pretty chill. He started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. An hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. He started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to Amsterdam. I am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! Cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.As soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. She is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought I would never do drugs. My dad told me she would calm down soon. They drove home a few hours ago.I think I never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. Its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!

TLDR: My mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. My dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.

EDIT: So my mom called me today. She apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. She told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. She has absolutely no relationship to it. She said that she is proud of me and that I should be carefully with smoking weed.   
Thanks for all the likes, comments and awards! Didn't expect that to happen. I try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed.",tifu

I was filmed against my consent at a party. (UPDATE),"[Last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

History: Myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. In a private villa where expected things to be private. A pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. I asked if we have legal options against the person.

We went to the police. Myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. They didn't. They said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

It sucked. I didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone I know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

BUT this didn't end there. This perv didn't stop. He tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. They got him and handed him over to the police. So he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. They took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

He's now locked up. Our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

It took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

AITA for essentially siding with my family instead of my wife over their precautions for our incoming newphew?,"Throwaway cause reasons.

Backstory: my wife and I have two kids (9F, 4M). My wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an ""oops"" baby. She had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. No major complications or anything like that. 

On the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my SIL, and utilize IVF in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then I would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. My wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my SIL. She would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my SIL and she would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.

So last night my wife received a Facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my SIL that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. My wife lost it. She started saying how completely insane my SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. 

While I said that I agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, I can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF again and my SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. My entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. We would just need to get our records. I also said I can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so I can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, I sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.

Well she took this as me siding with them over her. She's been angry with me ever since. AITA?

(Also, please don't reply with ""YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee DurRR"". I don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)

Edit title: Nephew :/

Edit 2: While my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough I think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). We are pretty close. We all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. They watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. There's always been full trust between us. And I think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. I don't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?

Edit 3: Holy cow, this blew up since last I checked. First of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments... 1) No, SIL has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). Once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. And there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. I feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) It is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my SIL had. It was more the fact that my SIL rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) I probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... But I didn't really ""take a side"", at least I wouldn't consider it that. It's not like I said, ""Well hun, they are right and you are wrong"". It was more the fact that I wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think I was taking their side (I think?). So take that for what it's worth. 5) I appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... I feel like that's what I tried to do here. Maybe I didn't handle it to perfection and I agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe I'll send an update if anyone is interested.

Edit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that I actually have to address this... But no, I was not implying that just because the baby is IVF or their ""one shot"" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. Not quite sure how some folks deduced that. I was merely saying that due to those circumstances I could more easily empathize with my SIL's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by peeing all over my first kiss and immediately legging it,"Not today, about 9 years ago. This story is one that stills keeps me awake at night begging for death.

**BACKSTORY**

I was 15, just an awkward high schooler from the suburbs of Melbourne. I wasn't popular by any means, but I had a few good mates and while none of us had a girlfriend, we were always full of bullshit stories about our sexual conquests. ""Oh, she's from another school you don't know her"", ""It was on holiday"", ""And then her friend joined in"", etc. Between us we must have fucked half the female population of Australia before hitting 16. But in reality all of us probably would have killed each other if it meant a shot at ditching the V plates.

Anyway, as the school year's finishing up and everyone's gearing up for Summer, there's talk about some of the popular kids heading out of town on a bit of a camping trip, out on this king-of-the-jocks types cousins farm. Everyone wanted in. A big piss up away from adults filled with the hottest girls from our year? Come on. If us boys could score an invite we'd finally be able to prove to each other just how much game we had.

I wasn't so naive as to actually bother asking for an invite. There was no chance of us getting a look in, we simply did not have that kind of status. But then, on the first day of the summer break, one of the guys hits me up with a text; ""we're in, pack your shit."" Fortunately for us, his much cooler sister from the year below ours had been immediately invited, and through the age old art of sibling blackmail, he'd wrestled the details out of her. It wasn't an invite per se, but we knew where to go and I doubt we rated high enough to even bother asking to leave.

Due to the nature of the impending debauchery, we had absolutely no interest in our parents catching on to the vibe of the trip and decided to get ourselves there. An hour and a half on the train out of town, a bus ride and about a thirty minute walk later we arrive at the campsite. It wasn't really a farm, it was just this massive property that made money as a sort of backup scout camp most of the year, but the owner was letting us have it for the weekend while it was empty.

We shouldn't have worried about not getting an invite, it seemed like half the year level had rocked up. Looking back I honestly have no idea how a group of 14-16 year olds got their hands on as much alcohol as they did but this thing was **stocked**. We were on some *Project X* shit, a whole bunch of sex crazy teenagers out in the sticks drinking themselves stupid. This was my first experience properly drinking, and despite my apparent long list of sexual conquests, my first time really hanging out with girls.



**THE PISSENING**

One of the great things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down social barriers and make you realise that most people are actually pretty cool once they drop the act. One of the terrible things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down urinal barriers and make you realise that no matter how recently you took a piss, you're gonna be busting for another in no time.

For example, late into the evening, I found myself sitting on a log, alone with a girl I'd never have had to balls to speak to before. A classic popular high school girl, way out of my league. But here we were, her downing vodka from the bottle, me sinking tinnies (of sweet, sugary, girly cider).

Things get a little blurry, but I remember getting increasingly closer and closer until we were making out. We were pretty awkwardly positioned on this log, and in an attempt to disguise my own overly excited log I was sort of leaning forward with my arm tucked into my stomach. My elbow was pushing up hard against my bladder. I suddenly became aware of a desperate need to pee, but I wasn't gonna be a fucking idiot by ending this action to get up and go empty the tank. I needed to be stoic. I could pee when I'm dead.

My unwelcome rock hard guest was at this point making a pretty good go of trying to break free from my pants, and this girl could tell. To my teenage delight, rather than retracting in horror she didn't seem to mind and decided to work with it. Unzip. Pull free. Spit in the hand. She knew what she was doing. But the unrelenting excitement that should have been my first handjob became sheer panic as I felt the flood gates reaching breaking point. Within milliseconds, the thought left my brain and travelled south.

Before the words ""oh shit stop"" could leave my mouth I became a human Super Soaker, releasing a veritable Niagara falls skyward into the small space between us. By the time she'd pulled away in drunken horror, my liquid fury was all over both of us. Her face was contorted into a mixture of confusion and rage, and before either one of us says anything I'm on my feet running for the hills, attempting to tuck my still flowing hose away. She's yelling after me, ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"", as people look over at the chaos.

After hiding away in my tent for a short time, king-of-the-jocks less than politely told me that it was time for me to leave and to take my guys with me. They were not impressed. I called my dad to come and pick us up at two in the morning. He was not impressed. As for the girl? The reputation that followed me around school for the following three years makes me think that she was, in fact, not impressed. 

**Tl;dr** Things were getting a little wild post my first make out sesh with a hot girl, but after foolishly ignoring my bladder liquid gold rained down on the both of us and I ran like the wind. Got myself and my mates kicked out of the party of the year, and had my dad drive an hour and a half out at 2am to pick us up.

Edit: Thanks for my first ever (non liquid) gold!

Edit 2: To all those asking about my ability to take a piss while standing to attention, I dunno what to tell you. Is it a super power? Am I broken? We may never know. But I can safely say that I don't partake often due to urine related ptsd.

**Follow up:** Thanks for all the kind words, I'm glad this harrowing moment of adolescence made you laugh. I can't reply to all the comments but to those asking what happened to the girl, I don't think we ever spoke again but still saw each other in classes and stuff, just forever avoiding eye contact. As for my group of mates, it didn't take them too long to forgive me, and it eventually just became one of those story's that is brought up at every possible opportunity.

My (24f) co-worker (50f) blamed me for my miscarriage but is now frustrated I won't talk to her,"Exactly what the title says. My coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because I was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( I took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why I'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but I'm coming and going 'as I please'.


Me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that I had a miscarriage. Her response? 'I told you you were pregnant! Why the hell are you here? You need to be home! This is why you had the miscarriage! You don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. What is wrong with you? You are being so stupid! You don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. Come on, really. Who do you think you're telling this to? I'm a woman! I have gone through things like this! Don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. Honestly, take care of yourself. '


And then with that she announced she was going on break and I sobbed in the bathroom. I pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. Then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but I've moved desks. I'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. Today she tried to send me a birthday gift and I refused. She is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. She also tried to coordinate breaks with me. I, of course, insisted that I break at a different time. 

This is making her frustrated and I am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why I no longer want to engage socially with her. I am completely amicable to her professionally otherwise. How do I explain to her I don't want to be friends with her anymore? Is there a way I can do it without causing her to 'explode'?

TLDR: worker got upset for getting yelled for being late to work, tried to come up to me and asked me why I didn't get in trouble, I explained that I miscarried my pregnancy and she blamed me for overworking myself and causing the miscarriage and that I shouldn't be surprised if I can't get pregnant again. Now, after not acknowledging me for a couple of weeks she came to my desk with a bday gift acting like nothing ever happened and is upset I didn't accept the gift or want to have lunch together

Update: First, thanks for the support. I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Yes, we are getting through it and doing okay. 


Second, she ended up submitting a false report saying I interrupted her work day and withheld important information. It is false. I have witnesses, I was never alone with her, she had no details on what was held nor did she have any proof and when asked to clarify, she couldn't think of anything. I will update the rest tomorrow as now that she put a complaint on me (and it is very plainly false) it's gotten a lot crazier.",relationship_advice

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here's how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He's definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

"TIFU by meeting a girl on Tinder to, ""Netflix and Chill""","Yes, this actually happened today, see Imgur link. Also, sorry for this being long, see tl;dr below.

I matched with a girl on Tinder today. The profile was ambiguous, just a picture of her laying down on her belly, no bio. I usually start with a creative message derived from the pictures or bio. [I decided to just message her, ""I don't have much to go off from your profile. What does come to mind is that you have a nice looking butt"" She responds, ""Wanna touch my butt in perosn""](https://imgur.com/a/x6cAs3V) You can read the rest of the conversation from that Imgur link. Bottom line is, we decided to meet at my apartment and that I would give her $40 for some weed.

This felt like a whole new level of trashy for me. So far in life, I have only had sex with four people, and I make a serious attempt to date them. I asked my friends what I should do, they said it did not seem too sketch. I was going to say no, until I thought to myself, *""Hey dude, when you are an old man, you will regret not having casual sex with a stranger more than not knowing what could have been.""*

I end up giving her my number and she calls me. There were a few things over the phone that gave me a bad feeling. First, she sounded *way* too casual over the phone. It felt like I was scheduling an appointment with a receptionist. Second, she thought that we were doing this at her place. I asked her if she had roommates, and she responded yes. I told her that it made more sense to do this at my place since I live alone. She ends up hanging up. I am thinking, *""Alright, whatever this all seemed too good to be true anyways.""* She calls back 3 minutes later saying that she lost cell phone reception for a minute. This was the final item to make me feel uneasy. In hindsight she was obviously lying. The amount of time between calls was far too long for her to have just lost connection.

She agreed to do this at my place. I insisted that we get coffee first so I can make sure I am not bringing a wacko into my apartment. She agreed to that and I am feeling more comfortable now. She just asks for a ride, which was not a problem for me.

I leave to pick her up and get $40 for the bud. Up to this point, I was feeling really nervous about going through with this. Then, while I am actually going through with it, all those thoughts disappeared. I am just thinking to myself, *""Tonight is going to be fun! I am about to get a little high with a cute girl, play some Mario Kart with her, 'watch Netflix', get my dick wet, and maybe even... cuddle?""*

Little did I know, I am about to get majorly bamboozled. The address she gave me was not listed. I call her, she says just to meet her at the Rite Aid on the corner. This is when I should have known to back out. However, at this point, I am dead set on eating pussy. I meet her at the Rite Aid parking lot. She actually looks like her profile and all the nerves are gone again. She said we could expect her dealer to show up any minute. She gets the call 2 minutes later. I am thinking to myself, *""What kind of drug dealer is this prompt?""* but me being a gullible idiot, I give her my $40 anyways.

Then she meets some dude on the corner and they walk off together, not to be seen again. I immediately realize that I have been played. She texts me, ""Ur beat sorry"" and that was that.

Was I mad? No, not at all. The situation could have been far worse. It could have been more money. She could have been an undercover cop. She could have been lying about her age. I could have been beat up by her boyfriend. I could have gotten an STD. The list goes on folks.

Right now, I feel three things. I feel great shame, this is not the guy I am. I am just lonely and would have appreciated some sexual comfort. I also feel really bad for her. She must be in a tight spot to have gone through with that. I am sure that she needs my $40 more than I do. Finally, I feel really unlucky, as yesterday was my cake day. If this could have happened just one day earlier, my post would have been gilded *for sure*.

WIBTA If I kick my boyfriend out of my house over chicken.,"I love my boyfriend to death, but we have reached an impasse. I moved into my current house last year after I got a dog, specifically because I wanted her to have a huge backyard to roam around in. I bought her doggy door, and she loved it A few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. He eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. That was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. So then the chickens had monitored outside time. Then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. He keeps her locked in her cage all day when I'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. She can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. He's even started scolding me even when I let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if I'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.

&#x200B;

It's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. He doesn't even pay rent on my house. He refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. When I remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. When I suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.

&#x200B;

At this point I think the only thing I can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens. I know he lives in an apartment, but at this point, that's his problem. WIBTA if I asked him to move out?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Okay, wow, I got way more responses then I ever dreamed of. I've been trying to read through them all. I feel like despite most saying I would N be TA. I think I agree with the people saying that kicking him out is too extreme. My birthday is next week, I think I'm going to ask if we could build some sort of containment for the chickens for it. Also, yes I know I am a human doormat. Been my whole life, I'm working through it in therapy.",AmItheAsshole

LPT: Be mindful of poorer friends when suggesting splitting the bill equally in a restaurant. Some people will choose cheaper options because they're on a budget,"I don't earn a lot of money and get major anxiety if anyone in my friendship group suggests going to a restaurant. Last week, I drank tap water and ordered cheap food (I'm veggie so my meals are usually cheaper anyway, but I did fancy a few beers) because I knew I only had a certain amount of money in my bank, while my friends ordered whatever they wanted, including multiple alcoholic drinks, spending nearly double what I was spending. When the bill came, nobody noticed my discomfort (I tried dropping hints!) and I ended up having to split the bill equally. To them it was probably a few quid, no biggie, (""it all balances out eventually""), but it absolutely ruined my evening as my card was declined in front of everyone

EDIT: I should have said, my close friends know that I'm skint (I talk about it openly), just maybe didn't realise how dire the situation was at that moment. But when it's a large group with lots of friends and their partners who you don't know very well it can be humiliating to draw attention to it in front of a table of people. I know *technically* it solves the problem to announce to everyone that you'll only be paying for what you personally consumed and no more, but it's nicer for someone to notice: ""XX didn't have drinks or a dessert, shall we all just pay for what we had?""",LifeProTips

My faith in humanity isn't restored when I see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. Call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. Disabled people and bullied people aren't your charity case.,"You see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, ""There are still good people in this world. She was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen."" or ""Star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate"". Sure it seems sweet at first but when I think about it all I can see is someone doing something ""nice"" for their own personal gain. When these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? Who gets the interviews and good press? Why, the people who did the ""good deed"" of course. Most of the time it seems like they don't give a damn about the person who they did something ""nice"" for, instead it's about ""Look what WE did! WE are so nice! WE are so good hearted!"" It's all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it's almost never about the person it should be about. It's not sweet and heartwarming, it's almost sort of heartbreaking because I've seen instances where people will do ""nice things"" for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. It was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. If you want to do something nice do it when nobody's looking and don't accept any congratulations for your good deed.

ETA: like i said in a reply to a commenter, Sure its a ""nice thing to do"" and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it's a nice gesture all around, BUT disabled people aren't mindless angel pets. They have brains and lots of them don't like to feel pitied or patronized. Especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. I'm not saying ""Don't ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives"" I am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. Also if you're gonna do something nice for someone make sure you're being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. Don't be nice one day and then cruel the next. I know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that's not my main issue here. The motive isn't the issue either, it's the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. Instead of mistreating someone, doing one ""nice"" thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. My issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. I really don't give that much of a shit about ""prom queen"" or shit like that anyway, I'm using it as an example. I'm almost 20 years old and when I was younger I never ran for those positions anyhow. Another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. Instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. That way he won't feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. Make him feel like he's not a helpless invalid.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by going blind and posting in r/pics,"TIFU by going blind and posting in r/pics 

A friendly Redditor [u/kevindavebob] suggested I post on TIFU so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). This is certainly a TIFU and it all just happened so I'm still feeling pretty terrible about it.

I have a rare disease called Usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. One of the ways I cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever I can to create visual memories before I go blind. I went to Iceland to try to see the northern lights. I can't even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. I didn't know if it would be too late for me to see them. 

I really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for Usher syndrome. Only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, I certainly can't capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. I was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. The photo has been linked so many times that I didn't spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).

With my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, I posted in r/pics. I chatted with a few kind Redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about Usher syndrome. Then I went to sleep….

Well, all hell broke loose.

My post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. I woke up to THOUSANDS of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me I don't have my disease, Redditors telling me they're happy I'm going blind if it is true, that I should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones I won't write here).

I wish the mods took my post down while I was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite Reddit telling me I was a fraud. It then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where I got even more hate. I didn't say it was my picture, but I didn't credit the photographer. I SERIOUSLY fucked up.

I can't even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. Living with Usher syndrome is NOT easy. There is no cure and it's terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. My vision especially. I want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for Usher syndrome to discover a cure. Not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. 

I was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, I didn't make the effort to credit the photographer the way I should have. I fucked up Reddit. 

I am getting so much hate now, even outside of Reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. I'm sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for Usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. We have too much negativity in this world and it's got to stop at some point. 

Thank you to everyone who was understanding and realized I made a mistake. Thank you Luke Stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. I'm sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. Your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.

From the bottom of my heart, I am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.

I really did fuck up, though. 


TLDR; I tried to raise awareness for Usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, Luke Stackpoole. My post made it to the front page and Reddit now hates me.

Fiancée stuck in Saudi Arabia,"Hello. I'm not sure if this is American-only legal advice sub reddit but since I know nowhere else to post this, then here goes.

She's from the Philippines and I'm from Iraq. She works as a nurse there and have wanted to leave for a year now, but the employer won't give her an exit visa, and he keeps extending her stay there. They told us last year that they'll let her go back on March. And now they are saying it's extended till August.

I'm not sure what to do. I tried talking to the manager and the accountant, but it was useless. I want to talk to the employer directly but I'm not sure what to say. I'm afraid I'll make it worse.


Edit : thank you for your responses. She can't physically go to the Philippines embassy 1. Because she's a woman and she can't go alone and 2. Because it's in another city

But Ill tell her to contact them via phone. I'm not sure how much help that would be.

The reason for not giving her the permission so she can have her visa is, from what they told us, they don't have enough nurses and they need her, and because they paid alot of money to her residencey so they want her to ""work it's worth""

TIFU- By not knowing about sunblock expiration dates,"I applied SPF 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. I was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

I pretty much had no idea that I had a problem until I scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. I considered for a split second that I had a burn but like an idiot, I rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

The blisters formed by the next day and I started reading the can to see if I missed something about applying it. I found the customer service number and called it. Before talking to anyone, I heard a recording tell me that the FDA doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. This bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

I had no clue. 

I went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

It was easily one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. Trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. I soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


This was preventable- Sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions.

EDIT- I want to clear up: I'm naturally, very pale person, I was at high altitude while on and in the water. I do not blame anyone but myself for this. Whether expired or I stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. I should have been careful with making sure the things I use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
I agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, I just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
This isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

I'm not planning to sue anyone although I appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
I just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! Be safe! Skin cancer is a real danger.

My two cents and deep concern about this sub.,"Hey all. Me (M28) and my girlfriend (F23) have been long time lurkers on this sub. We have a happy and fulfilling relationship with trust, love, and passion. We have been through our ups and downs, but our relationship is incredible. 

We were reading a post today about a woman who said she found suspicious messages when going through her husbands Facebook. Also in her story she said that their two toddlers were taking up most of the free time and their marriage was hitting a rough spot, like many people struggle with the same situation.

Fast forward to the comments. This is where my concern starts. MISERY LOVES COMPANY. PERIOD. The amount of cutting, negative, ""DIVORCE HIM AND MOVE ON, GOHRL HE LYIN"" comments were unbelievable, and the same goes for almost every top post on this sub...

All I'm saying is be careful, y'all. Especially the younger people who come here for advice. Relationships take work, relationships are hard sometimes, and relationships take compromise. I hope that these folks understand that they're probably taking that cutting ""advice"" from middle aged, three time divorced cat ladies with strange colored hair, or dudes who are manipulative and have never had a successful relationships. Who's got time for that?

Mods, remove this post if I'm breaking any rules. But maybe its a good idea to put some sort of flair on username so people can be a bit more selective about where said advice is coming from. For example ""marriage counseling works"" or ""three times divorced cat lady""

Just my two cents. Sorry about the rant.

"UPDATE: Un-permitted contractor next door did $5,000+ of damage to my home, contractor and homeowner won't pay or provide insurance information","Hi r/legaladvice. Just wanted to provide a ""thank you"" for all of the responses and an update on the situation detailed in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atin99/unpermitted_contractor_next_door_did_5000_of/). Basically, I'm a homeowner in Philadelphia, PA, and a contractor working on my neighbor's house caused a leak that led to a lot of mold and water damage that needs to be repaired, and the contractor and homeowner have ghosted.

&#x200B;

Since so many people suggested we file a claim with our homeowner's insurance, I gave that a shot. However, according to the adjuster I spoke to about our claim, our policy apparently has an exclusion for ""faulty workmanship"". Even though it's completely insane, I was told that our insurance company would not cover the damage or provide any legal assistance because the damage was caused by someone doing work on the house next door. The adjuster told me this is a very common clause in insurance policies. Basically, all insurance companies are completely manned by psychopaths and capitalism is an endless nightmare that will surely swallow us all.

&#x200B;

So now it looks like I'm back to square one. The police have suggested that I try to find information about the contractor and homeowner through the Licensing and Inspection Department to pursue legal action, but previous attempts at that came up with basically zilch aside from a suggestion to hire a lawyer. So I guess I'll try and find a lawyer that will take this case, although my previous attempts to reach out to lawyers about this issue have not been promising at all.

&#x200B;

Going forward, are there any additional avenues I should pursue? My insurance company (Farmer's by the way. If you're thinking of going with them I might suggest drinking poison instead) is completely worthless. The two lawyers I've spoken to seem to have absolutely no interest in taking up a case, one of them specifically advised against hiring a lawyer because of the relatively low cost of the damage, the amount we'd owe in legal fees, and the fact that cases like this are rarely paid out even when they're successful.

AITA for dancing well at a wedding?,"Background: My sister and I have never gotten along. I don't know why, I wish I did so I could fix it but so it goes. I had invited her to come country dancing with me every time I was home, but she never wanted to go.

My date for the wedding was my swing dance partner. We tore up the floor all night long. Any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. We were having a blast which was great because I really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom). My dance partner asked my sister if she wanted to dance at least three times, she declined, and danced quite a few times with the maid of honor who doesn't swing dance, but can sure follow a lead and killed it!

A few members of my family have told me that my dancing at the wedding was inappropriate and I should have toned it down. They have even gone so far as to tell me that I hired a professional dancer to be my date (he isn't... I met him Jr year of college when we started dancing weekly together at a bar)

So my question is, am I the asshole for dancing like I know how to dance or should I have dialed it back a but for the wedding?

Edit: Just so it's not hidden in the comments because it's been the center of why most think I'm the asshole, we were doing aerials, not every song, but they were there.

Update to caught my (27M) girlfriend (24F) masturbating and she started crying,"Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bt4yar/caught_my_girlfriend_24f_masturbating_and_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Damn I got a ton of great advice on my post, thanks guys. Reading your comments made me realize that I'm probably a dumbass and should have thought about it more. She didn't have any trauma but her family was pretty religious and conservative growing up which I relate to, my parents were the same way and they never talked about sex or anything. But it was different in my house, they knew or assumed I would jerk off, they said little things sometimes and acted like it was completely normal. I got her before she fell asleep and asked her about it. She told me that they never mentioned masturbation or sex (we had our own ... interesting problems with that too) as if it didn't even exist but she knew it was bad and she couldn't ask about it or anything. 

It was good, we had a long talk about it like a discussion, we were just talking. No judgment, it was nice, I missed her. Basically she had only started doing it when she was 19 and she liked it but always felt guilty afterwards because she felt disgusting. She tried to stop and it was hard and she saw it as a big personal struggle but she eventually ""quit"" around probably a year later and hadn't done it for a long time. So when we met, she was masturbation free and wasn't lying all this time when she said she didn't do it. 

And then when she walked in on me, she started thinking about it and just started doing it again sometimes because it was fun and she still felt guilty so when I saw her, she felt embarrassed. She admitted that her teasing me and mentioning for weeks was her projecting and trying to make herself feel better in some way. I told her it was completely fine and normal and her private business to do what she wants, no fap or pro fap. Obviously I didn't change her deep rooted views so quickly. I tried telling her that I knew she felt gross but my view of her didn't change at all and I still love her the same and she liked that and gave me a hug. So that's that. She didn't cry again but she did talk to me with her head under the comforter. I know a couple comments told me not to do this but my brain screwed up and I said that it was so hot and I wanna watch her. She felt embarrassed and told me not to hold my breath but maybe one day. We're good now. Had breakfast together and she was fine and back to normal. 

Thanks for all the help. I knew I wanted to bring it up but all the pointers and lines really helped. We talked for a while and opened up an interesting discussion, it was good. 

Some people mentioned that she may have been thinking about someone else, had someone hidden under the covers or our sex isn't good. That's definitely not it lol. And just wanted to say that the comments calling her a hypocritical bitch are really fucking weird. I did not make that post thinking ""wow my BITCH girlfriend has double standards, I should have continued to tease her, it's what she deserved, she made jokes on me for WEEKS, how fucking dare she, I'm gonna get revenge"". I love her, she's my girlfriend, not my enemy. I can take a couple harmless jokes about choking the chicken, it's not that serious. Some of you guys have a concerning lack of empathy.

There was this tramp.,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and Mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...

he reached the board.

He climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""

The captain outrageously asked why.

The tramp said

As far as LinkedIn go, it's a less-detailed version of the master document I keep, as far as work experience goes, but I go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on LinkedIn than I do on paper.

Modified Post

Throwaway account. Indian here.

Background

Mine was an arranged marriage. Met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. Got married 2 years back. We are both from Bihar. Both educated. Living in a metro city currently. We got along just fine.

My wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. We were having sex for just its sake. Slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. No issues there. I always suspected something was off with her. One day something happened after which she got very emotional. I consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. Started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(I didnt ask how many times). Her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. She just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. She said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). She didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

After 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . Her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. All these things stopped after fixing of marriage. She said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . I wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. Think about family honour. What would relatives think if it got out.. It happened to me , not you. I dont want it to come out. Past is past... all emotional storm.

This all happened 1.5 years back. From then I made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. Always with me. We get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

Now present problem :

We had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. But I don't want my baby to go even near that man. She is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. Okay fine. Nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. But just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. I cant let that man even near her. Not now, not ever. I dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, I would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. Just the thought of him touching my innocent child, I cant handle it. I dont know what Im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? What should I do now ?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**

The unequivocal suggestion I got from here was that I should not let her go . I called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. They understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that I can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). So I have to come up with a different solution. And that was of confrontation. I sat down my MIL, and my wife and told both of them that I don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. First she tried to act aloof, but I maintained my strictness and told I don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to YOUR daughter, and I WILL NOT LET HIM DO IT TO MY DAUGHTER. Period. Get it through your head. After I made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, I won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. I again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. There was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. You could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... Nobody could fake that.

I went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. That evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my MIL had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. So I made my demands :

1. I only got leave for 1 week only, so I would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and I would return. Not a day more. She would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. I would get return tickets beforehand.
2. She would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time
3. She would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my FIL, or I would publically make a scene, I won't care who is saying what. I would take my daughter from him and leave. Period.

She was reluctant for the 3rd point, but I was adamant. She finally agreed. Next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and I was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama).

For my wife part, after my MIL left, I told her that Im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. It's a coping mechanism. (Didn't tell her I posted it online, or used the words like PTSD). She got defensive again. Someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. Was worried about it too. Told her she need therapy. Now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. I don't know, maybe she was hormonal. For 2 days she was pissed. And was definitely not ready to talk about it.

Well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. I think here I did something of a fuck up. After normal checkups, I told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. I was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. I was sitting outside thinking I had fucked up the whole situation. But when I was called inside, my initial instincts were right. The doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). She referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. Situation with my wife is tense now. She has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. We are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. I guess my MIL will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. Now I'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown.

We are leaving this weekend, hope I don't have to face any more drama there. Will update if anything happens.

TIFU by being too good at my job,"So this has happened over the last month and half coming to a head yesterday.

&#x200B;

I started a new job, admin, about a month and a half ago. I do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. It's a full time gig, and it might take me HALF of the day to do all my duties. I don't know who had this job last, but they fucked around A LOT. I try to fuck around and I still get things done SUPER fast. This has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because I run out of things to do, and I have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.

&#x200B;

Btw, I am not the kind of person where I enjoy getting paid to do nothing. Sure, it's nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday: I ask my supervisor if there was anything I could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. She asks me how I feel about getting my hours cut. Not just by a few hours. She's thinking me being there 25 HOURS PER WEEK! That's significant.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story: don't do your best because you will get punished for it.

&#x200B;

tl:dr I did my job too well and got my hours cut for it

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you to everyone on the ""real world"" advice. It does suck, but that's the way it goes, I suppose. My boss called me into his office to talk about the situation. He firstly apologized for suggesting hours being cut before they had a game plan. He made it very clear that he and the company appreciates my work ethic and initiative and that they DO NOT want to lose me as an employee. Apparently, when they hired me on there was originally going to be more work duties for me, but for some reason out of his control, that didn't happen. They are going to merge me into another area so I can fulfill a normal working week, not have hours cut, and most importantly keep my pay.  ",tifu
TIFU BY GETTING IN MY EX GIRLFRIENDS NEW BOYFRIENDS CAR,"So this actually happened about a week and a half ago. Some pre knowledge.

I texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. I was like ""alright sounds good brother see you in a bit"".

I got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, ""ummm you're not my girlfriend,"" quickly I looked up and realized ""oh god I am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. I started to unbuckle and get out. I opened the door and heard a thunk. Now I'm thinking to myself ""oh god I just hit the door against the curb but when I looked up it turns out I actually hit my ex with the door.

TIFU by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.,"I'm in my third year of University taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. To start the semester I ended up missing the first week of school because I was on a last minute trip with my friends. It was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since I technically couldn't afford to go.

Anyway, I came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. On both those days I have classes all day until 2pm so I usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. So my first tuesday home I ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. So as part of my degree I have to take microeconomics which all I knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. When I get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so I just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

This goes on for 3.5 weeks. I came to class. Took notes. Then did the weekly assignments. On the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is Febuary 1st. So the class before the exam, January 30th, I decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. Now I was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was ALL theory based while the class was heavy math based. I understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. I explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*Explains above about material*
Prof: ""What do you mean theory? All the assignments are filled with math. Are you using launchpad?""
Me: ""No the assignments are online. Like the website we bought the textbook from. Whats lauchpad?""
Prof: ""Pardon? I don't have a textbook for this course.""
Me: ""It literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*Shows syllabus*
Prof: ""Wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
Me: ""What do you mean...? This is ECON 202 right?""
*Prof starts laughing*
Prof: ""Haha this is ECON 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. This is a new one, I've never experienced this before.""
Me: ""Well this is awkward. I better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

I then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. I caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. Even showed him my ECON 301 notes to prove I couldn't make this shit up. He just laughed and said the same thing ""This is a new one for me."" Turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. Same with the midterms. They were relevant because it was obviously a level above what I was supposed to be doing and the only thing I got wrong was the building code. They were both classroom 112, just different buildings. So basically I just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. Wish me luck tomorrow!

Tldr; I was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until I finally realized. Then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. Crazy coicidences all around.

Edit: Well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""You made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". The exam is in a couple hours and I will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. Ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but I had fun and went to Tiesto's birthday in Vegas amongst other kool stuff. Life goes on.

2. I was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and I had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). So I do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. He did everything on the board and there were online notes but I figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. I highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. It's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. I've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so I'm sure it will turn out fine. It'll be a funny story at grad when I get my ring.

Thanks for all the support too. :) Making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

Edit 2: Just got back from the exam.. I didn't crush it but there is no way I didn't pass. It was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. The prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""I usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm I will take the average to make up that first exam."" So all in all I survived and live to fight another day.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. I will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. In the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""Literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. But somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - CZ

There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun...,"The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


Curious, Attila did as he asked.


Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.


""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

AITA for wanting my daughter's boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?,"I'm the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I've been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there's one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.

After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide ""The Rules"" like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

But I doubt she loves him. We've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. I've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, ""I know you wouldn't dare."" I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

I'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **Maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. It's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

You'll also be amazed how many times writing something out instructionally can lead you to think ""wait, why do we do it like that?!"" - identifying opportunities for improvement.

Edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. For some extra help / elucidation:

-	I found this very helpful when I was starting my career. The biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out ""on paper"" to better see where things need to change, where I didn't know all I could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	I am indeed now a director. Our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. It's those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; I can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. As a manager, it's a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. I'm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it's because they've found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	Most importantly, where I'm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they've been forced to ""work themselves out of a job"" then they can sue for constructive dismissal. I know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it's not a common motif. As such, I do agree that if you're in a country like India, China, USA, where some of these protections and freedoms aren't so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. In others, like Germany, UK, most of Scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

But yes, as with anything - this has been an experience I've personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation.

Aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why I have missing fingers?,"I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

I'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

Anyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.

Within about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

Anyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.

Update: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity.

"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",Jokes
I (31M) am sterile. Fiancé (27F) miraculously got pregnant. Baby looks nothing like me. How do I address this?,"We had been trying to have a baby for a few years. Eventually we found out I was sterile. We accepted it and decided to hold off on trying so hard and said that we would figure out what I do in the future. Although we weren't trying, we were continuing to have sex obviously. One day she missed her period and we found out he was pregnant. I was so happy and I thought it was amazing. We joked about how as soon as we stopped trying she ends up pregnant. The doctor said that it was a miracle baby. 

The night that the baby was born I couldn't be happier. I was just happy to finally have a baby and so excited to take her home. After a few days of taking care of her, I couldn't help but notice that she was extremely pale. For reference, I am black and she is white. I figure she would eventually darken a little and I didn't want to overthink it. 

Then our friends came over and while the girls were inside we were outback drinking. They all mentioned that they didn't want to worry me or to cause drama but asked if I ever thought my fiancé would cheat on me. I thought I was very weird and then I knew exactly where they were going with it. I said no and we talked about our concerns with the babies skin tone. However I still tried to brush it off thinking that the baby would get darker after a while. 

Now the baby is 5 months and I can't help but question if she's mine everyday. She has very fine hair. No kinks or curls, just bone straight hair. I know she's a baby but I have been around plenty of babies who still have natural curls. She is also still very pale. The thing that's been bothering me the most is that everyday she looks more and more Asian in the eyes. I don't mean to offend anyone at all but her eyes are just very stretched, they look nothing like mine. 

Is it wrong for me to be questioning my fiancé when this would have never crossed my mind before? Am I just being paranoid? How do I go about addressing this? Do I even say anything? My biggest fear is that the baby is somehow mine and she will be extremely hurt that I accused her of sleeping with someone else. I just don't know what to do. Please help me.

Well, it's been about three weeks since my post and my breakup. And it took almost that full time to let it sink in what I've really done. I self wallowed for some time and attempted to guilt trip her and get my siblings to talk to her for me. What a mistake that was. She called and ripped me a new one worse than you guys did. She told me that she was thrilled we're not together and that I'm manipulative and ""disgusting."" That left me really shocked and I had to review my behavior over the time we had been together. I think over my life I always had an idea that with enough perseverance anyone's mind can be changed. I don't know where I got this from. I guess I thought it was a sign of being a strong person. Like taking what you want from life even when the chances are slim. It sounds stupid because it is. I reread my post just now and cringed the whole way through. Even the language I used showed that she was right and I am manipulative. She's a human being and I didn't treat her with respect. I played with our relationship to get her to change her mind about something very important to her. I deserve what happened. I also have realized that our views on the relationship were a little different. She had never brought up marriage or anything while it had crossed my mind almost daily because I really was so enamored. So I probably looked insane going on about having three children. It sounds so stupid to me now. Among the things she said on the phone, one was that she found my lack of respect for her body and choices appalling. I wasn't asking her to be forgiven, but I wanted to express how much her and her son meant to me. And as most dumped people tend to do, I couldn't even give a shit about what I was bitching about in the first place. I miss going to the park with her and her son. Those days were nice and calm and I didn't appreciate them. I let some fictional children and my bad habits ruin something good. I have a lot of self reflecting to do, and while I'm still sad, I know now that her dumping me was really for the best. Thanks guys for being honest.

AITA for 'promoting religion at work'?,"I'm a man with a Hindu background working in the UK - that is to say I'm not very religious but my family are and if they're doing something related I don't mind joining in. It was a Diwali this past weekend which is a pretty major festival in the Hindu religion. 

I had a lot of Indian sweets left over, and so I decided to bring 2 unopened boxes and leave them in the break room. At the end of our morning briefing, I stood up and said 'Hey, it was Diwali yesterday and so i brought in these sweets. Help yourself and happy Diwali!'. 

What was meant to be a nice gesture to ingratiate myself (I only started a fortnight ago) has left me seething after a meeting with HR. Apparently, referencing Diwali was akin to promoting a religion and therefore inappropriate at work. Apparently I'd also given out Hindu sweets (this i find ridiculous as they are just Indian sweets with no religious connotations).

To me, it's no different from saying happy Christmas which I know this company has no issue with, as evidenced by their Christmas promotional video I watched in preparation for my interview. 

To be clear I know I'm not TA for brining in sweets, my question is to do with the promoting religion bit. I'm pretty sure I did no such thing, but it's possible I'm being blinded by my own involvement in the issue.",AmItheAsshole

"[Super Awesome Update] Sat down on my friend's MacBook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.","I never thought this would turn out the way it did and I really felt like I learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.

I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

If it weren't for you guys I would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

I feel good for following all the advice here.

No one should feel bad for catching a ball at a baseball game and not giving it to a nearby child.,"I'm even okay with wrestling it away so long as no one is hurt. (**EDIT: this refers to a simultaneous possession/catch scenario where the kid and i both have our hands on the ball at the same time. I am NOT okay with an adult running over to a kid who already caught it and snatching it away. But if the kid competes with me to catch it, I'm winning that competition and not feeling the least bit bad about it.**)Imagine if you're a baseball fan who's been going to games their whole life and you don't get a chance to catch a ball until you're like 34 or something. You catch one and someone's little kid is nearby and they're either crying or giving you that Oliver Twist ""May I have some more?"" look.

If you want to give the kid the ball, great. If you don't and you keep it, also great. I mean, think of who has more invested, here. The adult likely bought their own ticket, has been a loyal fan of MLB for much longer, understands and appreciates the game at a higher level than the child, will probably take better care of the ball.

But of course the cameras will be on you and everyone will be ready to hate you if you don't give the kid the ball. As a person who wants kids, fuck dem kids. It'll be a good lesson in how unfair life is. So let's weigh pros and cons.

If you give the ball away, people will say you're a swell person online, but you'll be upset because you don't have the ball. 

If you keep the ball, people will shit on you online and likely in the stadium, but then they'll forget AND you still have the ball. Kid will forget by next week. 

The winning option is clear. I'm not even a huge baseball fan but if I should so happen to be at a Cardinal's game one day and I catch a ball, I am keeping it and ignoring every kid near me unless it's my own kid.

**EDIT2: since people keep asking why an adult would want to keep the ball, a Blues player gave me a hockey puck a little while back. It sits on my mantle and is a great conversation piece. The baseball would do the same thing. But also, if I wanted to give the ball to my dog as a toy, that's my prerogative. The happiness of my husky means more to me than the happiness of some random kid. I also have friends who are huge baseball fans with kids who play. One kid I know personally and play chess with is 14 and a very good player and dreams to make it to the MLB. I can also see myself giving it to him. The point is, though, that what i do with it could be anything I want. It's mine.**

AITA for Having Professional Hair and Makeup for a Wedding When the Bride Didn't,"Hi, y'all.

My brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on Sunday. I (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while I was a guest, I wasn't in the bridal party. 

They got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. The dress code on the invitation was ""formal."" For the three weddings I've been to with formal dress codes (and the eight I've been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. That is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. A few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my SIL could hire locally. 

Well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. When her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn't used a professional either, nor had she. 

It was kind of awkward in pictures, but I didn't really see a big deal.

Well, yesterday, I got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to ""upstage her"" and that sort of thing. Quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (FYI, my brother thought I looked pretty and didn't see an issue except ""when did you become a woman?"")

I've tried explaining that it was a miscommunication, but they're having none of it. Was I really a bitch?

AITA for asking my wife to have an abortion,"My wife and I (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. We don't have any kids and don't want kids. We had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

Yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.

I'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.

I just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.

AITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?

Edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I'm going to get snipped ASAP.

Edit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:

* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.
* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).
* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by making my GF watch walruses die.,"Yeah, TIFU (last night) royally.  I was watching the making of  ""Our Planet"" last night and got about 50 mins into it and paused to let my GF in my apartment.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it!  Incredible behind the scene documentation of how the videographers set up shots, traveled to exotic locations, survived in insane climates...ending with an unannounced scene of walruses falling to their deaths from a fucking **80 meter cliff**.

My girlfriend comes in, we start cuddling on the couch, resume the doc, and then really sad music starts playing out of nowhere...  I have never seen this documentary before and everything else leading up to it was wholesome af, so this was a little alarming.  Before you know it, these god damn walruses are tumbling down giant cliffs because WHO THE FUCK KNOWS.  Even the camera crew was like ""WHY ARE THEY CLIMBING SO HIGH?!""  For god's sake, the footage was in super slow motion and we can clearly see these poor animals' skulls and tusks cracking with every tumble with their bodies curling over one another into a dead walrus stock pile.  It was truly awful and heartbreaking to watch.

My GF immediately separates herself from me, tears silently streaming down her face and says ""I'm going to bed""; It all happened so fast.  She was upstairs crying and I'm staring at a screen filled with dead fucking walruses while camermen and biologists continue crying on screen.  Guilt welled up in me because it was my idea to continue watching when she arrived.  It didn't help that she made it clear she is extremely sensitive to any sort of animal death early on in our relationship.

I went upstairs and cuddled up next to her while apologizing.  She understood and wasn't mad at me, although I still felt like a jerk.  Before you know it, we were back to laughing and making jokes after a few minutes, so all was well.  We made a deal to NEVER watch any wild life documentaries together ever again (bless you, Sir David Attenborough).  Funny enough, we made plans to go to the zoo on Saturday earlier in the week.  Avoiding the walrus exhibit at all costs.

EDIT:  Reminder that we were watching the MAKING of the documentary.  A bunch of y'all missed that part in the beginning.

EDIT Part 2: Apparently some believe all zoos are evil and are comparable to animals getting their heads bashed in by a rock.  Interesting.

Edit Part 3: I appreciate all of the love and hilarious comments!  And then there is some of y'all that take this internet thing waaaay too seriously.  Yikes!

***TL;DR***  I accidentally made my girlfriend cry by watching walruses fall from an 80 meter cliff.  We are going to a zoo on Saturday and are avoiding the walrus exhibit.  Sir David Attenborough is a universal treasure.

"Am I [F22] wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiancé [F24] decided to publicly ""joke"" about my relationship issues in front of everyone?","A bit of background: Me and boyfriend (recently ex boyfriend) definitely had our fair share of issues. He really struggled with insecurities and jealousy issues. The idea of me going to the gym alone was one he struggled with. Additionally certain articles of clothing I wore were also an issue for him (he would get extremely upset seeing other men ""check me out""). He ultimately decided to seek therapy for these issues determined to fix them. After long discussion we decided it would be best for both of us to part ways as he tries to work through his own issues. This break up occurred not even 2 weeks ago, and of course still feels very raw to me. 

I regularly confided in my older brother about these issues throughout my relationship (we are very close). It has been apparent he has discussed some of these issues with his finance. I wasn't upset, I understood it was his finance after all. I felt comfortable that these discussions were between the three of us. 

However this was not the case tonight. Everyone came to our house this evening for a BBQ. This included my parents, all my siblings, and friends of my brother and I. I walked in the door in full gym attire as I had just came from the gym. My brother finances looks at me and loudly announces ""WOW you really are single now! Look at you actually being allowed to  go to the gym again! *insert annoying laugh here*"". The room instantly got silent, everyone looked to me with uncomfortable expressions looking for my reaction. I was so shocked it took me a second to process what she just said in front of everyone. My dad quickly realizing how uncomfortable I was, changed the subject and everyone began talking again. 

I was hurt by this so called ""joke"" but for the sake of the night I decided to let it go thinking that would be the end of it. NOPE. Not even thirty minutes later, everyone is gathered around the table getting food buffet style. She looks at my outfit and announces ""Oooh you wore leggings to the gym? Must be nice to finally be able to wear leggings again without (ex's name) telling you what you can and can't wear"" again followed by her fake laughter. I instantly felt my blood boil (from anger and sheer embarrassment). I politely corrected her saying I was always allowed to wear what I like, despite his feelings of insecurities. 

NO ONE in my family knew these details about our relationship. I had no intention of ever telling them. This was extremely personal to me. I excused myself to the restroom and quickly grabbed my car keys and slid out the backdoor. As soon as I started driving, I started bawling my eyes out. I know this may seem dramatic to some, but I was really effected by this. I was so shocked and angry by how another adult could ever think this type of behavior was ok. I received several texts asking where I was, and saying how I made a ""scene"" by leaving the dinner. I only responded to my parents letting them know I needed a bit of space. I also feel extremely hurt for my ex, as some of his friends were in attendance at this dinner. She has no right to publicly air my ex's very personal issues to his friends or to my family. Am I wrong for abruptly leaving the family dinner and creating an apparent ""scene""?

TIFU by accusing my son of having an eating disorder.,"So, I like to think i'm an O.K mom. I don't smother my son or let him get too crazy. He's fifteen so I always knock on the door, not just to be respectful, but because there's some things a mom shouldn't see.

Well, yesterday he left to go to the McDonald's across the street with some friends. I assumed he'd be a couple hours so as far as I knew I was alone. I decided to take advantage by putting on some headphones that wouldn't be inevitably tugged on with a ""Mom, can-"" question following.

I'm doing the dishes, sweeping, trash, etc while Metallica is blasting in my ears. I start gathering laundry/putting it away, and unbeknownst to me my son got home earlier than expected.

I decided to toss his gym clothes I just finished washing on his bed while I was putting away my own clothes as our rooms are right next to each other. I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS HOME. I walk straight in without knocking and I'm horrified.

My 15 y/o son is...shoving a spoon down his throat and gagging over a cereal bowl. What the fuck.

He instantly jumps, slowly turns over to me, and the spoon almost comically drops from his mouth. I set the clothes down and in my confusion/horror sit down next to him.

I asked ""What were you doing?"" and he's extremely nervous and keeps repeating ""it's nothing i wasn't doing anything.""

He's on the wrestling team and it clicked in my head *oh shit he was making himself throw up he must be body conscious how did i not notice he was doing this to himself*. 

I start giving a mom speech about how body dysphoria is extremely common in teens and he shouldn't be afraid to ask for help from a trusted adult, that i'm here for him, he's perfect just the way he is. 

He looks like a deer caught in the headlights and remains adamant he wasn't doing anything. I asked ""Is this something you'd rather talk about with (uncle) or (coach)?"" He's exasperated and tense saying there's nothing to talk about.

Finally I just have to say ""It's pretty obvious what you were doing and I need you to be honest with me or someone else so we can figure this out.""

Him: ""I wasn't trying to throw up!""

Me: ""Then what were you doing?""

Him: ""I needed to know if I have a gag reflex!""

I'm extremely confused at this point and ask why. He blurts, ""I'm gay!"" I'm completely shocked and he has tears in his eyes.

It clicks.

I immediately wish I hadn't done laundry that day and give a quick ""I'm sorry, it's okay, I support you completely, I'll just...leave you to that"" and continue doing chores.

Dinner rolls around and he's refusing to make eye contact but eventually we ease into a conversation about how he's been hiding it for awhile, has a lot of homophobic friends and was ashamed to tell me because ""I'm your only son so you wouldn't have grandkids"". He planned to come out in college. I had no idea he thought I'd react that way and assured him I'd love him no matter what.

Apparently he's also not planning on...doing anything he'd need to practice with a spoon for in the near future...but was just curious and wanted to be ready. I'm relieved but mostly want to forget I ever saw that. At least it brought us closer.


TL;DR walked in on son gagging himself with a spoon. thought it was bulimia. turns out hes just gay.",tifu

The only problem was that I told them all that my graduation was on Sunday because I actually thought it was on Sunday. People booked tickets, and cousins were coming from all over America. 

This morning I wake up at 11:30 and was casually seeing my Instagram stories to see everyone in robes. My official school account also was posting about people graduating today. So I went back to the email they sent a few weeks ago on the graduation dates -- turns out I missed graduation. I'm still lying in bed calculating the magnitude of my stupidity. I don't even know what I'm going to tell everyone in my family who's going to come down to ""see me walk"". I MISSED MY OWN GRADUATION!!

"Assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist","Basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
BUT:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc 
-> fixing the person's problems

If after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

A much needed edit:
- The time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" Programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way
- the free aspect seems to irritate some people who don't want to fund it with their tax, how about funding it with the taxes from rich people/corporations instead?

TIFU by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards,"This actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. In 2016 I started using Tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. I had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. My profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

Fast forward to March of 2017 and I matched with someone. After a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. A couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. This all sounds great. Except for two problems.

The first problem is that I have a beard in all of my photos. And even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. My facial hair is like if someone shaved a Guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. If I grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. Wiry and sparse. It's not good. For six years, I'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. But for some reason, the week before we started talking, I had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. I just wanted to know what it looked like. The answer? Not. Fucking. Good. At this point, I was 27 but still looked young for my age. Shave the beard off and I look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. Really fucking awkward.

So I pulled up to her house and text before I got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" Luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as I expected. All good so far.

I went inside and we end up hanging out all night. She cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. She was blown away by the fact that I'd never seen Labyrinth and demanded we watch it. We ended up watching three movies that night. For Labyrinth, I was about five feet away on the couch. For Young Frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. For the third movie (which I can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. And this is where the second problem comes in. 

After my breakup in 2016 and realizing I'd been battling lifelong depression, I started taking antidepressants. One of the SUPER FUN side effects of SSRIs is that it can be really hard to climax. Like, try as you might, nothin. Dust. Moths. Nothin. Thanks, Big Pharma.

And so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. Two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck I might have a heart attack. Why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""What about this position?"" ""OUCH!"" ""Oh my god, I need a towel. So. Much. Sweat. I can't see."" We were in the basement on a large three piece couch. You know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. Well at one point I tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. A bruised ass. A bent dick. A lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

If this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. Well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. And jesus christ the sweat. So fucking slippery and gross. This wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. This is bog monsters come to life sweat. This is Ace Ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. At one point our chests become suction cupped together. I could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. And the chafing. FUCK. No matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. We both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. My poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. Not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. This was no climactic movie sex scene. This was a John Waters film come to life. 

Well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. It's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. We went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. I'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. We sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (She had just moved back home before finding a new place). So not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now I get to meet her mom for the first time! GREAT! I'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. Somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent Tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. Life is fucking weird.

Well, the reason I am posting this on March 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on March 14th of 2020. Our sex life is FAR better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. I mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

TL;DR I met up with a Tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. Now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




EDIT: Just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! I am still wholly undecided if I will ever show her this post. It's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. We'll see though. And thank you so much for the gold and silver! Did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. And for those asking, I've changed my dosage on my SSRI and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. Talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! And also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. He didn't pan out. Within three months, her mom got hit up by several Tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. Tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

EDIT2: I guess now I probably have to show this to my fiancée to which she will reply, ""I have no idea what any of that means. Good for you, I guess?"" I still love her.

EDIT3: A few of y'all keep asking, ""why in TIFU?"" Well, let me tell ya, if I had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. Even worse than my breakup the year before. Not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? Yeah, that sucked. Just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't SUCK ASSSSS on the whole. I mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk

FINAL EDIT: For real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. I told her about this post when I got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when I read it to her.

TIFU by swiping on lesbians on Tinder for 2 months.,"This has been going on for two months and I just found out today. Throwaway account because many know my real account and I don't feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

So I signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. I set up my account...set my interest in 'women' and started swiping. Now when I signed up for tinder I linked my Facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if I set my gender to woman. I had completely forgot. I'm not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but I was getting barely any matches and couldn't figure out why. Figured the algorithms were just screwing me. Over the course of the two months I would think ""wow short hair must be the new thing"" or ""so many bisexuals on here"" but never really thought anything beyond that. Then this morning I woke up to a new match. She said I looked great, to which I replied thanks, you too! But then she replied with...""how long ago did you transition?"" I thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. That's when it all came together and I realized I've been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

Tldr; My 13 year-old self is an asshole.

TIFU By Hugging My Friend's Sister!,"I feel so embarrassed even typing about this even though this happened like an hour ago. I still can't believe I can be this stupid. Me and my friend had  decided that we would meet at a certain point so that we could go have lunch to a place which was close to that point. He told me that even his sister would come along with him. And I was fine with it.

NOTE: The problem was that I couldn't seem to remember how she looks because I rarely see her as she stays away from the family.

So back to the present, after sometime I hear someone say Hi and I turn back to see who it was. It was my friend's sister who was walking towards me with her arms outstretched. I commit to the hug because if I didn't it would get awkward. So I hug her and it seemed she really wasn't into it. So I step back from her and check what's wrong.

Now I realize I did two mistakes. 1. She wasn't my friend's sister. Because my friend was exactly behind her and with him was a girl. And she was already laughing about it. 2. She actually wanted to hug a person who was behind me and that's why she extended her arms.

After that they were kinda shocked, I couldn't really tell what their emotions were because I just walked away.

After that embarrassment I hugged my friend and ' his sister '. And they mocked me until our lunch got over.

TL;DR : Basically hugged someone else thinking it was my friend's sister.

TIFU by listening to my GF's obviously stupid game.,"So, yesterday my girlfriend and I were playing around, you know as lovers do...naked. Some time in this whole play activity, she asked if I could stick my penis in a bottle.

Now, this was a weird thing to me but I thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so I went ahead and did it. It didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes I know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. She started laughing and I started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. She never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. She knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. I begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. Now my dick was straining and I started to get really worried. Then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.

Long story short, she started crying and finally stopped. The bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts). Since yesterday, peeing still hurts. She thought I wouldn't be stupid enough to proceed with putting my limp dick in a snuggly fitting bottle.

TL;DR I fucked up my dick by putting it in a bottle.

**Edit**: So my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.

If you come back here to check, no I'm not taking it down, I am the one with the sore dick and no one can tell from the story that it is us because we told no one (well I hope you didn't). Sorry, I'm keeping it up. See you at 8.",tifu
AITA for having fun in front of miserable people?,"My husband and I rent a house with his brother and wife. We live in a very expensive city and this is quite a big house with great metro access, so that's what's convenient. We get along fine usually.


My husband and I have a son. He's just turned five. The early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! During this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. There were quite some bad days, but my husband and I got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. Whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


Recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. Sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. So a few days ago, I pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. When we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. It seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. I sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.Then my son and I leave for the movie.


Today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that I didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. I'm kind of shocked that I'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. I feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

AITA?

ETA: For all those asking if I resent my in laws for not helping... I think any parent would like help. But I don't feel entitled to their help when it's my husband's and my decision to have said child. However I am feeling really resentful right now that they feel entitled to my help and the fact that they never helped me definitely makes it worse.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by letting my boyfriend pull out,"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons, even though this story takes place almost 15 years ago. 

I was new to having sexual relations with boys, as previously it was only ever my girlfriends who I explored with sexually before boys. So I didn't have a whole lot to go on as I didn't have regular internet access to view porn or search sexual questions. 

So anyway, my boyfriend and I are getting busy in his basement bedroom. I'm smart enough to be on the pill, and also we had both just gotten tested for STDs before starting to go further in our relationship. Because of these clean tests we decide to bareback the sexy times and he opt to pull out as well, just in case.

He aims and blows his load on my stomach. Except we can't find it to clean it up.  We looked everywhere and could not find his little splat of spunk. Then we hear the front door unlock and open and the sound of his younger siblings and parents. We quickly get dressed, I spray myself with body spray (good old Calgon) and head upstairs to pretend like we didn't just bang. 

I've only met his parents a couple times, and they are pretty easy going, especially as they let us sleep over in the same room. I have an uncommon female name and I'm often misnamed. So she reaches in for a hug and doesn't bother with my name, and then points out that I have a wet spot on my T-shirt. 

I have always had large enough breasts that I cannot see my tummy by just looking down. I have to lift my shirt. Well stupid me forgets the fiasco moments ago and I lift my shirt slightly to investigate this wet spot. Shining in the afternoon sun, is a long snot like string of jizz attached to my shirt from within my belly button.  His mum gives me this look and says I must have dropped my hair product or something and leaves it at that. I think I've gotten away with it. 

After dinner sometime as we are putting away dishes, she takes me aside and hands me a WAD of condoms. Not a word is said, just a handful of condoms. 

Now I occasionally see her walking in the mall and make awkward eye contact with her and she gives a weird smile. I know the only thing she thinks when she sees me is ""bellybutton full of cum""


TLDR: boyfriend pulled out and lost his load somewhere, but don't worry, his mum found it for me.

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him ""Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that"". And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said ""if you love him so much, why don't you suck his dick instead of mine"". I couldn't say anything, I didn't know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

I don't even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive.

Thanks for the help!

She ended up taking me to court. Her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before I even met her, and she married me knowing it). Her lawyer claimed otherwise, that I had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. This was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as I had email communications with her acknowledging my record. She insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. Perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. Her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

She dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

Her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. He was a decent guy. Ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. It's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

"LPT: When resigning from a company, don't tell a single person until your management has acknowled and accepted it.","As a manager who faces employee resignations, in many ways it can open a door to conversation. It's not always about money. Maybe it's an opportunity in another department, maybe it's a change in responsibility and yes, sometimes it's a pay change.

However, the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them you've just given your notice, that opportunity is gone. Management generally doesn't need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that. If half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company, everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior.

Also, accepting a counter offer is NOT the end of the world as many would have you believe. It's entirely situational and sometimes you have to play the game.



EDIT: Wow. Compensation is always a touchy subject. A few things to understand before you continue to assume that I am the world's worst manager.  

1. Someone posted a good summary of how the annual review/raise process works.  We get a bucket of money to spread across a team as we see fit.  It's usually a small bucket.  I also never have the power to walk into HR and say ""Hey, give this guy a 20% raise, he's earned it. Oh, and why not do the same for the rest of my team while you're at it?""  In fact, I have very little control and even a counter is just leverage for any manager to get traction on the subject.  

2. Seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled ""top performer"" is underpaid.  I can assure you that that isn't the case.  Many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands.  Go ahead, tear me apart for this, it's just the truth...

3. Remember employment is a mutual agreement.  Everything is in play.  If you don't like what you do or what you get paid, talk with your feet.  There is nothing wrong with that.  ",LifeProTips

TLDR: My girlfriend was really close with my roommate, I suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

Basically, after I kicked my gf out of our party, I assumed we would all lay low for a few days. I was wrong. The day after the party, my roommate (I decided to call him Chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but I ignored him. Less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing Chet couldn't have been avoided, because while I was a good boyfriend, I study and sleep too much. Ok. She then told me she would be willing to work through this if I was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. I didn't respond to the text.

That night I had a dinner with my parents I couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. I came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. I figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. Wrong. I noticed later when Chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into HIS room.

I haven't seen either of them, I think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. I don't even know how to feel. Honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and I'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",relationship_advice

The thing is, we don't see that much of him. But whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. Like a different girl each week. He occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

Now the three girls I live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  Since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

When we're in the kitchen (when Cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude Cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. They were doing it yesterday so I just chimed in and said ""Are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...I saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

TIFU by joking about AncestryDNA and 23andMe.,"This actually happened over Christmas last year.

My family, including (paternal) my grandparents, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having Christmas dinner. 

My grandfather brought up that he did AncestryDNA (or was it 23and me?). I don't remember the exact one, because I can barely think about it. It's hard just writing this up.

It was really cool to hear what he found. He found mostly Scandinavian spread out over the British isles, particularly Wales. We knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% Persian! Very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. He's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

The only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of King George III. The reason why I question this is King George III is recorded as one of the few Kings who never had a mistress. 

However, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of King George III (we are descended from the woman). He mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

ANYWAY, off topic. I thought it was fascinating, and I love hearing what he's found. I brought up possibly using my Christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. I don't think I was really going to do it, I usually use the money to pay bills.

Silence. And it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. Everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

My sister and I look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. My parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. We look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. I have weird Hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. My sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

I always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. I never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair I have such cool pretty eyes. 

Well, okay.

Dad starts first. Dad (D), Mom (M), Sister (S), and Me.

D: There's a chance 3ar3ara_G0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

Me: Okay, um... 

D: Your mom never had an affair. This isn't some cheating story.

Me: Wha.. (I start to feel very sick).

M: I hoped to never have to tell you this. I was raped. The reason we're not sure is because your dad and I had sex earlier that day.

Me: (I want to die, I start crying). Everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

D: Your grandparents know.

S: Okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

M: No, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

Me: He's still out there?

S: But obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

My dad and mom look at each other.

I felt so sick. I felt... dirty. I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. I couldn't stop shaking. My sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. We probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

Our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

The rest of the vacation was just weird. If it weren't for my nephews, I'm pretty sure I would have just gone home.

Oh my nephews are wonderful.

Well, we came home, and I had to battle with the ""Do I want to know?"" thoughts. I could get a DNA test. But I couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. But it weighed on me too much. I had to know in order to move forward. So I asked my dad if he would submit his DNA with mine. We weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. It was hard asking him to not say anything to her. He should be able to talk to his wife.

So we submitted the test. 

I am my father's daughter. I cried when I got the results. It was a huge weight off my shoulders.

I made a decision not to tell my dad - I wanted to surprise them. I kept saying I hadn't gotten the results back. I did tell my sister though.

I gave them the piece of paper on Mother's Day. I was going to wait until Father's Day, but I couldn't. So I got a blank card. 

Inside I wrote: ""Mom, Open the paper."" She opened it and I had written Happy Mother's Day, and Happy Early Father's Day. 

Lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

Thank God.

EDIT: left out half a sentence, oops. 

It was my uncle on my mother's side. I have met him. My sister and I were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

Family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

My parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. Two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. Incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there I guess was his reason. Plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

My mom didn't go No Contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. Why that long, I have no idea. Those are her reasons. 

She did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. I guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

AITA for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.,"For the last year I've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


About a week ago I went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don't know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I've gone I've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


I'm thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?

Update: Hi guys

I thought I had the golden ticket, I really did. 

I thought I had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


I wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I'll be honest I didn't care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


After I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""I mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


I made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

It was a gift card. 


I had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

I'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

TL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.

Update 2: to everyone saying this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not. I wouldn't be able to eggzagerate something like this.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic,"Throwaway because I'm still embarrassed and I don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

For background, I usually make the bed in the mornings, but I didn't yesterday morning because I was running late.

I went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. I got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. I checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and I just couldn't find her. Her wallet was there so I figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. I started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. I called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. I called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. My father in law told me to track her phone, so I went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. I turn on the find my iPhone sound and start running through the apartment thinking I should call the cops.

I hear the sound coming from our bedroom so I go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell I'm doing. Turns out the small lump that I thought was just a pile of blankets since I didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. She sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

I had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

tl;dr I didn't make the bed yesterday morning and then I thought I was about to end up in an episode of SVU.",tifu
I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.,"Is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? Every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years I was the one who blew up for the first time. 

Long story short, i'm half-Korean/half-white. My mom is Korean. My dad side is white. So we only have my Dad's side here in the US. For years, I watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. They never invite her to things. Me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. To be frank, I don't care how i'm treated. Every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. We repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. My mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. My white Grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

Three times today I watched a family member (Aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should I sit?"". I watched my mom quietly recoil and I couldn't stand to see it again. This aunt does it the most and I finally blew up. I yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. I told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. To stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the US for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. I watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

My Aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. As she was leaving I walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. I said  ""for 30 years I watched my mom give you a gift every year. I watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. I've never seen you treat her with the same"".  She didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

Before I left, I apologized to everyone and explained why I was upset. Everyone was shocked how mad I got. I felt like everyone understood why I was mad.  Prior to this (around thanksgiving) I spoke to some family members about how I was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. Which they have been trying to do more. 

After blowing up, it made things awkward. People trickled out early too. Now my grandma is talking about not doing Christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. I feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. Does anyone have any advice on this? Handling rude family?  Should I do something else? 


[Edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below]

Mom's reaction: On the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. She's always taken the high road it's a very Korean Christian mom approach. My mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older Immigrant/Korean/boomer approach too. It's taught me a valuable skill in life. I don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being Korean/white. After we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. She didn't say anything and asked me if I wanted my favorite Korean dish. 

Where is my dad: He was in the other room. Yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. He's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. We'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. We would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. My dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. Defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. Including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. As soon as I got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (I can't describe it). There wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. I was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. My white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. For years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

Me: Reflecting on this as a whole. I can't believe the response. It shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. After Thanksgiving I started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. I have no relationship with this aunt. I should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. A small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. If she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""F*ck her"".  Please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. I should have tried to speak and I did what I felt was right, I don't regret it.. Grandma's 80th Bday is in two months.  I can't wait for that to be awkward. Someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. Regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. Cheers and have a Happy New Years!

[Update 12/29/18]
I wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how I felt and I didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. I explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. I told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. I told her I wished I had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. I told her I want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. I'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

I called my grandma to let her know I sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. I told her I didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. My grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. I was right for standing up for my mom. Also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""I never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
TLDR: After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my Korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something I've been feeling for years. How do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. Should I do something for blowing up?

Ex is pregnant and I might to have to pay child support... except I'm a lesbian. Help? [North Carolina],"This sounds ridiculous. It *is* ridiculous. 

I'll start off by saying I'm a cis gender female. My ex is also a cis gender female. We separated about two months ago. State law says we can't even begin file for divorce until next July. She texted me today to tell me that she's 6 weeks pregnant. She's due in like June. We will still be married when her baby arrives.

I know from a friend's past experience that the mother's spouse's name automatically goes on the birth certificate here, whether he's actually the father or not, as long as they're still married on paper. My friend had to go through a paternity test to prove the baby wasn't his, and his lawyer said if the baby's real dad didn't step up that he might still be on the hook for child support. Because apparently the state doesn't care who the baby's actual dad is, as long as there's a second party to financially look after the kid. Luckily, in my buddy's case, the baby's father went through the process to be recognized as the real dad so my friend could be removed from the birth certificate. My ex says she doesn't know who the dad is. So basically, I think I'm screwed. 

There is no way in hell this child is mine, but I can't divorce my ex in time to avoid it defaulting to me.. I'm meeting with my lawyer on Tuesday but like, really, this can't happen right? I feel like common sense says it isn't my baby so I shouldn't be responsible but the laws (as I know them) say otherwise. I guess the advice I want is what to realistically expect? Are there other cases like this? Or am I boned and doomed to play mommy #2 to a kid that isn't mine?",legaladvice

I am now back in the US. It wasn't easy and took a long time mostly because my parents had hid all my American documents from me. But I found them, took originals and replaced them with copies. They never noticed.

The office of foreign interests at the Swiss embassy were very helpful although they didn't do anything until I had the documents proving that I'm a US citizen. I was able to exit Iran by going on a vacation with my family to Turkey and I just did not come back with them. The foreign interests office arranged everything so that I could go to the US consulate in Istanbul, they were already in the loop and were aware of my case, I had a quick interview and picked up my travel documents. My brother bought a ticket for me to fly to the US directly from Istanbul. I had a difficult time getting through airport immigration and had to answer questions for over an hour but in the end everything was fine.

Needless to say my parents are very upset with me but they have no control over me anymore. I now need to find a job and see what I can do for going to college. Thank you for the advice.",legaladvice
TIFU by trying to remember what a customer looked like,"The time has come. I've made it. I'm writing this from the break room shaking and humiliated. Not only did this FU happen today, it happened within the last hour. I don't see my therapist again until Friday, so you get to hear about it instead.

I work in a customer-facing position in a small office. Today's just a regular Monday. Talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. At time being, I have three customers sitting in my waiting area.

The most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we'll call her Jan, has been here before. Or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it's my first time meeting her. The name on their account is Hank Junts and I feel like I've met him before. I *know* that I've met him before. I browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me I cannot place his face.

After about ten minutes of idle clicking, I decide to search his name on Google with the name of our city.

>""Beloved Softball Coach Hank Junts passes away in tragic fire."" 

Headline from a local news station.

*Oh my god. Maybe that's why I've never met her before. Maybe he always came in instead of her.*

The article is dated December of last year.

*Jeeze, it probably has been that long since I've seen him, hasn't it. Oh how tragic.* Jan is probably only in her 40s or so. 

I wonder if I should say anything.

But I don't have to say anything. I would credit Satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but Satan never did anything so heinous.

**In tragic news, Hank Junts, softball coach at Smith Middle School, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**

At full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. I cannot catch it. The bird has knocked a vase onto Mrs. Junts' head. The bird has knocked me on my ass. There is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.

*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*

**no no no.**

I frantically scroll trying to find the video player. Fuck. Found it. Pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.

*Oh yeah, that's what he looks like.*

Jan looks up at me. I look up at Jan. The Earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.

No, I'm not that lucky. I stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where I now sit red-faced and horrified. I can hear her on her cell phone. She is crying. I am crying. I fucked up and just ruined my customer's day and have a new addition to the file of Horrible Things To Think About Right As I Fall Asleep.

tldr: Couldn't remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and I played it all of ten feet from his widow.

edit: okay I hate edits but now I understand why people do them. our FAQ of the day - no, my keyboard unfortunately does not have a volume button and I do try to keep my computer on mute. for what it's worth (i.e. not much at this fuckin point), the only reason it wasn't muted was because I was showing someone a coworker a video while we were opening. and yes, I probably shouldn't have done that either. 

there's a lot of love/hate about the bird thing. thank you for the compliments. if you said something mean I hope a real life non-metaphorical bird poops right on your head.

as far as what I'm going to do next. Mrs. Junts is coming back into the office next Monday so I'm planning on talking to her in person then. thankfully I have a some days to practice because tbh, even though logically I know it was an innocent mistake, it still feels awful and it's hard to think about facing her. my coworker said she seemed okay when she left. and yes, I know that it was probably a mistake to run away but if I had any good judgement about any of this I wouldn't have a reason to post here in the first place.

"We spend TOO much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.","I get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and I am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  I don't debate that and I have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. Not only respect, but gratitude.

I appreciate the debate around what's defined as poverty, I think it's a good debate. But even if you only count people who are literally starving, it's still twice as many people and that doesn't invalidate my initial statement. Have a nice day!

TIFU by telling my three year old daughter that I would eat her booty,"Alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

So my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  And more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. Anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""Mommy, get my booty! Get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

Obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. This get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

This brings us to last night. The wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""GET MY BOOTY DADDY!"" To which I reply nonchalantly ""I'm going to eat your booty! Nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

I immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""EAT MY BOOTY DADDY! EAT MY BOOTY"" and takes off running. Dear lord, what have I done?! I try to go into damage control and revert back to Get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

I took her to daycare this morning, I hope she forgot all about it. I'm dreading picking her up.

TL;DR my daughter yells Get my booty to initiate games of tag. With her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face I instead say I'm going to eat your booty! She now yells EAT MY BOOTY to initiate the game instead. 

Edit: A word. Also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

There were lots of requests for an update after pickup. All is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

Thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them.

AITA for refusing to adopt my wife's two kids after discovering who the real father is?,"I am a 35 years old guy, and I was lucky enough to marry my crush (27F) two years ago. We met at work, where she was a receptionist for the big building my company is in. Anyways, she has two daughters, 6 and 7 years old.

When I married my wife, I was a bit iffy at the idea of being a dad so fast and so suddenly to two kids that aren't mine, but I love my wife so much I am willing to sacrifice my man-time and a portion of my salary to take care of the kids.

To be honest, I've had my ups and downs with them (you know, kids) and sometimes I think I'd be happier going back to my ""lone wolf"" life. But I fully know that this is my life now and I try my best to suck it up and do what I signed up for.

Back to the story: I know the kids dad had died only from my wife's words and I've never had reason to doubt that.

It has been two or three months since she started convincing me that I should adopt them as a birthday gift for both of them (their birthday happens in two consecutive days, coincidence). I'd be fine with that, it's just paper for what I would do anyways.

I agreed to that and she said she'd get on with the documents. Well fantastic! I thought. I like not having to do anything. What really got me suspicious is how she changed her behaviour with her phone and laptop. She started putting the phone face down, and she created a totally different user for her laptop she switches to when she's with me.

I thought she was cheating so I did what every scumbag like me would do, I spied on her. Long story short, I come to know by a very reliable source that…. her ex-husband isn't paying alimony anymore as he is in jail with no money to his account. The world crushed on me. First I thought the guy was dead, now I discover he is alive, paying alimony to my wife's bank account while I was financially providing too.

I confronted my wife and she didn't deny any of it. She started crying and she was adamant that she did that only for the kids' well being. She was putting the alimony money he ex was giving her into an account for when the kids will be 18 yo (I have no proof of that). She also said that it was a while since she felt I should adopt them, as they love me and they look up to me. She was firm about stating that nothing happened with her ex husband while she was with me. She said that her ex is ""dead"" for her by all means. She admitted that she lied, but for good purposes - as she was scared that a guy like me would be scared by her reckless past. That's not who she is anymore, as she is focused on family and on us.

Now, I need to find out more about her ex-husband that's for sure. I am also furious with my wife for not trusting me enough to come clean about her past. Meanwhile, will I be an asshole if I refuse to adopt the kids (they have a dad and he's ALIVE!) and if I state that I will retract from them all the financial support in case I decide to get a divorce?

"META At any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.","This seems like a really weird meta post, but I just wanted to warn people that Captain Sparklez, a YouTuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole Trails episode talking about this sub. It's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

It seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. The thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

This isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. Honestly I knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds I know to this day. But it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. Take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

I *am* the asshole, I already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. Sorry, teenagers, but I kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. I wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but I would also be looking at their advice differently if I knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Just be careful everyone. And please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. This doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes.""

Whether it's a short guy or a tall girl, it is physically impossible to change your height.

I think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. What options do I have? (OK)," I'm a high school teacher. I work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. ""Dan,"" my ""across the hall mate"" has  been here 8. His son,""Leo"" has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. Leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. Since Dan was the football coach, Leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. Leo would  often visit his dad's classroom before and after school and I got to  know him as well. Leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

This past summer, Dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. They asked me if I would be a source of support for  Leo while they were away. While Leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so I would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. I also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. The last day I was to be in this role, Leo sent me a VERY  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. I told Leo that  was inappropriate and that I would be telling his father.

I showed Dan the text and he claimed that Leo's phone must've been  ""hacked"" or ""played with"" while Leo was at work. I didn't believe that  explanation, but I accepted it and moved on. The next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from Leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could ""hold on to me"" and ""take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler"" and ""kiss me gently."" I forwarded the texts to Dan and did not  response to Leo.

Dan came to my house the next day and said that Leo was not sending  those texts. He said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. Then, I started getting texts through some ""unknown number""  that were the same in tone and writing. A selfie of Leo nude was also  sent. I called Dan, thinking this might be something happening at Leo's  job or something.

This didn't stop. I was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. As soon as I blocked one, another popped up. I went down to the  store where Leo worked and spoke with the manager. (I taught all of his  children). He told me that Leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker's phone and he had already talked to Dan about it two weeks  ago! So, Dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

I changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. This included my new number. Dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. The next thing I know, I'm getting crazy texts again. I  said something to Dan at work. Dan said Leo was ""harmless"" and I should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more I avoid him, the  more miserable it makes Leo. Dan even said those days that my number  stopped working Leo became very angry and Dan had to give him  medication.

Last night, when I got home from work, my kids told me that Leo had  come by looking for me. I was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. The kids said he arrived in a car, but not Dan's car.  My son guessed it was an Uber. I don't want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

Am I being stalked?  
Am I being unsympathetic to Leo's problems?  
Is it wrong of me to expect Dan to manage his son's problems?  
What do I do next? 

I'm not going anywhere, and I doubt Dan is, so we will be ""across the hall mates"" for another 10 years…

Unattractive people should learn to accept that they're not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.,"""Everybody is beautiful to somebody."" 

""Ugly doesn't exist."" 

""Everybody is equally attractive in their own way."" 

""Looks don't even matter. What's on the inside determines whether you're attractive or not.""

""You're perfect just the way you are."" 


These quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. It's like everyone needs to believe they're attractive or else. God forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

But... why? Is being unattractive THAT bad? Is attractiveness a person's only value to humanity? Are the lies necessary?

Sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. But alas, this is planet earth and life isn't fair. Some people are born with attractive features; some are not. Some are born with blatantly unattractive features. Yes, that's nobody's fault, but that's just the way it is. 

Before you say ""beauty is subjective"", you can't deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. For men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. For women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. Aside from certain fetishists, I've yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

Not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder ""what am I doing wrong?"" when they find that others don't view them how they view themselves.",unpopularopinion

My [21M] tinder girlfriend of 3 months is actually dangerously underage [15F],"location: australia 

Posted this on r/relationships and got advised to put it on here. Some more things: to the best of my knowledge, she would never do anything to hurt me which includes tattling to her parents (from what I know she doesn't have a good relationship with them and they've put her in some hard places before) Or at least I hope not..

I've been looking to settle down recently and met a gorgeous girl on tinder where we hit it off instantly and have been pursuing a relationship for the past 3 months. Yes, this includes the physical side (obviously before i found out her real age). We have discussed age-specific things before, and she has always seemed so well versed in her high school days and uni work that I never even noticed anything was up. The age on her profile is 19, and I never thought to doubt it because she looks about 20 anyway and has the maturity of someone around that age too. She asked me to grab some cash out of her wallet yesterday and I found an old ID with her real birth year on it— 2003. I haven't confronted her on it, and personally have no idea how to even begin. I was falling in love with her and now I feel completely duped. Obviously I haven't pursued any sexual stuff with her after I found out, but I am so heartbroken. I'm not a pedophile but really have no idea how to deal with this! Any advice is appreciated

TIFU by detoxing myself and it nearly cost me my life,"Obligatory this happened 2 weeks ago

&#x200B;

I had been dieseling through a handle of cheap vodka every other day for over a year. I've never been much of a drinker, but several traumatic events had transpired in a very short amount of time, so I began drinking more to help me cope. I would never consider drinking during the day or before work, but it helped me get through the day. Mixed drinks slowly gave way to straight shots of vodka. I would wake up at 7 am, feed the cat and take several shots. This continued well into the evening until I passed out on the couch or my bed. I started working at a local department store and the schedule was perfect as I didn't have to be in till1pm so I could wake up early, take several shots and sleep on the couch till noon then get ready for work; taking a couple of swigs on my way out the door. I'd get home around 10 pm and drink until I passed out.

This past February is when the shakes started, usually near the end of my shift. I'd get home, have a few shots and everything would be fine. What was disturbing was my memory loss. I was repeating stories, unsure of what day is was and I even forgot to pick up my nephew from school. Dusk and Dawn were the worst, it took me a few minutes to figure out if was day or night. I knew something had to change. Two Saturdays ago I bought a handle in the afternoon and it was gone by Sunday evening. I woke up Monday morning feeling awful. I was shaking, queasy and terribly off balance, but I didn't drink. By the afternoon I was feeling better and I figured I would get through this. I went to visit my sister and was having a glass of wine and a cigarette out on her back porch when I began to vomit all over her back deck. It was then that the shakes returned with a vengeance.

I went home and crashed on the couch. I woke up around 5 am and spent 20 minutes dry-heaving in the bathroom. I tried drinking water, but my hands were shaking so bad that it took both of them to steady the glass. I went back to the couch and drifted in and out of sleep for the majority of the morning. Sometime after noon, I went to get my cat some water, but my hand began to convulse uncontrollably. I tried to steady it with my other hand, but I spilled water everywhere; that was the last thing I remembered. I was laying on my stomach on the living room floor when I noticed a Police Officer standing over me. I had no idea where I was or what had happened. I tried to get to my feet but collapsed onto the couch. My coffee table had been completely turned upside down and its contents were strewn all about the room. My mouth was in so much pain and I saw chunks of blood on the floor where I had been laying. The Officer helped me get my shoes and coat on and assisted me out into the hall.

There were 2 more Officers waiting outside and the helped me down the stairs to an ambulance. The paramedics were asking me questions, but I couldn't answer their questions. once in the Emergency Room, the Doctors and Nurses bombarded me with questions that I could barely answer. My main concern was the throbbing inside my mouth. One of the nurses explained to me that I had chewed off part of my tongue as that was one of the effects of having a seizure. I was admitted later in the evening and that was my sister and nephew came to see me. I could tell by the look in her eyes I was in very bad shape.

I was hooked up to several different machines with IV tubes in both arms and a blood pressure cuff that sat snuggly on my left bicep that inflated every 15 minutes; I was on the brink of complete coronary failure. Over the next 3 days and nights I was a prisoner to my bed. There were sensors that would trigger an alarm if my legs went to far over the bed, if I tried to sit up it would set them off as well. If had to pee, they brought me a plastic jug and I had piss in the bed with an audience. Every 30 minutes the blood pressure guff would inflate and take a reading followed by a nurse coming in and injecting medicine into my IVs. The worst part was I couldn't eat and barely drink because of the pain in my tongue. My speech was incomprehensible as my tongue was so swollen. Everyday my sister came to visit and told me she had gone to my apartment to check on my cat and make sure everything was locked up; she even cleaned up the chunks of tongue off the floor.

By Friday afternoon I was stable enough to go home, but with strict limitations. No driving, no strenuous tasks and lots of medication. This past Friday I finally started eating solid food again; after 2 weeks of pureed food it was like heaven to eat a chicken salad sandwich. Everyday I get a little stronger and feel a lot better. I still have trouble with my memory, but I think its good that I don't remember too much about the last year. I spoke to my neighbor; the one who called 911. He told me he had heard me fall and came banging on my door. When I didn't answer he went around to my back door and saw me laying on the floor. He said I looked at him and my face was covered in blood, that was when he called 911. I gave him a hug and he checks in on me daily. My tongue will never heal, but it's a small price to pay to remind me never do that again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR TIFU by attempting to detox, I suffered a seizure and chewed through my tongue. If my neighbor hadn't been home to hear me fall, I would've died.

"AITA for not paying to save ""my"" dog's life after my mom ruined its health?","When I (22F) was 11, the family dog died. I was very sad and repeatedly asked my parents to get a new one. They finally agreed, on the condition that I'd be responsible for it and take care of it. That's how I got Mickey, the cutest Cocker Spaniel and best boy ever.

I did take care of him. I took him for a walk every day. Started spending my own money to buy him food. I was so motivated with the whole dog caring thing, I even read books and magazines on how to properly educate it. They made a big point of feeding it properly and not spoiling it with human food, so I tried to stick to dog food.

But my mom (53F) would still give him ""treats"" which consisted of pretty much anything she was eating, including sweets, chocolate and cookies. Throughout the years I confronted her about it but she'd just brush it off every time. I tried to buy her ""good"" treats, actual dog snacks, that she could feed him, but she continued to feed it junk.

Over the years, Mickey started gaining weight. He refused to eat proper dog food, eating only my mom's junk food. He also grew very attached to her, mostly because she spent all day at home with him and fed him. I was still the one taking him on walks (not once did my mom do it), playing with him at the park, but he seemed to prefer her company to mine. She'd even make snide remarks about how he'd ""chosen her as his mommy"" and ""liked her better"". This only increased my resentment towards my mom.

Fast forward a few years, I had to move away for college. I reluctantly agreed to leave Mickey with my parents. His health started to decline even more. My mom didn't take him out at all, and without me to control her, he grew even more obese. Every time I visited I'd see the poor thing getting worse and just looking sad and it'd break my heart.

This has been going on for four years. Mickey is now eleven years old, half blind and with very limited mobility. Last week, he started vomiting blood. My parents took him to the vet and found it's going to need surgery to survive.

That surgery's going to cost roughly $2000. My mom doesn't have the necessary funds and asked me to cover it. I told her I can't do it. I do have the money, but it's nearly all of my savings which I need for myself. I love Mickey, but I can't justify spending all my money, specially when his health is so poor and he'll probably die from something else soon anyway.

Upon hearing this, my mom accused me of being heartless and ""basically killing the dog"". She said I'm the reason she bought Mickey in the first place, and reminded me of my promise to care for him. I told her she's the reason he's dying, and that she's been poisoning him for years.

Later my dad called, told me I'm being unfair, that even if my mom hasn't cared properly for the dog, it's wrong to let him die ""just to punish her"". The dog's life is more valuable than an ""I told you so"" to my mom. He asked me to reconsider. I still said no, but now I feel really conflicted. So Reddit, AITA?",AmItheAsshole

"UPDATE to ""He's(25) falling out of love and I(25f) don't know what to do"": Why he avoided me.","[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b17a0h/hes25_falling_out_of_love_and_i25f_dont_know_what/)

What happened after I made the post: I wrote him a letter, hinting that this relationship won't work if it continues like this. I also printed the post I had made and the comments I got. I thought maybe it helps if he sees it from a different perspective. I put the letter and what I printed on the bed, together with a photo book of an amazing vacation we had. I then removed the SIM card from my phone, a), because I didn't want to communicate with him until he read what I had left on the bed, and b), because the phone was actually his old one as my actual phone had been sent in to be repaired, and had now arrived at my parents', and that's were I wanted to spend the weekend. Then I picked up all our pets, and left for my home town (I always take them with me when I visit my parents).

Apparently, he came home early from work, only about an hour after I had left, to a deserted apartment. When I put the SIM card back into the repaired phone about 7 hours later, he had left a few messages, saying that he had read what I had written and printed out, thought a lot about all this, he had looked through the photo book, and had a conversation with a friend. That friend is almost twice as old as we are, used to be his drinking buddy and is sort of a father figure for my boyfriend. He said that this friend had gone through the same situation with his wife. Apparently, he had been so stressed out by his job going downhill, he tried to safe it by working longer hours, which sometimes created some tension between his wife and him, so he avoided her by going out for drinks every night, creating a vicious cycle of her being unhappy about not seeing him and him avoiding her even more.

But he had found a solution. He realised that his job shouldn't define his life. He made a list of goals he wants to tick off each week. His marriage has apparently been going very well since then (it's the reason why I said he used to be my boyfriend's drinking buddy!).

My boyfriend said it dawned on him. He's in the same situation. He's putting in as much effort as the CEO who doesn't even appreciate his work. He doesn't want to lose me, I'm the best thing that has ever come to his life. He apparently cried a lot and made his own list of goals he wants to tick off each week. When I came back Sunday night, I found it on our fridge. It has very specific goals about him working less overtime and making up for the lost time by taking time off, spontanously going out only once a week max with his drinking buddies, and spending time with me doing real activities at least twice a week.

Since then, our dynamic has changed entirely. We had sex. We cuddled. We talked. He was there. Now it's only been 6 days since I made the post, but I hope it stays this great between us. I guess the realisations he had could help with him keeping up his new goal habits.

Weirdly, all the talks we had before when I told him I was unhappy because we didn't see each other much probably contributed to him avoiding me even more after already being stressed from work. This ""talk"" was different, because it made him realise that he'd lose me if it continued like this, and because it made him reach out to his friend. Maybe the deserted apartment contributed as well, because it was a little taste into life without me.

TL;DR: I probably owe my boyfriend's friend big time.",relationship_advice

AITA for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?,"My friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (I'm talking two lines or less). I say this not to be a hater, I truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. Neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

Anyway last week I posted a group picture on Instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. Everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. Very platonic. 

Anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. I would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. Also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them.

I pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning IMDb pages. They were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

I think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). At this point, I don't even want to be their friend. However, and probably because I'm an asshole, I don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

My (22F) twin (22F) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. Don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23M) of 8 months.,"This has happened with every single guy I've dated or been interested in. I've only had 3 relationships before my current one with ""John"". My twin sister ""Sarah"" has tried to interfere with all of them. 

Two of my ex's cheated on me with her. The third we broke up for other reasons but Sarah still tried to seduce him. He was a good guy and always had boundaries with her, but that didn't stop her from trying. To the point of sending him nudes multiple times then claiming ""oops wrong person"" when he told her he wasn't interested.

When that didn't work she also tried to break us up by lying to my ex and our mutual friends that I was cheating. My ex didn't believe her but some friends did. So yeah that was fun to deal with...

Then, when we were kids like in middle/high school, if Sarah found out I had a crush she went after the guy herself. I used to tell her those things because well, isn't that what sisters do. She always used it against me. I told her I was working up the courage to ask my crush/ the guy I was ""talking to"" to prom. She then asked him and he said yes. She said he'd just been using me to get to her. Another time a few years before that she announced to everyone in a class we shared that I liked this one boy who got bullied a lot. Kids then started teasing him even more and he hated me. I felt horrible for months, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. She also once told a teacher who's class I was doing bad in that I was into him and willing to do ""favors"" for better grades. That got reported and I had to go through this whole counseling thing before it was finally cleared up. It was extremely embarrassing. My sister just blew it off as a prank.

There's so many other situations like this, she either gets guys who are interested in me to sleep with her or ruins my chances with them by making up bullshit to make me look bad. She's ruined some of my friendships lying about me too (told my best friend in high school I was gossiping meanly about her and went so far as faking text messages.) I don't know if she even actually wants these people for herself. You might think it's obviously jealousy but sometimes I honestly think she just gets a kick out of messing with me.

Anyway I've finally got my life more together after wasting the first couple years of college on being depressed and a gaming addiction. I met my boyfriend ""John"" at a campus organization. I haven't told Sarah, but he ended up meeting my parents by accident today. I don't have much contact with them but they decided to come for a surprise visit... they live over 5 hours away and do this a few times a semester even though I've said I don't like it. But that's for another post. John was in my room with me when they got here. I had no choice but to introduce them (he knows I was holding off on having them meet because I don't have the greatest relationship with them)

Sarah lives at home with my parents while going to college locally. I'm certain they're going to mention meeting my boyfriend. And then cue her insisting on coming with them the next time they surprise-visit me. Also stalking my social medias to try to figure out who he is.

I've tried to explain the issues I have with her to my parents. They think I'm over reacting, they say she just wants to know what's going on in my life. To be involved. Yes that is the problem...her involvement. 

And, not to mention we used to be closer before I lost trust in her to stop doing this shit, so I've seen what her own life is like. She does things my parents have no idea of. She takes party drugs sometimes. This wouldn't be a big deal but she has no idea how to be responsible. She drives people around while drunk and high, my parents think she's with a friend studying on weekends but she's actually clubbing in the city and then crashes with her friends for the night. I'm not sure how many real boyfriends she's had but she's hooked up with a lot of guys the same night she met them. This has meant a few times she was scared of pregnancy. I've had to help her get Plan B. It sometimes feels like she sleeps with nearly any man that smiles at her, and told me she's even had ""sex"" with a few girls while wasted however that's possible... she confides all these things to me, but whenever I need someone to talk to she has no time. Never wants to hear anything unless she can save it as ammo. So I've gradually stopped telling her most things.

If my parents knew all this they might see where I'm coming from, it's not just random that I don't want her meeting my boyfriend. It's not because I want to hurt her or something. The problem is, our parents are really strict and traditional, and they'd probably kick her out if I told them any of that. They don't believe in sex before marriage. My boyfriend is the first person I've had sex with, and I'm afraid my sister could use that against me to them if she finds out.

So what do I do? How can I keep Sarah from finding out about him and doing the same thing she's done with all my past boyfriends? How do I explain it to my parents?

TL;DR: my sister has a pattern of interfering with my relationships. She's gotten guys to cheat on me with her. My parents accidentally met him today and will probably tell her. How do I keep her away from him?",relationship_advice
AITA for filling a few faux Amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?,"This has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. There are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... I have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. The first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a Bluetooth speaker.  Amazon replaced all my packages and I would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so I decided to fill a few packages with Chihuahua shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. I also taped notes that said "" Dear Children, Stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. Some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet.

TIFU by making my wife think I killed myself,"Right off the bat I want to say that I am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. This was not a prank gone wrong, or something I did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. Burner for reasons.

&#x200B;

This happened a couple of weeks ago. I tripped and sprained my ankle. It's been bothering me enough that I've been taking Epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. In addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, I also find it incredibly relaxing. Say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, I enjoy a good soak.

&#x200B;

I also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. It's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...I call them old man spots. They're harmless, and most of the time I don't even notice, BUT every once in a while...I'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. Additionally it takes FOREVERRR to get the bleeding to stop...its not like I can elevate my balls, Let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200B;

Well...on the day in question, I get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. So, I get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. It's not really important how I did it, but I ended up nicking one of those spots. So, after cursing a reasonable amount, I start the lengthy ritual of holding TP against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. Even after the bleeding stops I have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...Well I finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. I put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200B;

 I wasn't asleep but I was really zoned out and relaxed...until I was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. I've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. It scared the shit out of me, and I jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. I shouted ""HONEY? WHAT THE FUCK!""  She didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  It took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""Jesus Christ!"".....I could see what it must look like to her... I had apparently NOT stopped the bleeding as well as I thought I had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200B;

It took me a long time to calm her down, and I don't think that's something you just get over. Hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though I thought I had. Took a bath, zoned out. Wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact I was bleeding into the water and thought that I had killed myself. Sorry honey.

"TIFU by finding out I've been accidentally dating and fucking my half-sister, after taking a 23andme DNA test","(EDIT 2)Proof:(https://i.imgur.com/Z0zm9xi.png)

Throwaway, obviously. I also made the [same post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/af5eex/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) over at r/23andme.

I just found out a few hours ago and my girlfriend and I are currently a mental wreck. 

Quick background

My girlfriend (I'll refer to her as Sarah) and I have been dating for a little over than a year and our relationship has been going very well. We both happen to come from the same town and met each other in college after being introduced by a mutual friend of ours.

Here's where the FU begins to unravel

Last year for Christmas, Sarah decided to come over and stay with me at my apartment for the holidays. I also had decided not to go home for the holidays either. Plus, all my other roommates were back home visiting family, so we had the whole place to ourselves. It was perfect. 

Christmas day rolls around, and Sarah had bought the both of us 23andme DNA kits. The thing is, is that we were both conceived by in-vitro fertilization via sperm donors. Both of our fathers were infertile so our parents had no choice. Deep down, the both of us were hoping to find our biological fathers through the service.

Fast forward less than a month later to today, and both of our results are in. Sarah comes over to spend the weekend and we go through our results together on our laptops. We compare our ancestry and health reports and nothing seems off. I even found out I'm 2% Native American. All was well until we arrived at the ""DNA relatives"" section...

Sarah tightly holds my hand and says ""I hope we both find our fathers"". Then I open mine up....

At the top of my screen, I see Sarah's name.... ""27% DNA shared...half-sister..........""

Sarah starts hysterically laughing and tells me to stop joking. 

I don't react to anything she says, and just stare at my screen in disbelief. 

I then abruptly grab her laptop and open up her ""DNA relatives"" section. We see the same thing. My name at the top... ""27% DNA shared...half-brother"" 

At this moment my brain just completely short-circuits.....

I'VE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH MY HALF-SISTER. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. WTF

My mind starts going a 100mph and I began hyperventilating, going into a state of shock. I can't even remember what Sarah was doing at this time.

It's pretty self-explanatory by now, but for those of you who don't understand how we could be related, it turns out our moms were probably both fertilized by the same sperm sample. What are the fucking odds, right? The fact that we're from the same town certainly increased the odds but still. 
 
6 hours later, just typing this entire post makes my body shiver. There are no words I have to express what my mental state is now. To put it in simple words: I feel traumatized. Part of me still won't stop thinking about how much I love Sarah and then I realize our entire relationship was incest. I honestly feel disgusted standing in my own skin. I've even been contemplating suicide.

Sarah and I haven't talked at all since going into shock. 

Right as I'm finishing up this post, Sarah has grabbed her stuff and left my apartment a few moments ago.

I'm probably not going to respond to any of your comments/questions for now and I honestly want to be left alone in the corner of my room. I really just needed a place to vent all this.

TL;DR: Former gf and I are both sperm donor babies and come from the same town. We take a 23andme DNA test and find out we're each other's half-sibling. Meaning I've been having sex with my sister for over a year. Turns out we both were conceived from the same sperm sample, go figure. 

I do not give permission for my post to be used in the making of any movie, story, book, etc. 

EDIT: My mates just came home and are giving me support. 

EDIT 2: RIP inbox. Thank you all so much for the support. I just logged back in and didn't really expect this post to blow up. Last night was rough. Sarah's friend/roommate called letting me know Sarah was home. As of now, Sarah and I still haven't talked. But after an night of thinking, I believe I've come to terms with what we've discovered. For those of you who still think this is fake (I honestly wish it was), here's a screenshot showing our shared DNA (https://i.imgur.com/Z0zm9xi.png).
I think the best way for Sarah and I to heal is to go back home (our town) and see how this all began with our families. Only then will we be able to accept the reality. I'll post more updates as things develop.  ",tifu

What is your mom's catchphrase?,,AskReddit
"[UPDATE] Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","I am gonna make up some names this time around because referring to people as ""the female seller"" or ""the tenant"" is cumbersome as hell.

After the mess on Wednesday, I met my realtor for dinner and to grab my closing docs. The seller's agent actually wound up stopping by as well (he arranged this with my guy) . He apologized profusely, told us he knows the family and he's confident we'll be able to get things sorted quickly. I didn't get my hopes up but he picked up our tab and bought a round of drinks while he was there, so hey, when life gives you lemons, make a superhuman amount of whiskey? I don't think that's accurate but it was my approach and I stand by it.

Anyway, I wound up speaking with the seller, Anne, yesterday morning, and got the rundown on the situation. It turns out the unwelcome tenant (Bill) is actually her nephew, not her ex's (Charlie). She was absolutely livid with Bill, and promised me the apartment would be vacant ASAP even if she had to physically drag him out herself and pay for movers to take all of his stuff. She also gave me assurances that she'd cover whatever this ordeal has cost. From there, she said she was going to check in with her sister (Diane) who was dealing with Bill as we spoke, and get back to me as soon as she knows something, but again promised that the absolute worst case scenario would be Bill starting to move out by early afternoon.

Maybe half an hour later she calls back and tells me that Diane had rented a truck and Bill was in the process of packing his stuff up. Turns out Bill had recently experienced something pretty fucking awful, and as a result had sort of become preoccupied with seeking approval from adult males. Charlie was at the top of this list; apparently his midlife crisis consisted of buying a Harley and trying to carry himself like a badass, and Bill bought the act hook, like and sinker. And a lot of you guys assumed correctly - Bill cooked up the scheme to basically extort me for a cash for keys deal. From what I was told, Charlie figured a doctor from NYC would just pay out right away to be done with it. For what it's worth, I am not an MD, nor am I from NYC... but you do you, Chuck. Anyway, at this point, Anne threw me a curveball. She and Diane were both at peace with the fact that I was going to pursue this with the police, but asked if I could meet Bill so he could look me in the eye to apologize because she wanted him get an understanding of the fact that his actions hurt a real, live human being. I agreed to it - I was hoping to see if I could get in to check the condition of the place anyway.

So yesterday evening I went up to the apartment and met ""my tenant"" as he was loading up the truck with his stuff. We wound up speaking for a while and... well, I am gonna disappoint some of you here. He seems like a genuinely good kid who got taken advantage of by a legitimate piece of garbage... there were a lot of tears, and innumerable apologies, and I 100% believe that these were based on genuine remorse for what he did, not regret about getting caught. I'll just say it here because I don't think I was being as slick as I'd hoped in dancing around it anyway, but the kid recently lost his father, and I don't see any reason to fuck up his life with a criminal record over a (ridiculously, incredibly) stupid mistake that he was to a great extent manipulated into making anyway. For whatever it's worth, if getting involved in a stupid scam like this was the worst thing that I did at nineteen... yeah let's just say that I was a remarkably stupid and reckless kid. I lucked out and never wound up getting caught in a situation that could have had significant legal consequences, but if I had and I hadn't been given a second chance, I'd be living a very different life right now.

As far as the money goes, Anne and I are going to figure out what's what, and I don't want to explain how because it involves details about her personal life, but the money will technically be coming out of Charlie's pocket anyway. She started by hiring some movers to unload my truck, which is taking place as I type this. Bill left the apartment in shockingly good condition, but I am basing that on what sort of damage nineteen year old me would have passively done to an apartment, so this may be a touch skewed haha. Either way, no damage has been done aside from some very minor cosmetic stuff (a couple of light scuffs from moving furniture and things like that), all of which would become immaterial when I redo the apartment in anticipation of renting it out, so I am not going to concern myself with any of that stuff.

As far as Charlie goes... well, I mentioned in a few comments that My Attorney (who is too majestically vicious for fake names so he just becomes capital-M-My capital-A-Attorney) is a super intense older guy and later found out is a ""retired"" civil litigator who can't sit still long enough to actually retire. Yeah he's out for fucking blood. Turns out Charlie does have himself some assets, and My Attorney is pretty confident that they will become my assets soon enough. I had a brief chat with one of the officers who came by on Wednesday (he's a friend of Diane's, apparently - this everyone knows everyone thing is still very foreign to me), and will be going by the station to issue a statement/file a report/whatever it is you do in this situation. Some of you expressed concerns that he may have fled the country, but the concept of Charlie leaving the county, let alone United States, is very funny to Anne, Diane and Officer Friend-of-Diane. Seems like Charlie is just a dumbshit who thought he could pull a fast one, and will be easy enough to find at one of the local watering holes when it's time for him to be picked up. I absolutely do not believe in throwing around assumptive diagnoses for fun, but I've made an exception in this case and decided that Charlie has full bore antisocial personality disorder because it makes me feel better about things for some reason. 

Anyway I have been typing this piecemeal throughout the afternoon which has essentially been a test of my wife's patience. I'm not dumb enough to incur the wrath of a tiny Puerto Rican woman who has spent the last couple of days stressed out of her mind, so I'm gonna call this a post. Thanks again to everyone on this sub for all of the advice given and sympathies expressed, I'm lucky as hell to have had this end the way it did.

A Tinder experiment with my [28M] girlfriend [27F] of 3 years has gone horribly wrong.,"Hi all. 

&#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and thereabouts, and all was going pretty well. I met her IRL, but before that I was having no success with the Tinder game. She, herself, never used it ever.

&#x200B;

2 weeks ago, she was telling me about some of her friends' horror stories on Tinder, and I laughed with her and added ""Tinder's way worse for guys, though"". She didn't believe me when I told her most guys get 0 matches, and I wouldn't either. So we decided to play (what seemed at the time) a fun game : set up Tinder profiles of each other and see what happened. And the obvious happened: after one week, I had pretty much no matches except bots. On the other hand, she was bombarded with matches and messages, quite a few of them from pretty attractive guys (or at least, what I judge to be attractive guys, a lot of them probably more than me). She admitted I was right and that it was an ""eye opener"". We agreed to shut down our profiles.

  
The problem is, ever since, she's grown slightly more distant and cold, and it's now beginning to be noticeable. Basically less happy to see me, much less in the mood for sex, not as physical or cuddly as before, and more importantly way more monosyllabic in our conversations. etc. I sat her down yesterday to talk about it, and she was evasive. When I asked if the Tinder experiment had anything to do with it, she looked away and just vaguely said ""I don't know, maybe"". 

&#x200B;

I feel like I've played myself here. Is this doomed or is there any way I can save it? 

&#x200B;

TL ; DR: played a Tinder experiment with my girlfriend and now it looks like she's way more distant and cold towards me.

This is his girlfriend...,"Hey guys just wanted to jump in and give my small bit of say. I am his girlfriend and tonight he met with me to tell me how much of a gold digger I am and gave me the link to this Reddit you all have been talking about me on and said ""That's what everyone thinks of you"". I wish I could describe the pain this has caused me. We only partially discussed finances, and we only see each other about twice a week. We hardly go on any dates, the other night we had top ramen and watched Netflix movies in his room and I was very happy. I make my own money, I pay my own tuition out of pocket, going to have a great career and I consider myself very self sufficient. I am very proud of him for being able to finance (not own) a house. I asked if he would keep it if we were together and married and he said ""yes"". I asked if he would rent it out to offset the expenses of another mortgage we could share 50/50 on together and he became very defensive saying I was trying to make money off his childhood home. I never tried to offend him, and only asked bc I saw a marriage as more of a unison type thing. I already said I would get a prenup with him, so I'm also not sure why he is bringing this up. 

In conclusion, there are always two sides of every story. I am not a monster or a gold digger. We go on very cheap dates  every few weeks ($10-$30) and I've thanked him every time he would offer to pay. I have paid for some. I just wanted to give my say in this. We are no longer together as of tonight. I sincerely appreciate everyone who took the time to give an opinion stating that there may be more to the story than he is willing to share. I hope I have a partner who loves me enough to give me the benefit of the doubt, and talk to me in a more positive light. ",relationship_advice

AITA for asking boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip he's taking without me?,"Sadly this is a serious question.

In an exclusive (not open) relationship for 8 months. BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. 

I saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.

Reddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by ""accident."" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. 

AITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?

EDIT: He has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. I don't believe he has an active plan to cheat. I am, however, upset, because to me the act of bringing condoms is an active refusal to close the door on the possibility of intimacy with someone else if the opportunity happens to arise.",AmItheAsshole

I wasn't able to get much done over the weekend except sell the wedding ring for some food/diaper money. Today however was really busy, I spoke to a few people I was able to get in contact with through legal aid! 

I'm told by the end of the week I should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything I need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so I can continue to survive until I can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

I'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

I am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

I probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure I was going to be OK and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! I also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that I won't make and explained the situation. They are somewhat understanding and hopefully I'll be back at work soon to keep current.

AITA for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?,"I've known James since we were 11. He's been my best friend for a long time and we're so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike AND even share a last name. He lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

I had a crush on him growing up and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined and said we were just best friends. He's really goofy with me, and treats me like I'm his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he's family. 

A couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I've always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I'm in the right place in life and I'm so happy. 

When James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. Won't go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn't feel like going to the mall, can't come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

My mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one I cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. He confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. He said 'I know it's really weird of me but it just creeps me out' 

I found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and I haven't heard from him since. I'm so upset that he's ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump!

We have been dating for awhile now and she's always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn't eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn't have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn't eat much since she's smaller but I didn't take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can't comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me's so often though since she's here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don't take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she's always making sure I'm taken care of and comfortable. I don't know if I should just suck it up because she's not taking much from me and if I'd be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?

My gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought ""haha this reminds me of me and JoyceManner!"", saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. All within 20 minutes of making this post! She thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

(Unpopular for cannabis users) I think weed culture is awful.,"I use cannabis everyday, I would be considered a ""stoner"" by most people. Weed culture is childish, cringy and counterproductive to the destigmatization of this wonderful drug. I would rather kick myself in the balls than own ANYTHING with a cannabis leaf drawn on it, wether it's shirt, a hat, an ashtray, a rolling tray, a poster a tattoo, a bong or a fucking sticker. People whose apparent jobs are to smoke weed on YouTube make me sick and if you look at recipes for edibles they will invade your reccomended videos.

 I went to a legal shop here in Montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there. They turned Bob Marley, a man who sang songs of love and unity, and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed. Every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes, if anything, Canadians should celebrate 10/17 (the day cannabis was legalized federally). And dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs.

 Every dealer I have had until my current suppliers have been arrogant douchebags who try and tell you you are ""smoking wrong"" and think they are your friends. I know it's shitty to bag on how people enjoy things but weed culture makes all cannabis users looks immature, lazy and stupid.
