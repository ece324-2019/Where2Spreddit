"discussion: veritasium's newest youtube video on simulating quantum mechanics with oil droplets!. over the past ten years, scientists have been exploring a system in which an oil droplet bounces on a vibrating bath as an analogy for quantum mechanics - check out veritasium's new youtube video on it!(https://youtu.be/wiytzdhuarq)

the system can reproduce many of the key quantum mechanical phenomena including single and double slit interference, tunneling, quantization, and multi-modal statistics. these experiments draw attention to pilot wave theories like those of de broglie and bohm that postulate the existence of a guiding wave accompanying every particle. it is an open question whether dynamics similar to those seen in the oil droplet experiments underly the statistical theory of quantum mechanics.

derek (/u/veritasium) will be around to answer questions, as well as prof. john bush (/u/profjohnbush), a fluid dynamicist from mit.

"for encouraging my 4y/o to push away another kid who keeps violently hugging her?. just had a fight with my so because of what i told our daughter about ""legit violence"". going to roll the story out as short as possible.

so there's this kid in my daughters day care. he's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. overall he's a cool little brat and i actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because i think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. anyway. my daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way ""too hard"" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. sometimes he kisses her in this situation. she says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. i saw those ""greetings"" some times and know what she means. 

she already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. 

so basically i told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. i said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. 

i watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied ""but he might push back or beat me if i do this"". i simply told her ""then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult"".

my so overhears our conversation and told me i'd be wrong here. that it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. i said i didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. i think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.

aita?

__________________
**edit:** holy crap, this exploded. thanks for the gold! i didn't expect to get so much feedback and thank everyone who participated in the still ongoing discussions.

i'll add some details here. 

1. my daughter told me this whilst we played legos. it was just some of those random kid stories that sometimes come out. this shows me it's something that she thinks about. i don't want her to develop a negative attitude towards her day care, so i considered this to be a small problem that could get bigger and therefore needed a solution.

2. i don't the other kid is a bully. his parents have a hard time as they also have a severely autistic older son that needs a lot of their time. and when they have time for him, they are overly careful. i also don't think that his behavior is a sign of sexual abuse, but he might be emotionally troubled.

3. i think that the daycare teachers do a good job but they don't have all-seeing-eyes. 

4. i wish my daughter becomes a straight forward, self-conscious and secure person that always finds ways to voice or show things that make her uncomfortable. i'd like her to know that she can talk to me and my so about everything, especially in her teen years.

"for offering my sister to pay for an abortion but not offering to support the child finacially if she keeps it?. some side info: my sister has two children (4yo, 2yo) and is married. for the last 2 years the barely made it to the end of the month and all of the family know they struggle finacially. me and my partner are doing well financially and have no kids.

two weeks ago my sister called me and asked me to come visit her, since there was something very important she needed to tell me. when i arrived she immediatly broke down crying, telling me how she was pregnant again and she ""doesn't know what to do"". she didn't even tell her husband at that point and i was very surprised to be the first person to know, since we're not really close.

anyway she continued saying that they don't have the means to support another child with all the debt they already deal with. i tried to calm her as much as i could, saying that there will sure be some solution to handle the situation. after a while she told me she looked up how much abortions cost and that even if she wanted to, she could not pay for it at the time.

so i basically offered that if she decides to abort, i would take care of all medical bills coming from that procedure. she asked me if i could afford that, so i told her she does not have to worry. since i don't use up all my money every month, i'm usually able to put some into savings and it was okay for me to put 2 of my mothly savings into her procedure, if she decides to have it.

she thanked me and told me that she needs time to think about it.

four days later she asked me to come visit again when her husband is home, so we could discuss how to go about it. i drove there at the same evening. they greeted me and her husband told me that he's really happy that i decided to help them in a tough time like that. she told me how she thought about what i said and she wanted to ""accept my offer"". however she didn't want the abortion but suggested that i should give them the money for the abortion as well as ""a little bit very month since i don't spend all my money anyway"". i was pretty much bewildered. i did not offer that. i told them straight forward that i will only give them money for the procedure, but won't be financially supporting them in any other way. her husband blew up, telling me i'm an asshole for ""wanting to pay to kill his child but not supporting them to make it live a good life instead"".

i was overwhelmed by the situation and left immediatly after.

my sister texted me the following days relentlessly about how i don't love her if i don't support her decision and how i'm forcing her into the abortion.

they also told the rest of the family which are also firm to believe i'm a massive asshole in the situation, because i don't need ""all that money to live and i could easily support them"".

"for ""being triggered"" by my boyfriend setting rules for my pregnancy weight gain?. hello, long time follower, first time poster. so my boyfriend knows that i have a lot of body image issues. i am a little overweight, and i struggle with it. i've tried a myriad of different diet plans and exercise routines over the years, but nothing seems to stick. my boyfriend and i both really want to have a big family, and i've confided in him before that i can't wait to have a baby, but the thought of being pregnant gives me a lot of anxiety because i don't want to gain weight.

so last night he calls me out of the blue, and says he just wanted to say ""i love you so much, and i can't wait to marry you and have babies with you because you'll make such a wonderful mother..."" and my heart is so full hearing this, and then he goes ""...but i can't have you go and ballooning up each pregnancy. you'll be 300 pounds by the time we're done having kids, and i'm not having sex with no big fat slob"" and when i pushed back, he doubled down and set me guidelines of how much weight i am allowed to gain each pregnancy, and that after birth, i'll get one month to ""relax"", then two months to get back to my pre-baby weight, and then i'll get pregnant again, and repeat.  

so we fought about it. i said he was being insensitive, and treating me like a sex-and-baby machine and not a human being. he tried to say he was only worried about my health (his dad died when he was a child from diabetes) and i was okay with that argument, but in trying to explain his health concerns, he kept digressing into such gems as: 
i'm not gonna stay married to you if i don't get hard looking at you
do you want our kids to be embarrassed by you? do you want them to say ""daddy, can you drop us off as school instead of mommy, because the other kids make fun of the way mommy waddles?
i love you, but my love is conditional, and the condition is not gaining more than 30 pounds. when the scale hits 31, i'm signing the divorce papers.
if you told me not to weigh 300 lbs, i'd say ""sure thing, babe, you're right"" but the fact that you won't agree to it means that you must actually want to weigh 300 lbs, so if that's your goal, good luck but we're breaking up if that's what you want
do you want our kids to be fat fucks too? you want to give them insulin shots in kindergarten because you and the babies sit on the couch all day feeding each other ding dongs? 

we've had a lot of fights in the past around my boyfriend being blunt by nature, and me being overly sensitive by nature, but i really think he was out of line. and the whole conversation came out of nowhere, which really makes me feel like my weight is something that was just eating away at him and he had to get it off his chest. but should i just let it go if he insists he's only worried about my health? with his family history, it's understandable that he'd worry about obesity and have a bit of a complex around it, and he is insisting that he's not asking for too much so i should just agree to it since gaining minimal weight is also what i want, so i shouldn't fight him and we just be in agreement?

"by giving a waiter the hang loose sign 🤙🏿. obligatory this happened years back, but it definitely warrants a posting here.

my wife and i were sent by the retail chain we worked for to a week long training out of state, at the companies headquarters. we quickly made friends with some of the other trainees, and we went out with them to explore the city and have some fun after classes one evening. ultimately, we ended up at a friday's restaurant at our hotel for some late evening dinner and drinks.

there were five of us at that friday's on that fateful evening. we were all laughing, drinking, and generally having a fun time. there was one problem, the service sucked. i mean sucked. the waiter took forever to come to the table to take orders, we had to go and get him at one point. after ordering the food also took nearly an hour to come out, and the server never said anything about it. when it came condiments, silverware, sides, you name it were missing... so this was aggravating.

the thing is, you need to imagine the waiter. he was a young guy, and talked just like a stereotypical surfer dude (we were in a rust belt city, so this was unusual).  e v e r y t i m e we interacted, from asking for napkins,  ketchup, another drink, where the food was, whatever, he would say someone like ""it's commming man"" or ""alright my dudes!"" or ""no problem, no worries"" and he would flash the hang loose sign 🤙🏿 🏄‍♂️ , smile, and didn't seem to have a care in the world. 

as you can imagine, a waiter nonchalantly responding to service requests/problems with the hang loose sign and surfer platitudes was amusing but more and more maddening as the night wore on. my wife, a new friend of ours who was an iraq war vet, and i took to privately mocking the ridiculous interaction when he wasn't around, flashing the hang loose sign while doing our best surfer dude voices (we were very young, i'd never do this now, think 21, 22 years old). 

and finally, for the fuck up. towards the end of all this, the server never brought a bill after nearly an hour... my new war vet friend finally flagged him down and asked for it, and the waiter again flashed the hang loose sign, and said ""i'll get it my man"" 🤙🏿. my friend says ""okay my man! while flashing a big smile and the hang loose 🤙🏿 back at him. my friend, my wife, and i thought this was hilarious, but we noticed that the other two friends at the table weren't laughing (i mean it wasn't really mean spirited or nasty, just goofy and exasperated), so i asked them what was wrong. the guy says ""dudes got no fingers man!"" the world stopped spinning. it all came together, in the dim light of the friday's the servers deformed hand, which had just a pinky and a thump and a lump in the middle had been mistaken by us for a hang loose sign. i mean he talked like a server and wagged the damn thing at us all night, but we hadn't seen it clearly....

my friend was mortified. this cool, tough, recently returned war vet, literally melted away at the table. he ultimately silently got up and just left us there. i didn't know wtf to do so i apologized to the waiter and told him what we had thought he was doing, and it wasn't intended to mock his disability, but i don't know what he thought... 

tldr: had very bad service at friday's by a surfer sounding waiter who seemingly kept flashing us the hang loose sign all night 🤙🏿. we were making fun of it when he wasn't around, but eventually a friend of mine, exasperated with his surfer speak, service, and hang loose sign gave the sign back to him and asked for the bill. other's at the table looked mortified. i asked them why, and the guy said ""dudes got no fingers man!""  this turned out to be the actual case. he in fact had a pinky and a thumb, and nothing else, which for some reason he shook vertically to gesture while speaking. fuck.

"99% of women are attractive if they're fit. like the title states, 99% of fit women are attractive. there was this post of kurdish women soldiers on r/pics today, and the comment section was filled with highly upvoted variations of ""they only chose attractive women"". this is silly. the vast majority of fit women are attractive. **being fit is attractive**, and it applies to both sexes. that's why advice for guys is often ""hit the gym"". those women looked attractive(although a couple looked plain) because they're in shape. did you expect them to pick huge ones? do they even have huge women soldiers? to anyone that got ""triggered"" with that pic, you can be attractive too if you hit the gym and get fit. to anyone that disagrees, find me a pic of a large group of fit women where 50%+ are unattractive.

edit: i'd like to clarify some things. by fit, i meant having a healthy bmi. you don't have to exercise and be ripped to achieve that. also, the statement that 99% of fit women are attractive does not mean that you have to be fit to be attractive. there are lots of hot and awesome thick woman out there, but i think over 50% of big women are unattractive.",6
"if you engage in identity politics, you are a tool of the ultra-wealthy, dividing up the working class. if you engage in identity politics, such as race, sex, gender, or even blue team vs red team (in the usa) you are an idiot.

"fat girls are not inspirational or beautiful. i'm so tired of seeing fat girls on instagram, or anywhere really, having the same basic story. ""she was bullied, told she was overweight and ugly. but she's overcome that and become a model and look how beautiful she is"". despite the fact that without editing she looks like a greasy blue whale. 

they are not beautiful or inspirational. girls might not like it, but fatness is ugly. it says a lot about you as a person that you would let your body get like that and then let it stay like that. you are not beautiful or inspirational if you are fat. no one. and i repeat, no one wants wants to be you. people feel sorry for you because you put yourself in a position that puts you at a huge disadvantage. 

you are not beautiful or inspirational. you are dying. there is nothing beautiful or sexy about heart disease, diabetes, strokes, ankle tape, size h bras, multiple chins, intaking 3000 calories a day or the constant whining that you always direct towards skinny girls. 

side note: not talking about girls who are thick, that's totally different. having a curvy body shape is not the same as being fat. however the number of fat girls who claim to be ""thicc"" is absurd. there is such a massive gulf between girls who are thick and girls who are fat. it makes you look stupid to even think you're thick if you're actually just fat 😂",6

"i'm sick of how people with above-average student loan debts are treated in this sub (and why you should be too). i have been lurking a lot in here for the past few months (with a couple posts) to try and figure out my financial situation. as i read more and more, i find myself disgusted with how you guys treat people with student loan debt above the average (which is like 30k now). 

my story is probably similar to a lot of the loan carriers, so i will share an abbreviated version of it:

it is 2006. i am entering my senior year of high school, and my dad and mom are both working, doing well. combined, they are probably making about 250-300k. they, along with the rest of pre-recession america, are telling me college is the way to middle class, and that they have saved up enough for me to go almost anywhere that's not ivy league. i chose a university that costs about 26k a year.

fast forward a bit. it's 2009. my dad has lost his business, and is now using my college savings to keep everything afloat. i am about to enter my junior year of college, and my parents tell me i will have to take loans out to continue. i have suffered two years in engineering already, and do not wish to quit. i continue on.

it's 2011. i graduate, and although i have a job lined up, many of my friends didn't. america is now telling us ""college is worthless lol"" and the grim realization hits us that the entire economy has changed. i cannot move home because i decided to keep my sanity instead of my money, and at this point my dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mother was extremely depressed.

i do not share this out of pity. i have about 62k of loans and am making 75k, so i will be paying them off within a few years. but god dahmit, there are people worse off and i feel for them, because i chose a career that makes money simply because it's what i enjoyed most. i got lucky. if i enjoyed something that didn't pay as much, i would be in a much worse situation.

if we want to have serious conversations about this, we cannot expect every 17-18 year old to have the financial knowledge of accountants. most of the progenitors of college students also have extremely lacking financial knowledge, which is why you hear of this in the first place. most 18 year olds are thinking about beer and having sex (well, i still think about that a lot), not about retirement, 401ks, healthcare, etc. you can think it's wrong all you want, but that is reality. 

so i ask of you, please get off your high horse. none of us are rich, and most of us will never be. we are all in this rat race together. instead of saying ""screw you i got mine"", be more accepting of the fact that people are actually making an effort to pay their debt, and will speak highly of this sub. thank you.

since so many people commented i m going to give you a bit more details. i had a ons with this girl 2 months ago and at that point she did not have a bf.

but we live in different cities so i didn t see her for some weeks, then when i was back at her city i texted her to meet up  again, it s the morning after that we had slept together again that she told me about having a bf. i told her that there was no point in being with him since she s not happy and it s a that point that i first thought about telling him. she then agreed and told me that she ll end it with him and i believe she did. we saw each other for some days but i could not see her being my girlfriend because she had told me that she had cheated on all her previous boyfriends, so what we had was casual.

after that i saw her again a few weeks later but she had gotten back with her previous boyfriend who has no idea about me. the thing is that i feel sorry for him because she is his first gf and it ll destroy him if he finds out. that s why i m not sure what i should do, because on one hand it s none of business but on the other i would want to know if i was him. 

now i ll answer some questions that i saw multiple times

i can t put a note under the toilet seat because she lives with her parents so the father will see it first

"for getting my coworker's $2,000 vacation taken away?. some background, my little sister is in the army. i haven't seen her since august for a funeral. she hasn't really been able to take leave because she was flagged for her weight. finally, she tells me in early december that she got approved to go on leave at the end of january, so i immediately went and put in for my vacation time at work. i haven't stopped talking about it and made everyone aware that i was taking this time to see my sister.

my job has a super strict first come, first served policy about taking vacations. my department only has 8 people and it's considered a trade so you can't just pull anyone off the street to cover for one of us, so only one person is allowed to take vacation at a time.

i came to visit finally, yesterday, and my mother's health, unfortunately, seems to have declined more than she let on.

the whole house is *full* of cats. hundreds of cats, some of them look to be pregnant, and some of them already have litters. 300 may be an understatement. i asked her where they came from and she didn't have an answer for me. i told her she needs to get rid of them but she insisted they were better off with her.

to make matters worse, the guest room has been filled entirely with various birds. parakeets, finches, a *swan* (she says it's a swan) and various others i can't identify. i estimate there's 50+ birds, and they too look as if they've been breeding.

all the animals have food afaik, but the smell is unbearable and this cannot be sanitary. you can't move without stepping on a cat. who do i call? the police? i'd prefer if there was a way to resolve this without her getting charged for animal cruelty, she's just a harmless old lady who is suffering from dementia.

**time #1:** last christmas i made her a diy kit and individually wrapped all of the parts (yarn, glue, stamps, glitter, cards, etc...). i wanted her to open up the smaller gifts first because i was really excited about some of the big stuff. she asked me what she should open first, so i grabbed the smallest box i could find (it was just a rubber stamp...the size of a ring box) and jokingly said something like ""i know it's what you've always wanted""...oops.

**time #2:** our friend had just returned from the international space university in france (it's a real thing). he graduated at the top of his class and they gave him a medallion in a jewelry box. i called my girlfriend into the room with the box closed and said something stupid and yeah...oops.

**time #3:** my girlfriend started an etsy shop so i had a custom stamp made of her logo. i was excited to surprise her with it and ended up texting her the day it came in: ""i have a big surprise for you when you get home!"". when she finally got home i told her to close her eyes and put out her hand...oops.

***tl;dr:*** the universe gave me the perfect proposal and i shit all over it.

**edit #2:** woah-- she isn't going to leave me...she knows how much karma i bring to the table. no way she's gonna' let ***this*** go.

**edit #3:** she left me.(http://i.imgur.com/ds9utgw.png)

**edit #4:** loljk. her seeing stuff like this(http://i.imgur.com/jmtyvgx.png) has warmed her numb little heart more than breaking up with me ever would.

**edit #5:** itt -- people who have never dated a rational human being with a good sense of humor.

**edit #6:** we are engaged

**edit #7:** oh, sorry. i accidentally hit **save** too soon. what i meant to say was *""we are engaged in debate over which of the four fuck ups was the worst.""*...oops.

"take the doors off fridges when moving/installing them. it makes them immensely lighter and more maneuverable.. edit 1: since people are getting technical about things here. you can also use an appliance cart or air sled. i was just trying to give an easy tip that could be done with a screwdriver.

edit 2: the side by side's we'd sell were 450 lbs of long, tall, and wide machine. one of the doors would have a built-in ice maker and electronics inside it. that door was easily 50 lbs if not more by itself. then, you still have the other side door and the bottom freezer door. removing the doors made it close to 100 lbs lighter. no, even with a standard dolly, i can't move 450 lbs up and down stairs without damaging property. plus, you can keep the doors from being damaged by moving them separately. 

edit 3: i don't know if this voids the warranty. i just installed and repaired the appliances. however, we'd do this to almost every new fridge we'd deliver. there was never a problem with the manufacturer and i don't even know how they'd know it was done. i mean it's just screws for the doors and hinges and clips for the waterline and electronic line. there wasn't any tape or any type of system to show that the doors had been tampered with. 

edit 4: if your fridge has water and electronic lines running through the door, unclip the lines 1st before unscrewing that door. 

edit 5: all contractors out there. can you not install those super tiny really high hard to reach cabinets over the fridge space. no one really uses them and the fridges are only getting taller. we would either have to rip them out or have the client buy a smaller model. ",8
"if i followed through on my ultimatum of not coming to thanksgiving because of my sister's awful boyfriend?. my younger sister (30f) has been dating ""jerry"" for 3 years. he's a loud-mouth who holds ignorant, bigoted, and homophobic views. i have no clue what my sister sees in him as no one in my family shares his perceptions. here's what the first thanksgiving was like with him (he was meeting my family for the first time). he brought up the recent election and called me a ""snowflake"" because he knew i didn't vote for trump ( i guess my sister told him since i didn't know him before this.) he went on about how awesome trump was and how awesome this country is now going to be. i didn't engage because i thought he was  foolish, how he had no idea who my parents voted for and still thought it was appropriate to run his mouth nonstop at the dinner table the first time meeting all of us. after more than two hours of this, my mother finally asked him to change the subject. 

fast forward to now. he has, on more than one occasion, brought up that if his kids ""ever decide they are \insert vulgar word for gay here that begins with an f\"" that he'll disown them, and other awful things along the same lines. i'm the only one that pushes back, usually asking him why he'd say that, which usually fires him up even more. there's no having a respectful conversation with him. my sister just jokes and laugh it off every time he says something blatantly racist or ignorant. my parents cringe and try to change the subject. 

the final straw came when he went on social media and made comments about my relationship. he tried to call out my boyfriend and me because we both have good careers and split household expenses. he thinks this is wrong because ""you're in a relationship, you shouldn't be nickel and diming each other like you're just roommates, what's wrong with you two? doesn't he take care of you?"" which is hilarious because he's in his 30's, he moved in with my sister who pays for everything after two weeks of dating, only works part-time by choice and has no savings whatsoever. 

i blocked him and called my mother. i vented to her that i don't appreciate any of misogynistic/bigoted/homophobic views and he's a loser. my mom agreed with me but said she wishes we could all get along. my boyfriend and i live a plane ride away and i told her i wouldn't be coming to thanksgiving this year if he was. i said because they, meaning my parents and sister, just sit there while he talks, that that makes them complicit to the hateful commentary and i don't want to be associated with someone like him. my mom was understandably upset and said i was her priority since she never gets to see me, but that she couldn't tell my sister not to bring him. my dad is sick about this and wants everyone to shut up and get along. i feel i have reached my limit, but some of my extended family members feel like i should just suck it up since it would really crush my parents since i live far away if i didn't see them on a holiday. 

if i didn't come to thanksgiving at my parents?",3

"if lie to my husband about having a miscarriage when in reality i'll be getting an abortion?. i 32(f) and my husband 41(m) have been together for 12 years and married for 11. 6 months into our marriage, we had our lovely daughter belle, who passed away when she was 2 years old. after my daughter's passing my husband had an affair with his close friend which resulted in a baby girl zoe. now zoe's mother was a troubled woman who suffered from post partum depression, which ultimately took her life. my husband was regretful of his actions and worked hard to prove that he was willing to be loyal from that day that on. i decided to forgive him and accept the baby as my own. 

zoe is now 6 years old and is a bright young girl. i love her but one thing which has been bothering me a lot is that zoe looks a lot like her mother. somehow when i look at her face for too long, i get triggered. 

after the cheating, i've struggled with being intimate with my husband. things improved in the last 3 years, and my husband had recently expressed his desire of having another child. he has been really desperate for a baby. now all this time, i've taken pills in secret, however, i ended up conceiving 2 months ago on a family trip. 

i forgot to take pills one morning, and  ended up pregnant. my husband is beyond excited. he cried happy tears when i told him about the pregnancy.

 zoe has been going all around telling her friends that she was going to become a big sister. my inlaws feel that this baby will finally heal our wounds. my husband talks to my belly all the time. he is being incredibly affectionate and loving. he gets emotional wherever he talks about the baby. 

now the biggest problem is that i don't feel connected to this baby at all. recently, an ex came into my life after 10 years. we have reconnected and our friendship is going strong. we often talk about our lives. he recently got cheated on and left, so we've talked to each other about our experiences. 

things took a drastic turn for me last week when i saw a dream. in the dream, i had just given birth to my baby and my husband was there holding our baby in his arms. when i looked up to see my husband's face, i saw my ex. my actual husband wasn't there in the dream and neither was zoe. 

ever since i saw the dream, i've come to the realization that i no longer see a future with my husband. i do want a family of my own someday, but i don't want a baby with him. 


i've been thinking of getting an abortion but can't tell my husband because it will destroy him. i really want to leave this marriage and start over. i want to explore where things go with my ex. our relationship ended because of distance and bad timing. i'm pretty positive my ex still has feelings for me, but has never expressed his feelings out of respect for my marriage. 

if lie to my husband about having a miscarriage when in reality i'll be getting an abortion? i plan to divorce him next year so i don't want him to know that i didn't want this baby and hurt him more.",3

1) **state my case** - was direct, asking for an increase in compensation, with high-level logic.

2) **logic** - went into detail on my work, the value i bring, and the positive feedback i've received.

3) **data** - linked data on median pay for my role/responsibilities from sites such as bureau of labor & statistics, glassdoor.com, and salary.com. 

4) **conclusion** - recapped my logic and data. closed strong with the direct request to increase my pay to $90k with a date of july 1st. (fy17)

to those of you who asked if i'm ok; tbh not really but i will be. the darkness in my mind waxes and wanes and yesterday was a bit heavier than i'm used to, probably due to pain that's been keeping me from sleeping well the past month. i'm working on getting better at asking for help and expressing how i truly feel all the time, not just when i'm happy. i'd explain more of what i'm going through but i have a hard enough time doing that with friends, as this post has gotten much more attention than i was expecting i'll just say that i'm working on getting better one day at a time.

"california - tennant theft issue. i purchased my first rental house in october and have been renting it to a college student since late december. i felt pretty comfortable renting it to this student because his dad owns a building moving company and had deep pockets, so i didn't need to worry too much about if they did damage to the property and i could expect rent on time. the father signed on the rental contract and pays the rent.

in january the ac unit in the house went out and i was quoted several thousand to get it replaced. due to unrelated personal financial issues i wasn't able to get the work done immediately. i didn't want to leave my tenant without ac so i offered his father the chance to prepay 4 months rent so i could get the ac replaced immediately. i was just trying to make the best of a bad situation. 

the father was rightly pissed and chewed me out over the phone for a bit. two days later he showed up at my house drunk and threatening/screaming/etc and saying i'd pay for screwing his son. he left after i threatened to call the police. i never heard anything from him after this, but rent kept showing up, so i decided to forget about it since the son shouldn't suffer for his fathers faults. 

i finally had the money to get the ac replaced so i scheduled the contractor to have it installed on wednesday. texted the son that the ac would be replaced on wednesday and he just said ""haha sure"". on wednesday the contractor couldn't find the house. he told me there was no house at the address i gave him. i double checked the address with the realtor and against some documents i had but the contractor insisted it was wrong, so i scheduled him again yesterday morning so i could drive him to the house. the contractor was right, there's no longer a home at the address.

the father and son aren't responding to me any longer, but i've left voicemails. the neighbors confirmed that the house had indeed been taken by the fathers moving company. i'm really kind of shocked. i don't even know how to precede. the only reason i'm not freaking out is i know that i the father has the money the pay for this monumental fuck up. will insurance cover this sort of thing? what type of lawyer do i need? if i find the house will i have ownership of the land it's on? will i need to move it back to my property? can a house be moved twice? does this sort of thing require a permit, and could i get in trouble if he didn't have one? really any advice would be helpful, there are so many questions now.",2

before i moved in she told me about her $80,000 in debt.  she was making $60,000 a year. i stepped up and said i would pay the rent and utilities so that she would have the extra money to pay her debt down.

its 30 months later now. she quit her job 10 months ago because she didn't like the work load or the people she worked for. she wanted to get a cpa to make more money, she said, and she wanted to quit so that she could have time study for the exam. i supported her decision. 

then she did not study very hard, took one part, failed and decided to get a new job. she interviewed a few times. then she decided to stop looking for work. just told me one day...  she doesn't want to work. 

now i'm told, as a man - i need to take care of all the money things.  her college debts are my problem now. she refuses to work, she might try to make some money sewing. she says i need to support her.  she tells me it's only $1,000 a month more and that i don't know how to spend my money and that she should manage my cash flow.

"wife broke her back in the dominican and we're at a loss for what to do. as the title says. this is a total nightmare scenario and like most people who would be in this situation too, were completely ignorant as too how we should proceed. 

the story: my wife and i traveled to the dominican republic for a vacation at an all inclusive resort. yesterday afternoon while she was walking by a pool she stepped on a foam raft that someone had left laying out and slipped. this only arose because she cut her foot on a broken tile in the pool and was getting out as it was bleeding everywhere. her legs went out from underneath of her and she fell straight down onto her pelvis onto the hard tile floor. it took 30 minutes for resort staff to show up with a wheelchair, which was absolutely necessary as my wife was unable to walk without it causing excruciating pain. they took us to the small resort clinic to examine her but they were only outfitted to treat small scrapes and sprains. after the nurse there determined that this was out of her league she called an ambulance to take us to the hospital. once at the hospital her pain was largely ignored and she was forced to sit/stand/walk 20 or 30 times with the back injury. after x-rays were inconclusive and difficult to read the doctor did a ct scan to reveal that she had 1 shattered vertabrae and a slipped disc. at this point he obviously recommend that she not move from a laid down position. it's honestly a miracle they didn't paralyze her or cause obvious and immediate damage during everything. the hotel agreed to pay for the transport to the hospital and the initial examinations (including the ct) but has pretty much washed their hands of us once she had to be admitted. oh also, in order for them to pay for the ct they made me sign a release saying that their responsibilities had been fulfilled and we could no longer seek more help from them. 

we don't have travel insurance. we don't have out of country medical coverage from our regular us healthcare providers. i checked with our credit cards and they only offer reimbursement for ""catastrophic"" charges incurred. apparently this doesn't qualify. i'm waiting to hear back from our homeowners insurance to see what coverage's they offer outside of the united states. 

so at this moment we're in a foreign country with a huge language barrier, footing a potentially massive hospital bill unless we can get back to the united states and into our own healthcare network. apparently a medical flight where she's able to be prone can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 which of course, we don't happen to have just sitting around. i feel totally helpless as a husband right now watching my wife in pain and knowing that our financial future could be destroyed.  

sorry for the long post but we've been awake for 24 hours with no near end in sight.

tl;dr: my wife broke her back in the dr and we have no medical insurance in this country. we're just looking for a way home that won't send us into bankruptcy.

"by setting two of my friends up on a blind date. obligatory-this happened in the last 2 weeks

one of my friends (17m) was talked about how he wants a girlfriend again a few months ago. i was the patient listener, and very open when he asked if i knew any ""cute girls."" i thought it was a strange talk for us to have considering the fact that i disagree with his frequent encounters of the bedroom kind with various girls, but nevertheless i kept my eye out. 

then about a month ago, one of my friends (17f) mentioned she had a massive crush on my friend (after she'd seen his picture and watched him play football). this was perfect! he's attractive, she's attractive, it totally worked on the superficial level. all i had to do now was to introduce them. the chatted over text (she doesn't have social media at the moment)and they met up two weeks later. i don't generally endorse the blind dating thing, but i hoped it would work out. 

the official date happened about 2 weeks ago. they went to a little restaurant around the corner from her high school. she texted me immediately after, saying it was great. they'd ordered food, walked around, and in typical behavior, he initiated and they made out. i just assumed everything went well. the next weekend, they hung out again. that is, until she called me afterwards crying. she told me that they'd been talking and she told him she thought the date was going well and he had replied with something along the lines of ""ehhh, i don't know. i've had better."" laughed and then ""because, lets face it, you are fucking disgusting. you're so ugly. i don't know why \_\_\_\_\_\_ paired us up, i mean, i'm leagues ahead of you. if i'm not getting any, it's not worth it. i'm not gonna fucking marry you."" and then left. i was so shocked, i thought she was kidding (spoiler alert: she wasn't) i texted him immediately and asked him what the hell he was doing. he told me that he didn't care how she felt because she should have know he was out of her league and he only wanted sex. and that he hated her eyes because ""it made her look asian"" i wasn't expecting it but it made me really angry and stupid for pairing them up in the first place.

 (of course i couldn't know how much of a racist dick he was because he's never acted like that before but still.)

i get that he is definitely the worst in this situation, but still. i paired them up and she's still upset about that. i feel fucking terrible for the way he treated her

cost of living here is very high, and as such, i'm still living at home. i save about $1,000 to $1,500 a month, and currently have $10,500 in the bank. my goal is to be able to save enough for a down payment on a home within the next 2-3 years. i have excellent credit, with a current score of 788.

i have several paths from here i can take. military and law enforcement are constants, but both have pretty big negatives. military would remove me from my home and my family, and law enforcement is difficult to get into, especially with five traffic tickets on my record in the last few years.

going back to school is another big step i want to take, but there are so many options, with so few ways to know which will pay off the best. i have a ba in english from the cal state university program, which is largely useless, and it's preventing me from being able to go back into a bachelor's program. as such, i would need to either get into a trade school or an aa program. i've considered paralegal, computer science, and business, while leaning pretty heavily towards computer science.

i also intend to start making use of khan academy and other free resources to build a knowledge database for business and programming, but have no idea how applicable my accomplishments with those programs will be for getting a job.

please offer me any advice, big or small. i welcome all of it. feeling like i've wasted my life up to now and have no idea where to go.

update: sorry for the late update, but thanks to a lot of the advice and encouragement that came out of this thread, i'm now employed as a legal assistant and technical writer for a growing mortgage firm in south orange county, ca. i make about 33% more than i did at my previous job, and i'm staying at home while i continue to save every penny i can to buy a house in the next year-and-a-half or so. i'm also considering moving out of state when that time comes.

i can't thank you guys enough. i was on the verge of tears when i made that thread, and i'm starting to feel my feet stabilize a bit under me. still a long road to go, and i need to be smarter and less complacent than i was in the six years i stagnated at my last company, but i've got a fire in my belly i haven't had before. it's a good feeling.

"for telling my parents they won't be invited to my wedding?.. my fiance and i have been dealing with a conflict with my parents for just over a year now. 


my fiance is on the autism spectrum, so sometimes has difficulty with social etiquette, relationships, body language etc. 

my family has been aware of this for years, even before we started dating. 

they take a lot of issue with him, even back when we were in high school. him and my dad argued about the name of a restaurant and my dad called him an arrogant asshole for insisting he was wrong. 

more recently, an incident occurs where my fiance tries to have a discussion with my parents about a book that his mom (who is a parenting author) just released. my dad felt offended by this and thought that my fiance meant they were no good at parenting. he went on to yell at the both of us, swearing and calling my fiance names including ""retard"" (which he took offense to given his diagnosis. my father knows this)

they both sort of didn't address it again but we asked for an apology. we did not receive it. rather, we got several texts that were aggressive in nature from my dad, and guilt-trippy messages from my mom to just move on from it. 

a few weeks ago, my sister made a post on social media holding her friend's baby. my fiance commented jokingly ""is it yours"". now, i know it was a joke and sometimes he doesn't understand that jokes can have ""wrong"" audiences and jokes can be badly timed. my parents didn't give him that grace and sent us messages about how his behaviour seems to be reckless and potentially dangerous and the comment was shameful. my mom's message said they did not give their blessing for my engagement. my father's text said the same thing but also included ""are you really trying to tell me that boy/man with all his mental deficiencies is really good for your life??? that's a tough sell my dear."" 

i chose not to respond because i felt like it was aggressive.

today i sent a message to my mother to convey my thoughts and make some things clear to her. in it i said that if they didn't give their blessing, they shouldn't expect an invitation to our wedding. 

in some ways i feel unsure about this. my sister recently told me that i'm being disrespectful to them and i should be grateful that they gave me a great life.

i know the whole saying ""family is family"" but i can't help but wonder, where's the line? when is it ok to say no, you won't put up with it anymore? 

for saying they won't be invited?.",3
"for making my children wash their clothes in the bathtub with dollar store detergent?. my kids are aged 14 m and 15 f. the other day my son asked if i could wash his favorite shirt for some event coming up, so i told him i would and to put it in the hamper. later that day i found it just sitting on the floor so i didn't bother. same thing with my daughter, she asked me to wash something (don't remember what) and she got the same response. same thing happened with the piece of clothing on the floor instead of the hamper so i didn't bother

later in the evening they started bitching about the clothes they requested not being washed and i told them ""all you had to do was put it in the hamper"" to which my son said ""yeah but it was near the hamper you can just pick it up"" to which my daughter agreed. i didn't say anything more about the issue

the next morning i went to the dollar store and bought some laundry detergent. when my kids came down for breakfast it was sitting on the table, and they asked what it was. i informed them that until they stop being entitled spoiled brats that they can wash their own clothes, but not with my washing machine. i informed them they will be washing all their clothes from now on in the bath tub with dollar store detergent until they start being respectful and i receive an apology for the remarks about picking up their crap near the hamper and once the detergent runs out they have to use their own money to buy more but they're only allowed to buy it at the dollar store. then came more whining and bitching 

it's been a week and they still haven't apologized and i'm saving time, money and water on only washing mine and my husband's clothes. my husband said i'm being ""harsh"" but i don't think so. so am i the asshole for teaching my kids a lesson?",3

it was settled out of court.  
i want to thank everyone for the advice and words of support. i followed everyone's advice and contacted my insurance company. they got back to me very quickly and took over the situation. everything was settled out of court. the insurance company ended up paying the full amount of her estimation, rather than just the small claims maximum. it was well within my insurance limits, so i'm not really surprised at that outcome. i really hope it does help her. with her and city counsel's permission i actually commissioned a small plaque with 'in memory of child's name' with birth year and death year below it and affixed it to the stone bench at the park.

on a more personal note, i really want to thank everyone who suggested i get some counseling. there was a large weight pressing down on me that i didn't even realize was there until it started to lift. i don't know how long i would have just lived with it without everyone's advice to get help. so thank you again.",2

"no one should apologize for their countries past expansions or conquests. land earned through historical wars are not stolen land.. too often i see people saying things like you can't be an illegal immigrant on stolen land (i'm not arguing on immigration).  this is primarily spoken of america, and i hear it quite often. however there are scores of countries that conquered each other, enslaved each other, killed and raped each other. why is it america is the only one judged for this? because it's more successful than its contemporaries? the ancient world was filled with conquest and slavery, yet now, only one country was founded on its admittedly abhorrent pillars? it's ridiculous.

"during the process of repairing an acquaintance's laptop, i found a folder containing several videos and photos of child pornography. i'm freaking out about it, and don't know exactly how i should handle telling the authorities.. throwaway account for obvious reasons

quick background: i work in it security, but have a few side jobs that i do for fun/extra money. one of those side jobs is repairing laptop computers, tablets, cell phones, etc. i also do custom pc builds for people as well.

so, the way i network is through word of mouth, and business cards. long story short, a guy at my kickboxing academy approached me and asked if i could fix his laptop. he told me he was having performance issues, and complained that his pc freezes and blue screens with no warning.

i go through the normal routine, and have him sign a contract agreeing to pay me for my services, as well as granting me full control over the device while i carry out repairs, etc. 

he agreed, and asked that if the computer can't be fixed, at least recover his files to the best of my ability and place them on an external drive for safe keeping. 

now, i have a big disclaimer that i have the person sign off on that literally reads as follows: ""i will respect the privacy of your data, however i will look into any area that the problems you're having may lead me to. that being said is there anything on the computer that you would not want me to see?"" if the user says yes, i tell them to clean up the computer and bring it back when its safe for me to look at. i'm not interested in looking at naked pictures of the guy or his wife, for example. this guy said no, and signed off on the disclaimer.

long story short, the laptop was an older model but i was able to get everything up and running again. however, this is where the story gets messed up. 

after running a quick virus scan on the machine, i notice over 100 malicious items being found. 80ish of which were located in one folder. so, i crack open the folder to take a look, as a lot of people download malicious software without really knowing what they're getting into. 

well, i found an entire series of photos and videos on the computer. i clicked one (stupidly) and saw a young girl (pre-adolescent) engaged in sexual activity with an adult. the others had similar file names, and were clearly pornographic videos and photos from what little i could see in the thumbnail. honestly, i've never felt more sick to my stomach than i did last night when i saw that picture.

my mind is a mess right now. i couldn't sleep last night and i'm not really sure what to do. i took screen shots of the file system to prove that they were last modified/viewed before i received the computer as to not implicate myself in any way. 

how in the hell am i supposed to report this?

"$15,000 missing from bank of america accounts. pennsylvania, us

i just awoke from a nap to find an email that one of my accounts with boa fell below a $25 balance. i logged on to my account to find a $1,000 ""cashed check hold on 11/21"" transaction on my checking account and 5 separate transactions for $1,000, three for 3,000 and one for 4,000 from my savings account.

i immediately called their customer service line and was directed to the claims department. the representative basically gave me no information aside from telling me ""these are check cash holds"" that had to have been initiated by a teller (?) and asked if i had written any checks for these amounts. i don't have any checks for my savings account, and obviously i have not done so or i wouldn't have called the customer service line in a panic.

she told me i'd need to call their check cashing department (i don't believe i have that name right) which had closed 5 minutes prior to my call, so now i have to wait until tomorrow.

does anyone have any experience with this happening with bank of america? she wasn't able to give me any information as far as my next steps or what to expect going forward.

edit: wow, this got way more attention than i expected. thank you everyone for the information. as mentioned in a few comments i'll be visiting the branch tomorrow and calling the check fraud department if nothing gets resolved on site. i'll also be opening new accounts with a different institution and migrating direct deposit and automatic payments. i'll post an update here tomorrow for anyone curious.

***update:*** i just got off of the phone with the check fraud department. they opened two claims for each account. as of this morning, the transactions are no longer ""pending"" and have new descriptions along the lines of ""md tlr cash withdrawal from chk #### banking ctr <location, #> confirmation# <#>"", for four different locations in maryland. i think the most likely explanation is that someone got into my online banking, got my account numbers, physically went to these branches and made the withdrawals at the counter. seems pretty ballsy.

the fraud department froze both of my accounts and my debit card (i now have two balances of -888,000). i'll be going to the branch to provide some additional information and file a police report, per the discussion i had with the fraud department. they said it could take up to 60 business days for them to complete their investigation, at which time i may need to fill out an affidavit and be able to get my money back.

***update 2:*** i visited the branch this morning and the manager was very helpful, giving me additional information on the investigation (and subsequent refunding) process. so, shoutout to mr. ramos. he opened new accounts & issued a temporary debit card which i will probably not even be using, and was able to get the remaining funds i had available (~$750.00) transferred over from the frozen accounts. he told me i should fax the police report to the fraud department, then call and speak to a manager and they should be able to issue a provisional credit for the full amounts that were stolen. he seemed as baffled as anyone else that these were apparently in-person transactions at 4 different branches in maryland (these branches all appear to be along highway 355 from frederick down to gaithersburg) and no one raised any alarm bells. he said ""we have safeguards in place, this shouldn't have happened"".

the two officers i spoke to at my local pd said similar things, that the perpetrator must have used a fake id, gone to each bank and gotten a blank check and filled it out with my account numbers. unfortunately i live in a pretty small town and they told me the report wouldn't be ready until friday or possibly monday, but in the mean time i've given the case number to the fraud department.

here's a brief timeline of the events and my actions:

* fraudster acquired my account details by some currently unknown method (possibly through a data breach/online banking hack, no checks were stolen or lost that i'm aware of, and my personal computers & devices are all free of malware)
* fraudster visited four separate bank of america branches in maryland and drained my accounts in six separate transactions on 11/21, probably using a fake id.
* i received a low balance notification on 11/21 and called bank of america customer service line at 7:50 pm - was not given much information and told to call check fraud department in the morning
* i made this personal finance post, and on the advice of a few users started documenting everything including drafting a letter to send to the fraud department
* called check fraud department at 8:10 am on 11/22, accounts and debit card were frozen and two fraud cases opened
* visited my local branch and spoke with the branch manager, new accounts opened and available funds transferred
* visited local pd and spoke with two officers - gave them copies of my fraud department letter and all supporting documents

next steps:

* open new accounts with local credit union to use once this is resolved
* get copy of police report on friday or monday to fax to fraud department
* call fraud department and hassle manager for provisional credit
* wait for up to 60 days for fraud investigation to complete, everyone i spoke to indicated this shouldn't take this long and would almost certainly resolve in my favor
* hopefully local & md police can identify the perp and arrest them because doing this to someone is widely regarded as a ""dick move""

i'm not really sure what else to add at this point - i'll update again with any new developments - but at this point i'll be **disabling inbox replies** for this post as the comments coming in now (like at least 20 essentially saying ""fuck bank of america""/""don't use bank of america"") aren't very helpful. i've already stated several times i'll be switching institutions, though i may keep the new boa accounts open with minimal balances ""just in case"". i'll be moving the majority of my assets to the local cu.

big thanks to everyone who did leave helpful comments and offer their sympathies - i really appreciate it. if anyone has additional suggestions or questions that haven't been answered, feel free to pm me or reply to one of my comments below. if you leave a top-level comment i probably won't see it after saving this update.

"i found two websites illegally publishing my knitting and crochet patterns. (maine). long story short i have a store online (through etsy and ravelry) where i publish knitting and crochet patterns. i sell them and make a good amount of sales and a decent little income for a graduate student. 

all of my patterns are published and etsy says they become copyrighted the second they are published. i also have a copyright notice within the pattern and in the item's listing description noting that it is illegal to claim this pattern as your own and publish it anywhere. 

today i found all of my patterns listed on two different websites. one is french and the other doesn't explicitly say where they are based out of. they are both selling my patterns extremely cheap and obviously illegally. 

what can i do to prevent this from continuing? i've heard of cease and desist letters (this is a somewhat common issue in the knitting and crochet pattern designing community) but do i need a lawyer to write it and send it? i've never had this issue and would appreciate any advice on where to go from here.

i have not yet contacted either website.

i only sell my patterns on two sites (etsy and ravelry).

"by attempting to break up a bar fight.. this story begins friday night, when my mother offered to watch my son overnight so i figured i'd go scope out my old hangout spot.  i get there, everything goes just fine until these two guys (guy a and guy b) start getting mad at each other over a game of pool.

this first disagreement was resolved quick and painlessly, no problem right?  boy was i wrong.

i used to bartend at this bar so i'm familiar with stupid people and diffusing most situations.  the ~~female~~ woman working this night asked me to keep an eye on things.  no problem.

so guy a phones a friend (guy c) to which i was unaware of.  guy b decides it is time to leave, and wouldn't you know it, guy a does as well.  these two knuckleheads start bickering in the parking lot and start doing the thing where each one is waiting for the other to throw a punch, which in the past was a good time to squeeze in and get everyone to their cab, uber, or whatever.

as i started getting involved guy c pulls up and sees me in his buddy's face.  he parks his car and b-lined straight to me, shoving me from behind causing me to fall real hard.  whatever i thought, i've fallen before, things quieted down and everything was fine.

"for using the money i won in a lottery to finance my own dream vacation across europe/asia besides on my kid's student loan debt?. on my birthday this year, i treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. after taxes, i had ~$34,000, so i've put $7,500 into my wife's car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. i'm planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, i plan to travel for the month of january and half of february across asia and europe. i've never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to disney world for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.

well yesterday my daughter emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. i told her about how i'm financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and emily went quiet before saying ""instead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt"".

i told her that i'd be happy to co-sign loans for her, but i was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount i promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). she said even after paying that off, she's looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. 

i told her that really sucks, but reminded her that i offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn't want to ""miss out on the prestige"" (she got into dartmouth). i talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.

she's brought up how the 10k i gave jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. she argued how it's not fair that i was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.

i told her that he'd be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. ultimately, the line i drew was that both children get equal amounts and i can choose how i want to spend my money, end of discussion.

i thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife amy about it behind my back. amy tried to ""persuade"" me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months i had planned. i told her the same thing that i told our daughter, and then she then got mad and said that i'm being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount i put into *her* car and the fact that she used all of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). i told her this vacation was non-negotiable.

now i have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. i feel like they're both acting entitled to my shit; am i really being unreasonable here?

"by bleeding all over my crush's car seat. i've been getting to know this rad guy through a good friend of mine who's visiting from another state. he's witty and has the meanest sense of humor, which i love. although we don't know each other well yet, we've poked fun of each other so much already. it's honestly refreshing to me that i can feel comfortable joking with him. 

but anyway, the three of us started hanging out a lot over the past few weeks, and tonight we threw a beach bonfire bbq since our friend goes back home soon. 

rewind to earlier today, i had a feeling my time of the month was approaching. i can feel my body adjusting to it but my app says it won't arrive til the following week. no sweat. i put on cute shorts and a cute top under a flannel. cute boy comes to pick me up and we drive. i felt weird below my waist already but i decided to ignore it. 

we get to the beach and set up the pit. it was fun, and he sat beside me the whole time. now at this point i can feel that something is happening downstairs, but i wasn't sure if it was because the sand was just a bit damp and because it was chilly and humid tonight, or if blood is gushing from my nether regions and i'm just pretending it isn't happening.

a few hours after midnight, we decide to call it a night and pack up. the weird wet feeling was even more pronounced but it's late, i'm tired, and i just want to go home at this point. he decides to drop our other friend off home first since i live farther, and i was pretty excited since this meant we'd have more time
to talk. around friends, he would always try to push my buttons. but alone, we'd have really great conversations, which we did during the drive home. i was stoked.

so he dropped me off and i went to my room, forgetting about the weird feeling  i had... until i got ready for bed and took off my clothes, only to find my shorts and underwear soaked in blood. i was mortified—it wasn't just a tiny stain. if i rung that sucker, oh it would drip, alright. 

then i remembered that i sat in his passenger's seat and proceeded to panic. if blood soaked through my shorts, there is no way that seat has no stain. 

i texted him shyly about it but he hasn't responded yet. i see him tomorrow morning though and i'm terrified of what he would say to me once he realizes what happened. well, so much for a good night.

tl;dr: period came early. bled through my shorts and possibly all over my crush's passenger seat while he was driving me home. will probably get made fun of by him tomorrow. 

edit: can't believe this blew up!!!! haha thanks for sharing all your stories and comments. just to give more detail since i'm more awake now: we went to a beach in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night so it was completely dark and there were no bathrooms. i couldn't have done anything, i think. also i'm a grown woman and well-aware of my body but oh well, accidents do happen. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

also i saw him this morning and he was totally chill about it. said he has a sister so he understands. he didn't tell me if there was a stain or not—he just kept telling me not to worry hahaha. either way, what a relief! 

edit 2: geez, some of you make it seem like a girl can't have a bad day. i've been irregular in the past year so although i had a feeling it was coming soon, i didn't think it would arrive within the next hour. that's unusual for me. chill out, reddit. i know the app isn't 100% accurate. not an idiot. just a girl who got caught in bad timing. peace!

"i broke up with my self harming, suicidal girlfriend because i couldn't take it any more. (tl;dr at bottom). conflicted
i am just a sophmore in high school. i was dating a senior in high school, one who i met last year and had an almost ten month long relationship with. it was a great relationship. we never had a real fight. any disagreements we had we would talk calmly about and rationalize together. it was a great relationship, but there were a lot of problems with most of them centering around her. i will go into these problems to try and justify to you, and myself as to why i broke up with her. 

**she has zero self control.**
she has lots of body image problems. she wasn't obese, even by medical standards, but she still had lots of loose fat. she didn't like this, but instead dieting, exercising, or simply just reducing the amount of candy she ate, she instead turned to purging and randomly refusing to eat for days at a time, before binge eating again. 
she could not, or would not try and stop herself from purging. she gave into all of her desires and would not stop herself. i would need to physically hold her back in order to stop her from running into the bathroom and forcing herself to vomit. 

**she would self harm on occasion.**
she would not stop herself, she wouldn't even try, no matter how many of her friends told her not to, tried to help her, or tried to help her find other ways of coping. she would always turn the razor onto her arms whenever she started having a mental break down. 

**she couldn't find happiness on her own.**
she would not find hobbies to do. she would not go out of her way to try and make her day better, she would rely on other people (e.g. me) to make her day better for her. 

**she needs lots of attention, and i mean lots.**
this past week was finals week so i spent a lot of time studying or working on personal hobbies in order to clear my head. i had to put my phone in another room in order to stay away from reddit and be more on task.
this was a problem for her because i was not texting her enough, which led to her feeling like our relationship was falling apart and that she needed other people to fill her attention gap. this led to her cheating on me. 
she was also texting multiple guys other than me, essentially all the time. 
i don't text any other girls at all. i'm nothing more than casual class friends with other girls. if i texted with any other girls to the same extent that she texts 2+ other guys, she would have instantly become jealous and angry. 

**she's a flirt.**
she cheated on me by kissing another dude. she put herself into a position where she was alone with another guy in a car and made him think that it was a good idea to lean over and kiss her. she then went back and kissed him five more times. 
i know this because she told me about it earlier in the week and had a self hating mental break down, cutting her arm 30+ times, purging repeatedly, and crying all night. she promised never to cheat on me again. i believed her, for all of like three days. 

**despite all of this, i loved and helped her.**
i would comfort her while she cried. i would tell her that mistakes that she made were just mistakes and that they weren't the end of the world and just to not do it again. i never held this against her, even though i really, really wanted to. 

#this all came to a head yesterday, a few hours before we went to an expensive restaurant for our 10 month anniversary.

we are laying down on her bed and watching kitchen nightmares together when she received a text from a guy saying something like this 
""hey, earlier when we were at (location), i almost leaned over and kissed you."" 
i read this over her shoulder, she glances at me, covers her phone slightly, and starts to type. i say ""ew gross, no. you have a boyfriend."" 
she responds to this text message with ""oooo"" 
not ""no."" not ""i have a boyfriend."" not ""sorry i'm taken."" 
but ""oooo."" 
if you don't know enough about social trends between texting teens ""ooooo"" leads someone on. 

i confront her about this on the spot, but she says that she doesn't want to talk about it and doesn't ""need this in my life right now."" 

i then start texting my trans friend about it. i practically trust this guy with my life. i've known him for years and helped him break through an addiction to pain meds in 8th grade. i need someone to talk to about this. 

she then gets very angry about me telling one of my friends, so we get into a calm, verbal argument about it and i ask her how she would feel if i were getting texts like that and i were leading people on. 
she continues to say ""i don't want to talk about this."" 
i then text my mom that i want to get picked up from her house because i don't want to be there anymore. i tell her i need some time to think about things and she gets angry and says ""why don't we just end it right now then?"" 
i say that i don't want to break up, but i also don't want to date someone who leads on other guys. she protests by saying ""it's just who i am, i'm a flirt! i can't change that."" 

at this point i'd practically had it. i've been extremely patient with all of her problems, but at this point it's really starting to affect me now. i don't want to date someone who openly cheats on me then turns around and refuses to fix herself. 
i break up with her and then leave her to cry in her room as i go find her mom, inform her of what just happened, and ask her to watch her tonight so that she doesn't self harm again. 

after a few minutes of listening to her sobbing uncontrollably and saying things like ""i can't do it anymore"" and ""my depression went away with you, it's going to come back. i can't handle it coming back!"" my mom pulls up and i leave.

#my justification.
this wasn't a healthy relationship. she was dependent on me for her happiness. she was dependent upon me and her friends for her to not self harm. 
she placed huge expectations on me as a boyfriend. we would see each other for 5+ hours every weekend, 3 times a day at school, and occasionally hang out on weekdays. even then, she felt like she wasn't seeing me enough. 

she couldn't help herself at all. even though she knew that this relationship was very good for her, she jeopardized it by cheating on me, promising not to cheat, then turning around and leading on other guys only days later. 

i understand that a lot of the problems she faced are hard. self harming, bulimia, and body image issues are not easy things to overcome, but she never even seemed to try to overcome them. she was completely dependent on others to try and stop her. 

i struggle with self harming on occasion because my extreme anger issues lead to me striking out at myself, usually by punching myself in the head. but i'm getting over it. i'm dealing with it and working through my problems. she won't. 

i have mild body image problems because i was medically overweight, just on the cusp of obesity. but i've lost 25 pounds. i'm working on it. 

i find happiness in the hobbies that i pursue. i play piano, i write stories for fun, and i sing in choir at our school. she refused to ever try and find choir to be fun, instead seeing it as a drain on her life. 

i no longer want this girl to be dragging me down. i don't want to have to deal with someone who requires constant attention, constant support, and demands huge portions of my time. it's mentally and emotionally taxing on me to try and prop her up all the time. i broke up with her for myself. 

i have some regrets. even though there were flaws, what we had going was pretty good. she loved me and i loved her greatly, but it just wasn't working out for me. she may cut herself because of me. she may purge because of me. she may be depressed for the next couple of months because of me.

but that's her choice. she is the master of her own life and her own decisions. i am the master of mine. i choose to go a separate way. 

#tl;dr: i broke up with my suicidal, self harming, bulimic girlfriend because it was too emotionally taxing on me. 

edit: we've talked a bit since then and i think she's handling it fairly well. she's not calling for me back yet (but it's only been <24 h so we'll see). her therapist is making her go to a kind of intensive therapy again, which should be good because she won't be able to harm herself there. 

she tried to get me back once by asking ""if i would have said no would we still be together"" which the answer is yes, but only for a little while. she needs to fix a lot of her problems before i would consider getting back together with her. 

also, she texted the guy who said ""i almost kissed you"" and blamed our breakup on him, saying that he ruined it. that's not really true. he was just a horny teenager who wanted to get into a curvy girl's pants. yeah she's taken, but ultimately it is her fault for leading him on and showing so much interest in him, then failing to deny him when he pushed it further. 

i wish i knew who he was so i could explain things to him, but i sadly don't. 

edit 2: thanks for all the support. as the post gets more popular, i won't be able to reach everyone. 

edit 3: i am do not plan on getting back together with her until i get into college *and* she fixes the problems that she is currently dealing with. until then i'll stay away from her apart from the casual wave in the hallways. ",11

"for refusing to feel my pregnant wife's belly kicks?. my wife is five months pregnant with our first child. recently, she has felt some small kicks from the baby. i tried to feel for a few nights, but no kicking. then on saturday, my best friend was over playing games with the two of us. we started talking baby stuff, and my wife mentioned that the baby has started kicking. my friend, who was very happy and excited, asked if he could feel her belly, and she said, ""no, but i appreciate you asking."" my friend was visibly upset/discouraged, but we moved on. my friend slept over after having a few drinks, but after he left the next morning, my wife and i talked about it and i told her that i was upset that she didn't let my friend feel her belly. she said that it was her body and she didn't want anyone but her mom or me touching her belly. so i told her that i will not be touching her belly and that that was my choice and i thought she was being unfair to not let my friend (30 and single) experience that life growing inside of her. she cried a lot and we talked a lot more, but it just seems selfish to me. am i the asshole here?
tldr: wife didn't let my friend feel her pregnant belly, so i decided that i would not be feeling her pregnant belly.

update : looks like i am an asshole. i'm at work and texted her that i'm excited to feel our baby and that i'm sorry for being an asshole.

update 2: while i completely do understand that i was being immature and petty, many people are calling my friend a perv. i think it's a very normal desire to want to feel a baby kick in the womb? also, all clothes were on. at no point did he ask to feel her bare belly. 
i now understand that i have no say in who is allowed to touch her belly and who is not allowed.

update 3: not sure if it is at all relevant, but my wife went back home for the week (before any of this happened) and my sister was the first person to feel baby's kicks, after my wife invited her to feel. my wife and i hadn't had the conversation of who is allowed to feel and who is not allowed to feel, so i figured if my sister was allowed, then our friend would be allowed. i shouldn't have assumed, but that was my line of thinking.

update 4: just got home from work, got her a big bouquet of flowers and sat down and hugged her and tried to feel baby. we talked about it and i texted her the link to the post. i told her i was stupid and that i fucked up big time and that i was very sorry. she accepted my apology and she's getting ready for work while i make her breakfast.

final update : i did hear you all loud and clear. fuck me, yes i'm the asshole here. to be honest, i was very excited that our friend was excited for us. i was then just discouraged that it seemed like he was being stifled. but my wife felt uncomfortable. that's that. end of story. i should've been fully supportive of her wishes in this situation and i wasn't. we're 4 years into a very young relationship (i'm 22, she's 21). i know that i have a ton of growing to do and i get that i fucked up here. i'm trying my best and sometimes my best sucks ass. i'm trying to be excited for this baby (i'm mainly terrified), and i fucked up. thank you for showing me what needed to change.",3

"update: for not wanting to be the maid of honor at my best friends wedding...pregnant and marrying my ex. i drove 7 hours to talk it out with her.. i got so many nice comments on my original, and my first ever gold,  i figured i owed everyone an update and sort of what i'm thinking now after getting a chance to talk it out with tammy and see gregory for the first time in almost 2 years. i needed the original is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/aneyb5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_the_maid_of_honor_at/


i posted the original on tuesday morning. i pretty much couldn't focus on anything else so i took the rest of the week off to have a self pity party. that wasn't working so i just decided screw it, i'm going to drive 7 hours to see tammy and just tell her how i was feeling. i texted her on the way and she said she was happy i was coming. i really wanted to address all the very good questions you good people had brought up in my post from tuesday. 

so i got there and we basically hugged hello and i have to admit i was very happy to see her. what was so fucking weird is it was obvious gregory was living in her place now. i don't even know why i hadn't even thought about this but he's a pretty messy dude so when i saw cereal bowls on the coffee table and socks on the floor (shit that used to drive me up the wall)...i was like wow...this is real. thank god greg wasn't there and tammy apologized that she just didn't feel good enough to clean up before she heard i was coming. 

so our conversation basically centered around what happened and why she never told me. at first she was kind of talking around it to spare my feelings and i got sort of frustrated with her and told her to please just tell me what happened. so it turns out they went out as a group right after i gave her greg's number and they just had an immediate attraction. they said that for the first few times they hung out it was all just reminiscing about our college days and never mentioned the attraction. i guess about two weeks of hanging out they kissed for the first time and she was so pissed at herself she blocked his number and didn't see him for almost a month. i guess she got lonely again, they ran into each other and admitted they had real feelings. she said she texted me and told me she wanted to talk about it right after they agreed to start dating (i found this out on my own on tuesday after going through my texts, but since i was so busy i wasn't very nice to her) but she knew i was busy and really wavered on interrupting the most important time in my professional career vs telling me some very hard to swallow news. she said rightly or wrongly she decided to tell me in person when she saw me again. fast forward a little bit i guess they so serious they talked about eloping after only two months and were pretty much living together. she said they had a drunken new years even party and just weren't careful and that's when she assumes she got pregnant. she said she knew then that it was an in person conversation she had to have with me, her first free weekend was last weekend. 


so i basically responded to all of this by saying i just didn't know how to feel. that in my brain i knew gregory and i were not compatible but my heart always hoped we'd grow up and be able to make it work and she was my best friend and i basically hooked them up. and i just don't know how to deal with all this. i know it's over but even seeing his shit on her floor was sort of painful (honestly, that would have been a massive fight between greg and i, like i said tammy is much more chill). i told her that i would always love her and always be her friend but an april wedding is probably just too soon to be involved in a wedding party. she said she totally understood. 


we talked about the elephant in the room for maybe 20 more minutes but honestly we were just talking in circles, saying the same thing over and over again. so we just sort of moved on to how she was feeling, how work was going, me apparently wearing some sort of man repellent because i can't even hook up on tinder  and all the other things friends usually talk about.  tammy is in full blown morning sickness so she must have barfed 15 times in the first two hours of me being there. at first i just let her do her thing...but then i felt really bad because we've been friends for over 20 years and i'm not even helping her. so i went in and helped put her hair in a pony tail and rubbed her back. and that's when it hit me that i would absolutely regret it and never be able to forgive myself if i weren't there for her wedding, pregnancy and having a baby...no matter who she was marrying. 


we went to lunch and at that point i told her i was sorry i was being selfish and i would be her maid of honor. she said no way i was being selfish but would never have another maid of honor besides me. it's not going to be the easiest thing in my life but i can't not do it. 


so we went back to her apartment and gregory was home. suddenly i felt like such an idiot because i couldn't possibly be in their wedding, let alone ever be around the two of them together. that was the most awkward hello i've ever had in my life (and thank god he'd cleaned up because i was just amped up with nerves to scream at him like i would have in the past). we sort of awkwardly sat on their couch not saying much but after a few minutes i just started telling myself again to grow up, don't let my own feelings get in the way of two people who may really belong together. 


seeing them in person together is even more saccharine sweet than i thought possible. they are perfect for each other. gregory is supportive (i don't know how many times i had to claim best friend privilege when she got sick over loving fiance privilege) and sweet and she's far more tolerant of him than i could ever possibly be. it was still hard for the rest of the evening but i think it will get better with time. i decided again i would be in heir wedding. 

we had dinner and i got a hotel because even though i'm trying, i'm not ready to sleep in the same house as them. tammy has to work today so i'm just hanging out before i see her for lunch than i'm going to drive back home.  we have a long, long way to go but i'm so glad i came to see her because at the very least we saw each other and talked it out and i'm very happy that i'm going to be involved in these major life events with her. 


thank you so much for all the input the other day and thank you for reading all this. 

tl;dr: my best friend is pregnant and marrying my ex boyfriend. she told me on sunday, i had an post that blew up on tuesday and i travelled to see her yesterday to hash it out. things are uncomfortable but she is and will always be my best friend and i've decided i'm going to be in her wedding. 


edit: guys holy shit! this has blown up again. i literally just got home and have over 200
inbox notifications. thank you so much for the gold and silver. i can't waif to read all this! thank you so much!


edit 2: i totally passed out last night so i didn't get to participate like i would have. i have to jump in and defend tammy, maybe no one will see this because it's probably time this fades. maybe no one will belive me but for all the critisms of her there's a good explanation that can most likely be explained away by me being a bad writer or not wanting this to be a narcissistic novel. for example, i saw someone saying ""tammy should have called after the first kiss."" i've known her for so long to know that she knows i can be very irrational and angry (i alluded to it in the other post but i had to do a year of anger management therapy because i can be like dynamite when i get pissed, i'm way better now but she probably has legit ptsd from some of my freak outs) and she figured it was a one time thing so why poke the bear if that makes sense. 

secondly, i can't stress enough how busy i was last fall. not an exaggeration to say i was working 16+ hours a day with maybe a day off every 20-30 days. i was planning a huge event that centered around a true narcissist and he would have me on my phone, texting questions and answers all day long. the last thing i wanted to do in my time off was get on my phone. i can count from that period and i'd say it averages 10 to 1 of tammy texting me (i assume calls were worse) but one stretch i think i counted she texted me 40 times before i texted her back. it's bad timing more than anything because anyone of those may have been when she wanted to tell me. and i definitely appreciate her thoughtfulness of not wanting to spring it on me while i was losing my mind from lack of sleep at work. i agree with her that this was an in person conversation anyways. 

i know tammy is just an internet sprite to all but one of you (and that is so f-ing tworedditorsonecup thing, i wish i had the energy to do another post) but she is a real person who has been my ride or die since we were 10 and 11. we've fought, screwed each other over so many times and we've always forgiven each other because having her in my life is way more important than pining over a guy i spent most of my time frustrated with anyways. don't get me wrong, i'm still pining and i cried last night over this...but like so many people said, maybe tam-tam's best gift to me as a friend was forcing me to get on with shit...maybe 10 years and 40+ breakups and just as many  broken dishes and slammed doors...she was the sign the universe sent to make me move on from a guy who wasn't right for me.

"for refusing to adopt my sil's child unless i'm the only one called ""mom""?. ok, backstory. my (27f) husband's (29m) older sister (36f) had a child when she was 19 from a one night stand. he was adopted by a nice couple a couple states over in an open adoption. they will send her pictures, are friends on facebook and occasionally have little get togethers. he calls her ""mama t"", as her name starts with a t. although she does not celebrate mother's day with him, she asks those around her to wish her a happy mother's day and becomes depressed when she is not acknowledged. she is very active in birth mother groups and speaks annually at a camp on birth mother's trauma and issues. she is unmarried and has always desperately wanted to have a family and children.

also for reasons that are not relevant (medical), my husband and i have decided adoption is the best idea as we cannot/will not have a biological child together naturally.

about 6 months ago, t announced that she is pregnant again. she told us she wants to have the baby but, once again, is not in a financial position to keep the child. so she's looking for adoptive families. our families all know that we have been looking to adopt and so she came to us about possibly adopting her child.

my husband thinks it would be a good idea. the timing is right and his sister is a ""known quantity"", as he put it. ie we know she isn't doing drugs or drinking. i'm not opposed, but i had some concerns. for one thing, i don't want my child calling anyone else ""mom"". we also live 45 minutes away, and from the way she acts from her first child's birthday and mother's day, i'm not sure it would be healthy for anyone involved.

after discussions, last weekend we went to t and told her we would be willing to adopt her child. she and my mil were thrilled, as the only other prospective birth parents she had spoken to were 2000 miles away. until i told t that she would be aunt t, not mama t. she freaked on me. told me that i was trying to erase her role as birth mother from the child's life. i told her that the child would be very aware they were adopted and that t was their birth mother, but they would not be referring to her or treating her as a mother. she burst into tears and said i was trying to take her baby from her. i told her that, if we adopted it, it wouldn't be her baby anymore. that... didn't go over well.

my mil has decided to stay out of this issue as much as possible. the entire rest of the family, who lives nearer to them, has been telling me that i'm being heartless and selfish and taking out my misery of being unwilling (they all know i'm capable) to bear children on her. my husband supports me in front of them. he has said that if we aren't united then we won't do it, but has also privately expressed to me how nice it would be to have a child genetically related to him. i guess he didn't realize how strongly he felt about passing on his genes until the option was back on the table?

"by making my boyfriend call me a cum dumpster. to address the elephant in the room straight away; i'm a very submissive person and one of my ""things"" is being called names. the guy that i'm dating is also into calling me humiliating names so it kinda works out. however, he is very, very careful when doing it, for reasons that will become pretty clear soon.

&#x200b;

despite loving the name calling as well, my boyfriend has always been way more careful about it. he tries not to go overboard and is very conscious about where he does it and how far he goes. by my own fault, i started to push him more and more and basically made him start calling me a ""cum dumpster"". he always tried to avoid the more vivid names but i guess after me pestering him, he broke and started using it. for the past month or so, i don't think he's said my name once; cum dumpster basically became my nickname.

&#x200b;

to add fuel to the fire, because i'm basically the queen of doing something until it goes very, very wrong; i pushed my boyfriend into us recording a short voice message for me to use as my alarm. instantly, because he knows me, he told me that eventually i'll forget to disable an alarm and it'll go off in public and it'll be very interesting to say the least. i should've trusted him because apparently he knows me better than i know myself-- but i have a way of getting my way of things so he agreed and we recorded like a 15 second voice message.

&#x200b;

i don't want to give you a play-by-play of the message but it's basically him telling me that i'm stupid cum dumpster and me agreeing in a very... sexual tone that i am in fact a stupid cum dumpster. lovely, i know.

&#x200b;

and here's the my boyfriend warned me about; and the obligatory it didn't happen today, it actually happened yesterday.

&#x200b;

i had a pretty big presentation at college yesterday that i've been working very hard on for the past six months. it's very important to me and i wanted to nail it; i don't think i've been more prepared to do something, i was ready. it was also a huge deal. multiple professors would be present and around 200 students were sure to show up. i know you have an idea of where this is going but trust me it gets better.

&#x200b;

the day of the presentation comes, four students were supposed to present their project-- i was one of them. our main professor comes to us and tells us that a few representatives of companies interested in our projects are also here to observe and assess. i was extremely excited because, as i said, i actually came very prepared; i even fought tooth and nail to go first. i was going to go first, steal the spotlight and put this in the bag.

&#x200b;

i start my presentation and i'm killing it. i'm concise, i sound professional, everything is on point-- until my alarm goes off. my first mistake was not making sure my phone is on silent or hell, even turned off. my second mistake was putting my phone right next to the microphones on the stand. why do i even have an alarm on when it's 1 pm? i've no clue; i don't even remember putting an alarm, i woke up at like 6 am that morning-- i was so excited for the day, i beat my alarm by 2 hours.

&#x200b;

my alarm goes off and everyone is either laughing or in awe of my stupidity. i was so shocked by myself it took like one loop of the alarm going off before i even turned it off. i fumbled my phone three times in the process. if i managed to turn it off before the part of me agreeing i'm a stupid cum dumpster; i would've played it off as if someone played a prank on me; but nah, the whole thing rang out on full blast.

&#x200b;

i apologize and try to play it off cool and rebound as soon as possible but there was some laughter still. i was so shocked by how idiotic i can be that i completely forgot to be embarrassed about it until my presentation was done.

&#x200b;

thankfully, my project overshadowed the others by a mile and my professors laughed it off afterwards and even some of the representatives took it in good gesture telling me not to worry about it, they care more about the project than my personal life. which was embarrassing in and of itself.

&#x200b;

to make things kinda more embarrassing, i think the whole campus now knows me as cum dumpster and that's literally my actual nickname now.

&#x200b;

i tell my boyfriend about it, he kinda gauged the situation a bit to see if i want to die or not; but he proceeded to laugh his ass off telling me ""i told you so"". he said we'll need to find a new nickname, though, because the whole campus is probably going to call me cum dumpster now and according to him ""good for you, tori!"". i don't think he'll ever stop teasing me about this.

&#x200b;

so yeah, i fucked up by making my boyfriend call me a cum dumpster.

&#x200b;

"for not allowing my son to come back to my house after he called his mom to come get him?. my ex-wife and i divorced almost two years ago and don't co-parent great-mostly just try to ignore one another unless necessary for us to interact (not mature, i know, but my attempts to change that were not met kindly). we have three children together and the youngest, evan (8), has been struggling the most with the divorce. the past few months he's been having meltdowns when he doesn't get his way- if we go to a restaurant he likes but that one of his brothers picked, or if he is made to clean his room instead of playing video games. he will yell that we're all mean, he doesn't like us and call his mom to come get him. she does, and then an hour or so later he gets dropped back off. i've asked her to not come get him, that it's my parenting time and he has to learn that he can't run away whenever he doesn't get his way, but she basically told me to f- off.

so i picked the kids up friday and told evan that if he called his mom to come get him that he had to stay with her all weekend and i would see him again the next day i had custody (i have him two days a week and three weekends a month). he got mad saturday morning over multiple things and called his mom to come get him. when she showed up, i reiterated the new rule to him and told her that if she took him she was keeping him all weekend. she basically blew me off and they left. a couple hours later when i was out with the other two, she called to see where i was because evan had cooled down and was ready to come back and she had ""things to do."" i reminded her that i told both of them if he left that he was with her all weekend. she blew up my phone all day angry because she had plans and couldn't find a sitter, evan called upset a couple times but i held my ground. he called sunday and was apologetic and asked if he could come to church with us and i told him yes and kept him the rest of the day and he was much better behaved. my ex says i am an asshole, which i'm used to, but then when i told my mom and sister, they also said i was too harsh and should've let him come back saturday and i find a different way to handle the behavior issues. i was feeling pretty proud of myself until i talked to them. should i drop this new rule or just ignore their opinion?

&#x200b;

update: wow, thanks for all the responses. i got a lot of really good advise and things to think about. i have made an appointment with my attorney to discuss getting evan into therapy that she can not interfere with and also to find out my best course of action for when/if she shows up in the future. wanted to jump on and answer a couple questions, though. a lot of people asked how evan was contacting his mom- she got him a phone for christmas. he is not supposed to bring it to my house bc i once took it away when he and his brothers were bickering all day (they all go their phones taken away). evan told his mom and she told me i had no right to take his phone away since she paid for it. so i told her that the phone stays at her house when he is with me but half the time he hides it and i don't know he has it. he will also call/text her by getting one of his brother's phones. once he even went in my office and facetimed her on my ipad. i usually don't know he's doing this because the things he decides he is going to call her about are random and often benign. once, he called her because he didn't want to go to lowes. he whined about going, i told him he couldn't stay home by  himself so he had to go and proceeded to finish cleaning up the kitchen. less than 10 minutes later and his mom is at the door to get him. he hadn't thrown a tantrum or anything-just normal whining that my other boys did at that age. later that afternoon when all the boring errands were done and i was about to take the older boys to a movie he got dropped back off. mostly when he calls her he is not emotional and crying- he just isn't getting his way and is frustrated. the older two got the same way at his age (heck they get frustrated now if they are told no) but they didn't have the option at his age to have someone come get them so they go their way.",3

"for calling a girl a cockroach after she 'jokingly' throws it away?. my friend and his gf of a few months came by for dinner and drinks this weekend along with my fiance and a couple other mutual friends. at some point i took off my wedding and engagement rings so i can cook and get chicken all over my hands (salmonella is bad kids) without worrying about them. after we eat and dishes are placed in the sink i reach blindly for my rings  since i always put them in a specific notch in the counter and only feel one.

cue panic. i asked everyone if they've seen the wedding band anywhere or if it got knocked off the counter and it got to a point where i was on all fours on the ground hyperventilating while me and our friends searched.

i showed them all a picture of it in case and the gf goes ""oh that thing? i thought it was foil i threw it away!""

record scratch. dafuq? everyone was staring at her and i'm pretty sure my face was changing colors more rapidly than metal under a blowtorch. she starts giggling and points at the trash. the trash is about half full of food prep stuff and puppy pads because we have a disabled french bulldog that literally cant control his bowels so yeah. pads.

""what it was an honest mistake! you left it with the other food stuffs and i was just trying to help!""

i asked if she was serious and she shrugged and repeated that it was just a mistake and the ring would most likely be sitting on top of everything. cursory glance said nope. my saint so offers to dig it out and i was too furious to say anything so i just nodded and glared at her. my friend (the bf) helps him too and they do end up finding it after nearly puking from the dog doo. after they wash it off they place it on a towel to dry and the gf still kept saying that she accidentally mistook it for foil.

i turn to her and in a calmness that afterwards left me shaking and lightheaded said ""you need to leave now, before i crush your face because i accidentally mistook you for cockroach.""

my friend and her gasp and our other friends kinda stared at each other and back at me.

gf bursts into tears and storms out. my friend follows her after an angry glare at me. our other friends told me i took it too far and maybe she was just playing a prank etc. they even mentioned that it was because my wedding band was not that expensive it wouldn't have been a big deal if we lost it. my so asks them to leave too as i am about to lay the wrath of god into them.

so reddit, am i the asshole here? did i overreact?

**tldr friends gf throws my ring away ""accidentally"" so i tell her to gtfo before accidentally confusing her for a cockroach.**

**edit: lots of comments to muddle thru so i'll add one here.**

thank you to all the comments even the ones saying iata. i recognize that threatening violence was not okay and i regret that part but if i'm an asshole for comparing her to a disgusting pest i don't want to be right.

some clarity as well - she never apologized which is why i dont think it was accidental. she was chuckling and snorting while my so and her bf dug through dog shit and food peels. she knew she fucked up because she didn't make eye contact with me at all while they were doing it either. even her bf doesn't think it was accidental after i talked to him today, but that it was harmless and we didn't really lose the ring and i shouldn't have called her a cockroach.

the ring, although inexpensive is sparkly and does not look like foil. it was absolutely insulting that my friends thought it was a non issue that they thought that i can just buy a new one if i had actually lost it. i'll post a picture in a bit to clear up confusion.

edit 3: last edit for the night here are the rings put together: http://imgur.com/a/zqfkyr1(http://imgur.com/a/zqfkyr1)

thank you to everyone with different perspectives. i'll say it again, i shouldn't have threatened her, yes it was in the heat of the moment but her smug laughing face pushed me over the edge. not an excuse. maybe i'm biased to not think my ring separately looks like foil but really its seeming less and less of a mistake when you consider that putting foil in compost makes no sense. she could've tossed it in the other two bins but she put it in the one we told them only food scraps and biological wet trash goes into. like they've been to our house before. the bf is still going to be my friend since honestly i don't blame him for the things she chose to do. that's her agency. not my problem.

edit 4 final edit. (will be adding to this as i read through)

i have read through most-ish of the comments so i will try and answer multiples of questions here and also some clarifications.

1. *why are you wearing your wedding ring if you're just engaged?* \- my fiance and i went shopping for wedding bands together after he gave me the engagement ring. when we found one that remotely fits, we took it home and pried it open wide enough to fit the engagement ring, and i wanted to wear it already and he agreed.
2. i am also a girl, they were at my house.
3. *why is there poo in the kitchen trash?* \- we have 3 bins in the house. 2 of them are open air, one for recycling, the other for non-recycling. the poo pad + compost bin is metal and covered and double bagged. we've had our disabled dog for around 6 months and this is the method that has worked for us because it's a hassle to run outside with drippy poo pee pads 3-5 times a day.
4. i recognize iata for threatening violence. i do not feel bad about calling her a cockroach.
5. *why are you focusing your question on calling her a cockroach when you should be asking about the ""crushing her face"" deal?* \- at the time, and even now, our friends thought that the cockroach bit and telling her to leave was the bit that went too far.
6. *how do you know she did it on purpose?* \- she still hasn't apologized, even if it was accidental. she did not throw anything else away because i throw everything i don't need away as i cook. she has been to my house many times. she has seen my rings together on my finger often. **also, if she accidentally threw away some 'foil' she wouldn't have recognized that she did from seeing the picture.**
7. *but you found it so why are you still making a big deal about it?* \- if i didn't reach for my rings at the time and they left after dinner, we would have thrown away the bin and it would have been lost forever.
8. thank you to all the people that say my rings are beautiful.
9. i didn't even realize the title said ""it"" until this morning, sorry about that.
10. *why do they even know the value of the ring?* \- we found them separately on etsy and got both pieces for a bargain and bragged about it when we got them.
11. *what is the stone in the engagement ring? -* alexandrite. it changes color depending on ambient lighting.
12. we will be investing in a ring saucer to place my rings in when cooking to mitigate any future incidents.
13. *how long have you known these people? -* the gf has been around for 7-8 months and we have hung out many many times before and during my engagement. the bf has been a close friend for around 10 years and no, i am not cutting him out. the other 2 guests are acquaintances that i've known for about a year.

"i 22f can't get something my boyfriend 27m said out of my head. i apologize for my brevity, but we're on vacation right now, and this is the first time i've had to myself. basically, about two months ago, we had a conversation about cheating, because he constantly makes little quips about me being a wh\*re/sl\*t, joking that i'm going to cheat while away at school, and just annoying repetitive jokes like that. it came around to him saying that he thinks if he were to cheat, it wouldn't be a big deal because ""what you don't know can't hurt you."" i tried explaining that cheating even if done ""perfectly"" is still blatantly disrespectful because you're gambling your relationship and your future children's respect. i said some things before that, but that was the thing i said that finally got him to do the ""yes dear, i agree dear"" because he wanted to end the conversation.  the ""jokes"" haven't ended, even though i mention it weekly that it bothers me and is hurtful. and now every time he says it, there's the extra echo in my head of ""what you don't know can't hurt you."" i worry that if i bring this up, he'll start the ""please don't break up with me/i'll break up with you if you're not confident in our relationship"".

edit: we had to go to a dinner, thank you for all the replies. i'm reading everything now, and i'll try to reply when i can next.

edit 2: last night was pretty rough, especially trying to act fine. he kept asking if i was ok, so i'm not sure if he's onto me. this morning i woke up way too early so i had a chance to read replies a bit more and think. i realized just how much my life has changed since i met him. there are some good things, but they're all weirdly scheduled or something, like he rushed to do something nice every time a bad thing happened. i got to thinking about his father, and his father's father, and realized that they both brag about how they purposely found the most shy girls, and that women who speak their minds and aren't selfless (read: self debasing) enough, aren't wife material. 

i'm 99% sure, based on things he and his family have said and done, that he's always planned to do this; the isolating, the mean and hurtful words, the complete lack of positive or helpful sentiments, all to make it easier to do whatever he wanted. and i'm ashamed to say it worked. but not for long.

my plan is to pretend i never figured this out. then while i'm away at school, i'll make as many friends as possible. eventually i'll see about finding a part time job, but that will have to be done in secret. i'll put away as much money as i can and avoid spending any of my student loans or grants besides on school.

it's going to take me months to figure out a way out, but i have to. looking at his mother and grandmother, i can't be like that. that's the worst existence i can think of. working a full job, then coming home and working another full job cooking and cleaning while he sits around and lectures about how smart he is. the only thing that could possibly change in the future is adding babies.

thank you for all of your help. if i didn't have someone to turn to, i would have been strung along a lot longer, and the thought makes me cringe. ",7

"if you own a vehicle. please, be extremely mindful of your tire air pressures.. i worked in the automotive industry for over 5 years. i have encountered too many people whom are unaware of how important proper tire air pressure is. the tire pressure monitoring system (tpms) in your vehicle is an aid to this matter. it is only there to let you know about drastic differences in air pressure between your tires. we have to remember that the tires on our vehicles are what dictate how well we will be able to handle said vehicle. tires are what make contact with the road, thus should be the forefront of our safety priorities. rather not have to use your seatbelt because you were able to brake in time, than total your vehicle due to an over inflated tire.

yes, i said that correctly, over inflated. when we over inflate our tires, we decrease the surface area that makes contact with the road. in turn, reducing friction between the tire and road. this increases our distance to come to a stop, and how much under/over steer we experience. over inflated tires are also more suceptable to blow outs due to the already high pressure. over inflated tires suffer decreased life time, dangerous cracking, and decreased traction.

under inflated tires are just as dangerous. we are more attentive to a low pressure tire because they are more visible. severely under inflated tires can unseat from the bead, causing you to possibly lose control of your vehicle. pot holes and bumps on the road can possibly pinch the wall of a low pressure tire, causing you to lose said tire. decreased gas mileage is also an effect of under inflated tires. when a tire is under inflated, it does not have enough pressure to keep proper shape, thus ""folding"" under the vehicle when moving. this increase how much torque must be applied for said tires to rotate. 

most vehicles, on the drivers door jamb, have a tire pressure information sticker. if we follow those guidelines, we will all be safer on the roads. if you find your tires to be incorrectly inflated, once corrected, you will immediately feel the difference. gas mileage depends on how you drive but, your tires will always have an effect. please, be safe on the roads. we already have to deal with enough to have to go through something that could of been avoided by properly inflated tires.
lets all be safe on the roads!

"update ca how can i get my neighbors to get rid of their noisy chickens?. i posted this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3brffg/ca_how_can_i_get_my_neighbors_to_get_rid_of_their/) about three years ago, and it got very little attention, but some people did help and for that i was (and am) super grateful. plus, i figured we all like update posts, and this situation of chicken warfare is finally resolved. 

&#x200b;

to recap: my neighbors had five chickens that would squawk at ungodly hours of the morning and night. they were actually my parents neighbors; i was crashing with them over the summer and have since moved out. we did contact the city, who came and determined that they were up to code. but the neighbors assumed it was us (my parents had been pretty vocal in the neighborhood about not liking the chickens), and they decided to retaliate. 

&#x200b;

first, they claimed that a structure on my parents' property was illegal, and my parents had to deal with a city investigation, which turned up nothing, because it was not illegal. next, they claimed that our little patch of sidewalk front yard, which is right next to theirs, was actually infringing on their property and demanded a property survey. we actually discovered that their front garden was partially on our land, so that was nice. my mother e-mailed the neighbors letting them know they were going to put up a little line of stones just to keep the garden property line clear so that they could plant their side, and the neighbors went batshit. started sending long, rambling e-mails to my parents, started calling and hanging up, started throwing trash on our side of the garden and they eventually left several dead rodents still in traps on our front porch. after that, my parents got a security camera. 

&#x200b;

things quieted down for a while, and we soon found out it was because the neighbors were trying to sell the house. their house is pretty nice, and we live in a high col city in a neighborhood that has really gotten popular in the past \~10 years. basically, if all went well the neighbors would be making 2 or 3 million dollars from the sale. they hosted several open houses, and this is where my dad decided to get petty. see, my parents deck directly faced the neighbor's backyard, which still had the chicken coop and was one of the main attractions of the open house (they were actually trying to sell it as an ""urban farmhouse.""). as people would wander into the backyard of the open house, my dad would stand on his deck holding a very large sign that said, ""no chickens in this neighborhood."" the other side said, ""they bring rats and vermin into our lovely community."" i was half horrified, half cracking up. i told him that it would only escalate things, but he was insistent that any new neighbors not be allowed to keep the chickens. he would periodically shout down into the neighbors yard (our houses were very close), ""we will not allow new neighbors to keep chickens!""

&#x200b;

my parents got many furious calls and e-mails from the realtor and the neighbors. apparently my dad was making people hesitant to buy the home (i don't blame them, he was acting like a crazy person), offers were dwindling, and they were going to have to lower the price. my dad said he would stop his chicken protest if the coop was removed; the chickens stayed, so my dad stayed on his deck for every single open house. 

&#x200b;

to make a long story of chicken subterfuge short, the neighbors sold the house. on their last night in the house, they egged my parents entire backyard and deck. i asked my dad if he wanted to report it, and he said it would be better to be rid of them. a lovely family has since moved in, and the first thing they did was dismantle the coop. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr: petty neighborhood chicken drama results in fowl play, but new neighbors are eggcellent. ",2
"what can i do about my weirdo landlord?. hi! not planning to take legal action here yet but i lurk on this reddit sometimes and i am definitely curious about something! location: usa, pennsylvania

i just moved into a great new apartment last month. it's a house where the downstairs is my own apartment and the upstairs is the landlord's apartment. one important thing to know is that my kitchen is detached from my other rooms. i have to go through a common hallway to reach my kitchen, but it is my kitchen. only problem with the place  is that the landlord has been doing some weird stuff that makes me uncomfortable. 

i was going to try to skip over the socially weird stuff that he does and keep it to the stuff that i think could be illegal. but he's very creepy. he comes down and knocks on my door often, just to be like ""what are you doing today?"" this has happened once or twice a week the past few weeks. once he even called me. he was like ""i'm going to a party with some other property owners in the neighborhood, wanted to know if you would like to come too..."" which isn't that bad, but when i said no he started pressing me. he got kind of mad, started being like ""you know this is really disappointing to me, i thought maybe you'd want to support your new neighborhood etc"" i ended up hanging up on him. i don't want to be friends with my landlord. i hate the dynamic and he's also probably the same age as my grandparents. 

my apartment has three doors basically. but two of them are nailed shut and can't be used. it's an old house that was converted to be apartments. last week he came down and knocked on the main door. i didn't want to talk so i didn't answer. so then...he goes down and knocks on the second and third doors really hard, knowing those can't be used. i stayed quiet and just didn't answer. five minutes later i get an email. ""just knocked on your door to see what you're up to. thought i heard you down there but i guess not."" which once again, probably not illegal but really weird and really makes me not like him. he also tries to get me to help him with things in his apartment. like moving things around etc. i won't do it. not that i'm opposed to helping someone but he just makes me so uncomfortable that i don't feel good going up to his place. he asks several times a week if i can help him with a ""favor"" or ""chore"" upstairs. haven't said yes yet. 

so that gives an idea of what he's like. he is really bad at personal space. and so far it's rubbing me the wrong way. but last week he really did something that i feel is illegal. i was having some friends over for dinner in my kitchen. while we were eating he came down and just barged into my kitchen. he stood really close to one of my friends and was like ""i heard you having a party down here and wanted to introduce myself to your friends. i don't think i've met them before."" and then he did so. all of us were pretty freaked out. we were all sitting at the table and he was standing over us, right over the table, rocking back and forth. just kind of making small talk. trying to get to know my friends. he has come to my kitchen doorway before to say hello while he's walking through the hallway but has never come into my kitchen. i eventually got him to leave by just saying ""alright, bye""repeatedly and then i stood up and showed him to the door. my friends left immediately afterwards. one of them was kind of upset and just freaked out about the way he was being. i didn't know what to do. i was so mad. the next day i sent him an email, so that it could be documented in writing. i said basically, what you did last night is not okay. you are never allowed in my apartment without permission. i pay you rent for my place, you respect my privacy, etc. made it clear that it pissed me off and i wasn't okay with it. he tried to make me feel bad in his response and didn't really apologize. he was like ""well i heard there was company in my house and i wanted to introduce myself. i was just trying to be nice and social"" or something like that. tried to make it seem like he's this innocent lonely old man. doesn't seem to think that what he did was wrong! i don't buy it. keep in mind that he's been a landlord for a long time and has had many tenants and has to know how this stuff works. he's a creep. 

so what i'm wondering is...if he does something like this again is there legal action i can take? do landlords have to give a notice before coming into your apartment? i thought that was a thing. the reason i'm worried/wondering is because i haven't lived here but a few weeks and he's already pushed these personal boundaries very aggressively. if he continues down this path of invading my privacy, there's got to be something i can do, right?",2

"update: my 27m best friend's 27m girlfriend 40f just called me and invited me over without my friend there. so i just wanted to give an update and add some context to my last post.  i quickly wrote my last post because i was looking for answers before i arrived at the house.  the tl;dr of the update is that we had a pretty innocent conversation about life in general.

so like i said before, i've hung out with my best friend's girlfriend before but it's always been the three of us.  and shes called me or texted me before, but usually it's in the context of a group thing that me and my best friend are in the process of setting up.  so when i saw her name pop up on my phone as she called me, i knew that there weren't any plans (i just was with the both of them for game 7 of the nhl playoffs), and my immediate thought was that something bad had happened to my friend and that's why she was calling me.  so when i answered the call, that was my mindset going in and i was kind of a 'deer in the headlights.'

when i answered she asked me if i had any plans for the evening, i told her i didn't.  she asked if i wanted to come over for some pizza and beer, and hang out.  i had just got home from work, and told her that i just needed to change and i could come over.  at this point i thought all three of us would be there, but that's when she told me that my friend was still at work and wouldn't be back till later.  so to those of you asking why i would even go over in the first place, i was already pot committed.

now to those of you wondering, i did not text my friend that i was going over.  here's the thing.  i've known him since i was 5, so 22 out of the 27 years i've lived i've been friends with this kid.  we grew up together and he is basically my brother.  i knew what my intentions were, and trusted that he would trust me.  nonetheless, the girlfriend did let him know that i was coming over and so he texted me when i was on my way to his house.  he knew i was going to be there.  i also have a recording app on my phone that i had ready to use so i could turn it on if the conversation started going inappropriate, but i did not have to use it at all.

when i got there, all me and the girlfriend did was talk about life stuff until my friend came home.  i feel like if anything, this was just a little bonding time for the two of us and an opportunity to connect more.  my friend is an important person in both of our lives, so it makes sense to me that his girlfriend and i should also have a good, friendly relationship as well.

all in all, i think i just freaked out a little because it could definitely have been an awkward position if everyone's intentions weren't good.",7

i feel terrible and still haven't found a way to tell my sisters. from now on i'll always make sure. i hope this post pushes someone to look up the difference between the two before deciding to ""save"" their george. :(

"car delivery service left my vehicle flipped on its side blocking an entire lane of a major boulevard, marked it as ""delivered"" and left with my money before police could arrive. hey everyone, first time posting here. a few people advised that i turn to this community since my claim with the bbb is taking a while to resolve.

i am an automotive enthusiast. i have been working with my dad on project cars for over a decade. i recently saved up enough money and purchased a ""non-operational"" 1967 cadillac coupe deville (me & my dad's dream car). i wanted to check it out and surprise him with it once i got it up & running. the owner gave me a good deal as long as i tow it from alabama and do an inspection when it arrives in ga (it was about 2.5 hrs away).

company fails to call me upon pick-up. the seller's neighbors noticed the truck hauling the vehicle and texted him pics that he forwarded to me. this was at 7am. he notifies me, so i immediately call the carrier to confirm if they picked it up and when i can expect them to show up (it's a weekday so i needed to make sure i'm available). the carrier never picks up, i've been sitting around all morning & afternoon postponing my work, errands, and entire day because i don't want him to show up without me being present. just trying to get a vague idea of when to be on-site and ready to help.

after trying to reach several numbers 10-12 times, the 3rd party dispatcher finally made the carrier (towing company) driver call me back. it was around 7pm (entire day has passed) and tells me he'll be here in a few hours. my whole schedule has been dissolved at this point, but i figure ""fine"" as long as they get here.

fast forward a few hours. truck arrives, the main driver is very irritable, annoyed, treating and talking to me like it's my fault that it's dark & late after i've been waiting for him a full day without notice. turns out, him & his partner can not remove the car off the rails because they secured it in the wrong place. i was outside trying to offer them help for hours, calming the situation, consolidating, offering water & trying to strategize. i know as a client i don't ""have"" to, but it was a signature moment for me in buying this car, and i wanted to get it here safely. it was obvious that they were extremely incompetent but i gave them benefit of the doubt.

i went inside and let them do their work without bothering them. at this point it's 2am and the car hasn't moved. they were fed up, so one of them proceeded to push the car. he applied too much sideways force (to an already non-operational vehicle) and made it slip off the truck railing. at this point the car is sitting on one rail, whole weight on its oil pan which eventually cracks oil starts pouring out.

i run outside. immediately tell them to stop! like what are you doing?? i even said ""would you let this happen to a ferrari??""

the driver tells me ""i can't help you any further, get this car off my damn truck cause i gotta leave. if i have to, i'll sell it in alabama it to recoup the time i've lost here""

i was shocked & appalled. threatening to leave with my private property after he knowingly picked up a non-operational vehicle and couldn't fulfill delivery (damaging my property in the process) even though the contract is ""door to door delivery"" ""no risk guarantee, fully insured etc. all the shits & giggles.""

he gets in the truck and is about to leave. keep in mind i already paid $150 deposit to the 3rd party company that assigns the load location and carrier who wants to fulfill the shipment. i also had to give the driver $200 cash once he arrived before ""attempting"" to unload my car. i run up to him and say ""you can't leave with my property. stop right now!""

he proceeds to tell me i have to call a local atlanta 24/7 emergency line to come assess the situation because otherwise he's leaving with my car within an hour.

i call the first number that comes up on google and let him speak to the company. he hands me the phone back and says ""we're good, i'll wait"" at this point i'm done with this guy, so i go inside and let him do his thing. an hour later i see the local emergency service guy arrive. i stay inside & watch. i figure i'd just let them talk, assess the situation and finish everything while i wait for further notice.

fast forward 30 minutes, i run outside to check up on everything see my car flipped on its side like wtf??(https://imgur.com/a/frrm0). blocking an entire lane of traffic on a major downtown boulevard. broken roof, cracked oil pan, doors, mirrors, wheels, everything.

before i can even ask for my money back, since the car was technically never ""delivered"", the trucker storms off even before police could arrive. leaving the scene of a crime, or at minimum damaged property that he's liable to deliver safely. i had to spend another few hundred $$ on the tow truck service that the local pd called in order to get the car off it's side since it was impeding traffic. i filed a police report + 2 witnesses.

the cops were very helpful and sympathetic. we spent hours discussing the situation while they helped me get it on my property. at a certain point we all started laughing on how ridiculous this is(https://imgur.com/a/frrm0). they said they've never seen anything like this before. it was almost 8am at this point, i thanked the officers, at this point we all wanted to just go home & get some rest. i filed a complaint with the bbb the next morning.

it's just sad to me that people have to treat other humans this way. i don't owe you anything, i don't need to oversee or micromanage your incompetence. it's not my job to do so. i went through all this time to save up, research, and buy something special for my dad while trying to do something good. i didn't even have to be present. door to door delivery implies the drivers know what they are doing. i would have never imagined being treated like this, let alone if this was someone else like an elderly person who wouldn't be able to talk or deal with these guys' attitude at all. all i wanted was to get my property in one piece. i didn't have to endure this type of treatment.

anyways the officers told me this is a civil matter. i don't have a budget for an attorney, but local paralegal friends of mine told me this is a pretty solid case so i should seek some feedback. i wanted to turn to you guys for advice & see what i can do.

sorry for the long post/formatting. hopefully i can find some guidance.

thank you!",2

"by immaculate ejaculation. so this happened a month ago and it's one of the most embarrassing dating stories i have and it still haunts me and may haunt me forever.

&#x200b;

alright so first date with a girl off a dating app we're vibing pretty hard and there's some sexual flirtation and environmental foreshadowing (2 slugs at the table we were drinking at were humping) so i try to figure out delicately with words if we gonna bonk and she blushes and says 'next time' then gives me an irresistible look that confirms she isn't kidding about next time. butttt i'm in her town and the last train home for me is about 11pm. i suggest i leave to walk back to the train stations around 10:30, she convinces me to stay a bit longer and that she'll call me one of the local taxis to get me back to the station. alright every single taxi company she calls has no free cars and i realise i'm stuck 30 miles from home at midnight with a girl i just met who is profusely apologising and blaming herself. my horny immoral mind realises i can salvage something. i say i'll just get a hotel but on the way there she keeps apologising and ends up inviting me back to her place to make up for it.

i'm very aware she probably didn't want to have sex considering she said ""next time."" as we're standing in her room awkwardly avoiding the fact it was time to get into bed i'm forced to ask the awkward question - ""so do you sleep with all your clothes on or? i normally sleep in my underwear."" she told me to go ahead so i undressed and got into her bed before she got in - fully clothed. we cuddle for a bit then share a glance and my temptations begin to kick in. i thanked her for letting me stay even though it wasn't her original plan, but told her that i really wanted to kiss her. the kiss became making out, and she was very intense and touchy and i honestly couldn't tell what she wanted. it was driving me crazy so i thought i might as well try my chances, moved my hand slowly down her waist and of course she stopped me. ""not tonight."" she was an amazing kisser and i couldn't stop thinking about it all night.

so i lay there pressed up against her cuddling for 7 hours, unable to sleep the whole time, boner poking out of my underwear trying my hardest to make sure she doesn't notice. i am 100% sure i have never been hornier in my life. i was erect for at least 80% of the 7 hours and my balls started to viscously ache by hour 3. i feel like it's immoral to even say this but every time she readjusted her sleeping position and slightly brushed my crotch it was the sweetest torture. we were only spooning but her fully clothed body felt so good, every time i started falling asleep i realised my hands were wondering places they shouldn't, so i stopped trying to fall asleep altogether.

around 7am i can tell she's starting to wake up because she's moving her hands around my back etc. she opens her eyes and looks at me with a seductive smile that once again made me wonder what the fuck is going through her head. the body touching slowly gets more intense and i realised i had a genuine problem - it feels like i'm actually getting sexual pleasure from simple caressing. i've never had a problem with premature ejaculation but spending hours upon hours sharing a bed with a girl i just met, hornier than i'd ever been had made me hypersensitive. the problem is confirmed when her hand explores new territory and brushes the skin just below my belly button and i literally have to recoil backwards. ""what's wrong?"" she asks me. i decide to just come out and nervously say ""i've been laying here awake horny as fuck for 7 hours. and now you're all handsy."" she said she was horny too and wanted it but has a first date rule. i was about to say that's classy and respectable or something when she leans in and starts making out with me and grinding. the way she kissed i started to lose it and i realised there was no way i could have sex with her because i wouldn't last very long.

that was an understatement. she started to lift up my underwear strap with her fingers, about to delve deeper when it happened. nothing was currently touching my penis at the time. i ejaculated from being touched a few inches below my belly button. like really hard too. i couldn't hide it as i twitched about everywhere. she was obviously pretty surprised.

she seemed understanding and seemed heartfelt when she said she had a good time and wanted to see me again - but well she stopped replying and i guess i know why.

&#x200b;

tl;dr lay in bed with girl on first date horny as fuck and unable to sleep for 7 hours then when she changed her mind in the morning and got touchy i nut with no direct stimulation. this is one of the most embarrassing stories in my life and the fact it ruined what was a really nice date with a nice girl still fucks me up.

&#x200b;

edit: alright i don't know whether i like the fact that this post blew up but i kind of half knew as i shamefully walked out of her house that this would make a strong post and i guess i was right. i messaged her today asking her to be honest if she stopped responding because of the morning thing. she said it was because i didn't message her for a week then asked her if she wanted to come over. i messaged her the same day a few hours after i left thanking her for a nice time and that i was hoping to see her again. i figured if she wanted to talk she would start a convo and my approach to dating is don't be the person who always starts convos - and the fact she didn't start one gave me the idea that she wasn't much of a texter which is cool. apparently i was supposed to text her throughout the week. no way i could have known that and i don't see why it's on me to do that. she said the fact i asked her to come over offended her and that i thought she was easy. so yeah not my kinda girl anyway if she has those kinds of insecurities about sex and presumes that i know she wants to be texted a lot.",4
"disabled 29 y/o, heating bills out of control and rising. not sure what to do.. hello! 

a little about me: i'm 29 and was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder in my late teens. i was raised in a traditional ethnic community where women weren't encouraged to handle money; so i've spent the last two years essentially teaching myself to manage my finances while living independently for the first time. so far, things have been going ... okay. i've never been late on my bills and nothing has ever been shut off; but i could definitely serve to budget a bit better. money is extremely tight, though. 

i only get $750/mo and my rent alone is $425. i currently rent the lower half of a historic home on the outskirts of a major city.there's an apartment above me; but it's only been occupied since november. since then, my heating bills have been going up steadily. 

i had the gas&electric company come out to check the meter; but they said it was working fine after being replaced in april. next, my landlord sent out their hvac guy to check on the heater; but he said it was working fine. the only thing he found was that upstairs's hot water was going through my meter, so they agreed to pay 1/5th of my gas bill to cover it. he also told me to keep my heat on and set low instead of turning it off and on like i had been. 

for the past month, i've done what he said and kept my home heated around 60 degrees. it's been really bad and i'm always cold -- and in pain since the chill hurts my back and joints horribly. but i needed to save money, so i didn't give into the temptation to turn it up higher. 

i got my bill last night and it's worse than ever. it's almost $200, just in gas. i'm not sure what to do or where to go from here. i'm including a graph to show exactly how high it's jumped. 

any advice would be deeply, deeply appreciated. i cried myself to sleep about this last night because i'm so deeply worried. this feels like the first big financial crisis i've had since i've been independent and i don't know what to do next. it feels like i've exhausted my options and no one is listening. 

thank you for any help you guys throw my way.

ps: i should also note that my upstairs neighbors have also been receiving larger energy bills than average. they're equally confounded.

update -- 
thank you so, so much for all the help, pf! you guys an incredible. 

after reading through the thread, i spoke with my upstairs neighbor. we're in complete agreement that the landlord needs to come out here and weatherproof the house -- as well as getting the upstairs apartment's hot water on their own meter. we wrote a joint letter together and sent it off to our property management; so we should hear back soon! 

in the meantime, i'm going to try to seal the windows myself since the house is horribly drafty. 

i also called the gas company out today to investigate the place i was smelling gas; but they determined it was just a normal little bit that gets let off when my upstairs neighbor turns on his stove. they said it was safe; so i'm going to trust them. 

thank you to the multiple wonderful people who offered to get me heated blankets or food. that's very kind of you all and far too generous. lgbtqa+ shelters could use that kindness far more than me; especially during this time of year where a lot of teens end up on the street, cold and abandoned.
here's a way of finding some in your area, if you want to help!: https://www.lgbtcenters.org/lgbtcenters

and thank you again for all your help so far. i'm reading every comment and taking all the advice to heart. it means a lot to mean. i'll update you guys when i find out more!

second update -- 

i have yet to hear back from my landlord; but it usually takes them a few days to get in touch with the owners, so i'm not worried yet. i really cannot properly express just how much this thread has helped me. i'm still new to living on my own, managing my finances, and managing a household, in general. usually, i feel two steps behind everybody on this stuff and never feel like i know the right questions to ask. i can honestly say that, going forward, i know exactly what to say to my landlord and anyone he sends out. thank you for that, from the bottom of my heart.  

also, i wanted to let you guys know that the energy bill this month is entirely paid off thanks to the amazing generosity of some absolutely remarkable people. i also have a few other things headed my way to help me fend off the cold a bit better. i'm just astounded by the kindness in this community. but again, there's other people out there who need your help way, way more than i do -- so, please, if you have the means, consider donating to an lgbtqa+ shelter in your area. it makes more of a difference than you could ever know.

"by going skiing in an inflatable t. rex costume.. skiing in an inflatable t. rex costume(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iu9rp7pzwn0/maxresdefault.jpg) is a terrible idea. just fyi. unfortunately my dumb ass thought it might be fun, so when i went out on a family ski trip, i convinced my mom to buy one for my three siblings and i. 

for context, i'm the second oldest of four at 22-years-old. so this wasn't some dumbshit decision i made as a kid. this was adult-level stupidity and i deserved everything that happened from here on out. also, my younger brother and sister weren't terribly keen on the idea while my older sister was all for it. must be an age thing. 

so when we get out onto the slopes, we all zip ourselves up in our outfits which have to be airtight so those big, nutcracker t. rex heads on top can bobble about. they're inflated by tiny, high-powered fans inside the suit. the one issue i do have with the design of these fuckers is the little window where you're supposed to look out of. it's tiny, plastic, and shifts around like a drunken sailor. 

to exacerbate matters, i'm a 6'4"" guy and this thing was made for people slightly shorter than me. seeing out of it was no easy feat. even worse than that, the cold of the winter mountains combined with the heat of one's breath makes those little screens fog up like a motherfucker. 

after everyone rode the chairlift up and suited up at the top of the slopes, we were ready to go. the first ride down actually went quite smoothly, with each of us taking wide turns and going slow. we took an easy course to keep it simple and there were quite a few kids skiing alongside us by the time we reached the bottom. they loved it.

unfortunately, towards the end of the run, my younger brother's zipper came undone and his dino-head deflated, inevitably blinding him and causing him to come to an emergency halt before he rexed himself. that should've been a warning sign for me. these outfits were not meant to be skied in, but i was far too stupid to listen to such logic. 

when we finished our first run, my younger siblings were done. it'd been fun, but suffocating in a polyester coffin wasn't worth the novelty. 

that left my older sister and i to do our own thing. now as i said before, seeing out of these things was damned difficult. having already skied one run in them, my little window was fogging up bad and the lack of airflow left me sweating like a pig. but i was determined to go on another run. 

my sister and i hopped on the chairlift to take another ride up, this time leaving the heads up because the process of unzipping and tucking the costumes away was such a pain. here we are riding the chairlift.(https://i.imgur.com/0wejbtq.jpg) it was a bit awkward riding that way, but eventually, we made back to the top. 

this time around, we decided to go a bit faster to get back down and that was where everything literally went downhill. as i rode with my sister in tow and a couple kids following, my big, inflatable head blew back with the wind and the plastic window i was looking through suddenly rose several inches. a layer of sweat-smothered polyester rose over my face, flicking a nice pinch of salt into my eyes. that stung like a bitch. 

reflexively, i began pawing at my eyes to clear them and immediately forgot i was also skiing along like barney on meth. i don't remember the next few moments because my world had been reduced to billowing polyester, burning eyes, and the cries of alarm from the other kids as i twisted out of control. 

then i smacked full on into a chairlift pole. 

my sister told me it was nowhere near as dramatic as it felt. apparently, i resembled retarded velociraptor, sliding one way and then the other, with my giant t. rex head flapping about and cursing. she didn't have time to warn me about the chairlift pole i ended up running because she was laughing too hard. 

luckily the pole i smacked into had been wrapped in a foam pad,(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/hoodoo-ski-area-central-oregon-resort-big-green-machine-chair-lift.jpg) so i only bounced off it with enough force to have the wind knocked out of me. i'm pretty sure i ended up scarring a couple kids for life, but at the very least i didn't concuss myself in the most embarrassing manner possible. 

i ended up laying there for a couple moments before slowly righting myself up. my t. rex was demolished. he suffered a puncture that led to his deflation, so i rode the rest of the way down with his head flapping behind me in defeat. 

i will say the situation was made slightly better when a kid skied too close behind my sister and completely face-planted when they tripped on her tail. it helped a little, but from that day on i've made it my responsibility to warn others of the dangers of skiing in inflatable t. rex costumes. it's a rising epidemic in our country and deserves our utmost attention.

tl;dr - i went skiing in an inflatable t. rex costume without thinking it through. ended up getting blinded by the giant head and ran into a chair lift pole, nearly concussing myself. no one had sympathy for me or my dino.

"(ok) apartment complex that offers trash removal service is threatening to charge me $25 per bag of garbage (15 bags total) that are outside my door if i don't take it to the dumpster myself, but i moved out 5 weeks ago and it's not my trash.. this is a strange situation, so stick with me please. so my lease for this apartment ends july 31st. early in the spring, i decided i didn't want to renew as i wanted something cheaper. i found a house that worked better for me and the lease for that started june 1st, so i have two places in my name as of right now. i moved out of the apartment in the second week of june and i have been living in the house ever since, while still paying rent for the apartment to finish out the lease.

i get a call from the apartment complex today, saying they've received complaints of trash outside my apartment door (which is where we are supposed to leave our trash bags for the trash service to pick up and take to the dumpster). she said they have a photo of 15 bags of trash in the area near my front door where trash is supposed to be. she said that the trash service only takes away one bag of trash a day, and they are going to charge me $25 per bag of trash if i don't take it to the dumpster myself. 

i inform the woman that i moved out last month, and told her that they are welcome to enter the apartment to confirm i am no longer there, as it is 100% cleaned out. she told me that she will call my neighbor, who with the way the front doors are positioned, puts his trash bags in the same place as me. she said she will check with him and if he disputes it, they will go through the trash and it will be ""obvious who's it is"". 

the reason i am resisting taking it out myself, is that i live on the third floor of what i will call an outdoor apartment building, meaning that when i open my front door, i am outside (versus closed apartment buildings where you open your front door to an indoor hallway). it's been 100 degrees with humidity, i'm on the third floor, and even once i walk down the two flights of stairs to the bottom, i am a football field length away from the nearest dumpster. i am a girl, so i would only be able to handle two trash bags at a time, which would mean 8 trips up and down two flights of stairs, in the heat walking all the way across the complex in the sun.

i have a strong feeling my neighbor is going to dispute it, and they are going to believe him over me, as he is a 40 something year old doctor at the local hospital, and i am a mid twenties college student at the local university.

"when petting a dog that is overly submissive, pet/rub their chests not their heads. this will boost their confidence.. firstly you should never pet a scared dog, especially if you don't know it.

my wife and i foster shelter dogs that are about to be euthanized and train them for cgc certification then adopt them into loving homes. one of the common problems we see are from a dog that was most likely previously abused is that it doesn't know if you are going to hit it or pet it. petting/rubbing their chest is a submissive gesture that almost instantly conveys that you are not going to harm the dog and that you are indeed praising it. this works for two reasons. one you are forfeiting the high ground by using a non dominating approach and two that is an approach that most likely has never resulted in punishment/pain.

"website refuses to take down the ad for seasonal renting of our squated house. so, this is a bit muddy because the website is international (and very popular, starts with a b), the house is in france, the owners (us) are french but the house is squated by uk citizens.

namely, my husband's family, who we let in the house graciously. after a few years, because of bad blood we asked to get our house back, they refused. here again we are rather in the dark, we are communicating through lawyers but it has been on a stand by since june, i think our lawyer is crap but that's another matter.

we originally bought this house to rent it to tourists but never got a chance (the family moved in the moment we bought it).

now, they were legally asked to leave by the 1st of june (i have shown the paper to the website). obivously they didn't, but on top of that, they have been renting rooms to tourists since march.

i contacted the website, provided them with proofs of ownership etc, expressed my desire to see the illegal renting stop. i called several times, sent several mails, starting april. while it was momentarily made unavailable, the renting has continued and still is going on.

last time i called, the guy told me that it was up to their law service, he couldn't say/do anything. i threatened to go to the police, he encouraged me to do so. unfortunately, the police won't do anything, i have to go to the tribunal and ... pay a lot of money that i don't have.

i then appealed to the law that says i can ask for my personnal data to be taken off a website, as there are pictures of our house, exact location etc... same thing, temporary disabled then back on the website, no answer.

from what i understand, the squaters have bought another house and are making the most of our house to make profit during summer before hopefully leaving, but at that rate i'm wondering if they are ever gonna leave if they can rent it for the whole year. i would really want to see it shut down.

do you have any idea what i can do?

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit : sorry to the mods, i think i inadvertantly gave you a lot of work!

to answer some suggestions, it is illegal for me to change the locks, add locks, block them in anyway. even though they are illegal in the house. welcome to france... they also ""only"" rent rooms in the house, while still living in it, so i can't rent it and take over. i still have the keys, my husband went to get some of our stuff at some point and was verbally and almost physically attacked (my family buffered), insulted, they called a friend to block the car and so on... the extent of the bad blood is going quite far now. 

i definetely get your point about the lawyer, we are going on holidays for 4 days, if when we come back nothing has changed i will get a new lawyer. this is ridiculous. i'm litterally wondering if my lawyer has been bribed or something... 

between the website not complying, my lawyer who is crap and these people who litterally pushed my husband to suicide and then refused to help the search party, i am utterly disgusted and hoping they get all lost very, very far...

"final update during our last visit my step-daughter informed us she was being sexually abused at home, please help.. after a string of bad news i have finally gained the ability to bring a positive update to the sub.

from the time we discovered my wife's ex had absconded with the children, we documented every action we took while we found a lawyer who then informed us we would need to retain two lawyers themselves and one where the children were now located which we had confirmed to be new brunswick.

after retaining both lawyers we got in front of a judge, and we won! we now have full custody of all the children, he can only file any further actions by coming to alberta to do so and we have full control of access to the children whom he can't remove from the province, if he wants to see them he has to come here. we are so happy and i just wanted to finally share good news with you all as your help and support has been absolutely wonderful! thanks la!

"scam received a paypal email in spanish and found out someone had access to my account for over a month and then transferred money from my bank account to my paypal balance. this is more of a cautionary tale than anything else. i was out to dinner last night when i received an email from paypal, in spanish. i assumed it was a phishing attempt until i saw that it actually came from @paypal.com

i put the email through google translate and it churned out perfect english (no misspellings) and informed me that my request to transfer $500.00 from my bank account to my paypal balance was processing and that the funds would be available on monday. when i went to log in to my account, my password didn't work so i reset it and i did indeed see the -500.00 transfer in my account, so the email was legit.

paypal was closed when this happened but i called my bank to alert them of the fraud.

i called paypal this morning and when i went to log in to my account again, they'd changed my password *again* overnight. i went through and changed all my passwords everywhere and paypal sent me a secure reset password thing and locked down my account. 

turns out, someone gained access to my email and sat on my paypal account for a month and tried to slip this in on the sly. paypal said that they send the email in spanish because most people will assume that it is spam and not realize it's a legitimate paypal email. once the money is available, they transfer it to their own account. she said i was fortunate to catch it before it got to that point because they're able to cancel the transaction. super creepy knowing someone was watching all my uber transactions for a month.

anyway, i had never heard of this particular scam so i hope my story helps someone else! if you see an email from paypal in spanish or another language, double-triple check it!

"by making a 6000+ km drunk trip. actually happened a few years ago; using a throwaway because i still work with some of those people...

i was living in south-east asia back then, and i was regretting to have moved so far away from home (i'm from europe) for a job i didn't like. one evening my manager took me out for drinks and we got quite hammered. around midnight we said goodbye and i took a cab home, where i signed on skype and started chatting with a friend living in barcelona. he told me how much he loved his life there, and jokingly said that i should join him...

this is when massively-drunken me decided ""you know what? f\*\*\* it, let's do it!"". i looked on skyscanner and found a flight leaving barcelona around 2am with a layover in qatar. i bought the tickets on my credit card, packed my bag (including, for some reason, my 25-dvd full series of battlestar galactica), and jumped in a cab to the airport. on my way, i wrote an email to my manager telling him that i was leaving the country and wouldn't come back. 

i managed to make it just in time to drop my bags at check-in, go trough immigration, pass security screening and board the plane - all of this without anyone stopping me for being so obviously drunk. so happy to be ""finally free"", i sat down and fell asleep almost instantly. fast forward 6 hours. i woke up, looked around, realized that wasn't as rock'n'roll as i my drunk self thought i was, and had one of the most brilliant ""well, shit."" moments of my life. 

after landing in qatar for the layover, i managed to call my manager and i explained him the situation (he was pretty pissed, but took it quite easy). then i convinced the airline to convert the remainder of my barcelona trip to a ticket back home (bullshitted them that the client i was supposed to visit cancelled last minute). unfortunately, they could not fly me back to my origin in the next 48 hours because all flights were full, and i had to settle with a flight to a neighbour country (flight was still something like 10h later). from there i had to change airports by taxi, managed to get into another plane that brought me home, and rushed to the office after having missed one day and a half of work. 

no need to say my return to the office was pretty awkward, not to mention that the ceo of the company was visiting that day and asked several people about my whereabouts... in addition, that whole trip cost me altogether around usd 1500, and a lifetime of jokes from my then-manager (shout out to him btw, he covered my stupid ass 100% on this one).

"for threatening to quit my friend's podcast if he doesn't stop bringing his girlfriend on the show?. me and my friend, mark, have our own podcast dedicated to movies and entertainment. the podcast was his idea and he's more or less the main host, but i'm the co-host and we both appear on every episode, sometimes just the two of us and sometimes with other friends. but about a month ago, mark brought in his girlfriend, meg, and she added absolutely nothing to that episode. we were discussing the phase 4 of mcu films and during our conversation, meg just randomly interrupts and asks ""is batman in the mcu?"" the whole episode was just her asking really dumb questions like that and mark had to explain to me that she doesn't really follow movies as close as we do. i asked him why he even brought her on, and he said ""she wanted to be on, so i said yes."" i even told him that our podcast would benefit from having guests who are more knowledgeable on movies and he said that he'll try to explain that to her.

ever since then, she's been on every episode we've done and our podcast has been taking some heat for it. comments have been left telling us that she's detrimental since she rarely knows what she's talking about and she always interjects with comments and questions that make no sense. for example, a few weeks ago we were talking about hobbs and shaw and meg kept referring to idris elba as chris rock. we kept having to correct her and she said ""didn't a movie with chris rock just come out?"" we had no clue what she was talking about and it was really frustrating. whenever she's not making stupid comments, she's always interrupting with some non sequitur, like one time when she randomly asked if soup counts as a drink while we were discussing the new zombieland 2 trailer.

but a couple of days ago is when things got ugly. me, mark, meg, and a couple of other friends were on the show and we were suppose to be giving our thoughts on ready or not, but meg seemed to be upping her interrupting, non sequitur game. i was trying to give my thoughts on the movie, but meg was taking selfies and kept asking mark what she thought of them. i was really trying to control myself, but she just kept interrupting me with questions like ""what's this movie even about?"" and ""are we ever getting another titanic movie?"" it reached a point where i was trying to talk and she interrupted by asking ""have any of you guys ever been to paris?"" i lost my temper and shouted ""shut the fuck up!"" at her. and while we were still recording, mark yells at me to not talk to her like that and i started yelling that i'm done with the show. 

i stormed out and called mark later, telling him that i'm no longer going to be part of the podcast if he keeps bringing meg on. i explained that she's affecting our views, but he said that she keeps asking to be on and he doesn't want to say no to her. i reiterated that i'm going to quit if he keeps letting meg on and then he accuses me of ruining our podcast and that i'm ""going too far.""",3
"$2000 worth of unauthorized charges on stamps.com and the claim they cannot correct it. learn from our mistakes.. so this weekend my wife checked our bank account and found we had $2000 worth of charges from stamps.com that we did not make. ~~two years ago~~ a few months ago she signed up for their service for some shipping but found it cheaper to use the post office. well sometime friday night someone got into her account (using an old password she hasn't used in years) and ordered $2000 worth of labels in increasing amounts. first $30, then $110 then $300 and so on and so on. since stamps.com doesn't have any after hours support or anyone on site with the holiday yesterday, they claim there is nothing they can do and all the labels/postage have been printed. 

we called our bank, disputed the charges, had the card replaced and now we have to wait up to 10 days to get the $2000 back to our account.

while on the phone the rep lectured my wife about proper password safety and actually  said ""if you watched the news you'd know this is a problem"". wifey says it sounds like the rep was reading from a script so this is likely not an isolated issue. while doing some quick googling this weekend we found more than a few people reporting the same issue this week. seems like this was a coordinated effort to coincide with the holiday to limit people's ability to fight it.

so, learn from our mistakes. 

1) never reuse passwords. ever. the last few months we have been diligent about this, but we created this account a few years ago and forgotten about it. 

2) don't use your debit card for online purchases. use a credit card because while you fight unauthorized charges you're not eating ramen for 4 days while you sort it out. 

3) do research on businesses before working with them. stamps.com has a less than stellar reputation for being proactive about dealing with fraud.

"i pissed off a local gang member and was so terrified of telling my family that i made up a lie that i got a job in nyc and had to leave as soon as possible.. i was a really dumb kid, like ridiculously dumb. i grew up in baltimore. i partied a lot, did drugs, sold drugs sometimes, but i wasn't the worst of the worst or even close to it really. we lived near gangs and heard shootings a lot but i was always sort of on the periphery of that kind of stuff. 

&#x200b;

anyways, i was 19 years old, at a party. i had no idea whose party it was but it was a ton of fun. while drunk me and my friend were upstairs and we found a big bag of pills, like one of those big zip lock bags, filled all the way to the top, in the back of a mini fridge in one of the bedrooms. we  drunkingly took the bag and put it in my friends book bag. then we left the party, laughing the entire way, talking about how we were gonna split it and all that. it was a white boy party in pigtown, i didn't expect anyone to come after us. i woke up the next morning, my friend had the pills in his bag. i realized that it was an absolutely terrible decision, and right away regretted it, but i also realized there was no real way out of it. i just hoped nobody found out. 

&#x200b;

anyways a few days later my friend beeped me like 7 times in a day (this was 1998) and i called him and he said that people were saying that people knew it was us who took the drugs. and that it was the property of some guy named mikey who was coming to find us, who was apparently a gang banger in west baltimore. he said he heard it all over his high school, and his high school was way more gang infested than mine, so i knew what he was saying was true. he said he was going to new york the next day to go live with his cousin to lay low for a bit, and that i can come if i want. his moms didn't give a shit if he lived or died, so i don't think she minded that he was leaving. my family though? both parents are educated and normal and everything. i couldn't just leave out of the blue. hell, they got worried if i was out past midnight on some nights.  

&#x200b;

so i told my friend (name is jordan, my parents have met him once) to help me create a lie by using his cousin to call my house phone and call my name, then tell me all about a job that he could hook me up with. it worked perfectly, he called my house phone, put on the best old-white-guy accent he could, and mentioned that i had asked about working with him in new york before and that a position opened up. i came home and my parents were thrilled, and they told me to talk to the guy right away and call him back. i called him back and he started yelling at me saying i better not be in his house for longer than a few days and that i owe him for that bullshit he pulled to get my parents on board with that. i still laugh thinking about that whole scenario, it felt like something out of movie but at the time i was so scared that i didn't even think about how ridiculous it all was. i just wanted it to work. 

&#x200b;

my parents were suspicious at the idea that i had to leave the next day, but i told them that i had a friend who was there that i could stay with and i wanted to set up in new york for a week before the job started regardless. this technically wasn't the first time i had left home, i spent a year in college before. the job was a 'low level journalist job' which is what i told them. i told them i would call them everyday. 

&#x200b;

then me and jordan drove our ass to new york that night. freaking out but also kind of... oddly happy that we actually got away with that. guess what? jordan fucking brought the big bag of pills. i suppose i wouldn't know what to do with it regardless, but i was pissed at him. it was oxycodone and e pills, sort of separated in the bag by a weird sheet. oxycotin wasn't a thing yet i don't think. 

&#x200b;

i stayed with jordans cousin and he was really aggressive and rude towards me when we first met. i was kind of terrified by him, but we eventually became closer friends. he was aggressive because he thought i was a gang banger and wanted me out of his apartment asap, but he slowly found out i wasn't and warmed up to me. he also warmed up to us when he found out we had a bunch of drugs. it helped that he had a huge apartment with a spare bedroom. anyways, i eventually found a job, got my own apartment with two roommates. jordan went back to baltimore after like 7 months and was apparently fine. 

&#x200b;

and i kept up the stupid, ridiculous lie that i was working as a journalist at ny1, a local news station. i provided no evidence or anything to support this, i tried to keep contact with my parents as minimal as possible. i eventually told them i got laid off, but that i had another job, my real job, set up for me. its funny, because something like that would never work today. they would have googled ny1 and realized there was no way my uneducated self could have gotten a job there. i didn't even know what it was, but its a major news station in nyc. 

&#x200b;

anyways, that is basically the entire story. i love telling it, although for quite a few years i didn't tell \*anyone\* because i was still so scared of getting found out by 'mikey' or whoever the fuck drugs those were. i would visit my parents a few times a year later, figuring i was fine. nothing happened. no scary rumors or anything that someone was out to get me. in a way, i am glad it happened? i would end up becoming a life long new yorker and would find a great career and my wife here. i thought i was only gonna be there for a few weeks, maybe a few months. nope, i would spend my life there basically.

"for ""causing a scene"" with police in front of my gfs new apt?. i left my gfs apartment to pick up my nephew who was staying for the night, and to pick up some food. coming back, as i'm driving in, i make a wrong turn because its a new place, so i took the long way to her unit. i'm definitely driving a bit slower than usual traffic because everything is still new to me, plus there are a bunch of speed bumps and my car is lower. a cop followed me as soon as i turned in.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

once i parked, i texted my gf that a cop was following me. i get our stuff when he cuts the spotlight on me and turns on his lights. by this time we're already out of the car. he walks up to me and asks me what i'm doing. in general, my philosophy is to say very little to police when i'm approached in an official capacity. i've had some run-ins before, and my nephew has priors.

&#x200b;

i responded matter of factly, ""nothing really. you?"" i thought it was a friendly conversation. thats my normal response to anyone asking me that question. he tells me he's the one that asks the questions, not me. ok. i'm also the one that doesn't answer questions so if we want to go that route. he asks me why i went the wrong way, and why was i driving so slow. i just say that i don't agree with the premise, and that neither one of those things are crimes. he says, ""what are you, a sovereign citizen? give me your id.""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

by this time, he's been shining his flashlight inside my car looking for shit. my gf is out front, and due to his lights 2 sets of neighbors are also out front. i state that again, i didn't commit a crime and since this isn't a stop and id state i don't have to id myself. i wasn't pulled over, i was approached after i was already parked. he says he got a call that someone who fit my description and matched my car was driving around the parking lot looking inside of cars, there was a recent car theft in that lot. he literally started following me the second i pulled in, which was 2 minutes ago, so i know thats bullshit. my gf speaks up to say something, and i tell her i've got this.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

he then turns to my nephew and demands id. i tell him that he's a minor, and i don't give him permission to speak to him. i say that lets not act like he didn't run my plates, so we both know he knows who i am, and unless i'm being detained, i'm leaving. i walk inside and make sure they both follow me. nothing else happens.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

she's really upset that i would speak to the police in that manner, especially considering they have had some minor crime recently. i was never rude, i just don't want to answer a bunch of questions. she's also highly embarrassed that i would do this in front of her neighbors. do what? i'm not the one that turned the discussion sideways, and i'm not the one that started lying. also, we're black while my gf and her apartment complex is all white. that may have something to do with how i've experienced police encounters versus how she has.  

&#x200b;

edit:  they've had a couple of car break-ins, and 1 home break-in within the past 2 months or so.  they put a cop on site for nights like this.  gf insists its just for security, and its the same as having to check-in at the front in a gated community.  lots of people have apparently been questioned, and all you have to do is tell them where you're going and give them your id.  although i'm glad they're being proactive, i still feel like i didn't sign up for all of that.",3
"i helped steal all of our final exam answers in high school and one kid got a zero on all his exams after getting caught with the answers. this happened sophomore year of high school, which was thirteen years ago..

&#x200b;

i honestly can't remember how the idea came about, but somehow or another a bunch of us got the idea of showing up to school early and going into our classrooms (which were almost always unlocked) and getting the answer keys to our final exams. we went to a fairly large high school so all of the exams were standardized so the answers worked for almost everyone's tests. i think there were two or three of us who were the ones who took the initiative to get all the answers. i remember sneaking into my music appreciation and my algebra classrooms to steal the exams. people also stole the exams for spanish and chemistry.

&#x200b;

fast forward and the answers are being passed around to a ton of kids in all sorts of different classrooms. kids were sharing answer cheat sheets left and right. everyone had typed in the scantron answers into their ti-83 calculators for their algebra exams, had them written on small pieces of paper for chemistry and spanish, etc. i remember looking around my spanish class and thinking this was getting out of hand in the study hour before the exam as almost everyone had the answers or was getting the answers. this was supposed to be for only our friends but it started getting out to everyone. at this point i was getting worried something bad was going to happen and was thinking i needed to look through my binder/locker after class to make sure i didn't have any answer keys floating around anywhere.

&#x200b;

then the shit began to fly. one of our assistant principals storms into my spanish class (looking for me it turns out) and walks right into a girl sitting next to the door copying down the answers on a small piece of paper. she grabs the girl and takes her to the office. the student never returned to take her test and ended up getting a zero for cheating and failed the class. 

&#x200b;

right as i was finishing my exam (purposely missing more answers than i was planning on at the beginning because i knew something was up) the assistant principal comes back in and asks me to come with her to the office.  when i get to the office all 4 principals and the school security officer are waiting for me in a conference room. they say that they've been told i helped steal all the exams and are going to search me. i'm freaking the fuck out at this point as i'm almost positive i've still got the algebra exam key in my binder somewhere. lucky for me, my binder was an absolute disaster. every page from every single class i took was just shoved randomly into this binder/the bottom of my backpack with no organization or anything whatsoever. organization and tidiness weren't my strong suites at that point in my life. they start to tear through my bag and binder throwing pages all over this conference table, saying that when they find what they're looking for i'm going to fail all my classes. i'm so scared i can't barely speak. they're asking questions and i can barely get words out to answer. then they get to the bottom of my backpack and binder somehow without finding anything. pissed the fuck off, they tell me i can leave as at this point the school day is over. i then get my confidence back in spades and throw an absolute fucking fit saying this is fucking ridiculous and they need to clean my shit up off the table and put it back in my binder and backpack. destroying my property for no reason, that they were searching me for no reason and this is bullshit yada yada. one of the assistant principals starts to shove all the papers back into my bag with the most smug look on her face.

&#x200b;

when i finally get all my shit shoved into my bag and leave my friends have been blowing my phone up. they thought i was for sure fucked and was going to fail my classes. i call/text everyone with a big sigh of relief saying i got away with it and they didn't find anything. this is when i find out that the way they had found out i helped steal the exams was that they caught another kid with an exam key who ratted me out. this poor kid was a 4.0 gpa student, in all the honors classes, on multiple sports teams, and in plenty of clubs/activities at the school. he was given a zero on all of his exams, failed his classes, and his parents transferred him schools the next year. i never heard a word about the kid again. while i, the stoner skateboard kid, got away scotch free. i feel so bad he got caught because he was a good kid, but at the same time fuck him for ratting me out!

&#x200b;

tl;dr - helped steal almost all the final exams sophomore year of high school and passed them around the school. one kid who was a 4.0 gpa, extremely smart kid, got caught with an exam key and was given a zero on all his exams and transferred schools the next year never to be heard from again. i got searched by all the principals in a conference room but they didn't find shit because my life was a clutterful disaster and i got away with it!",11
"to be creeped out by how a waiter treated my daughter and for making her say thank you?. during a long road trip i stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type cafe/restaurant we've been to many times before. my daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  she also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  

she'd been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  i think he handled it really well and i was more than happy for them to be talking.

a bit later we were sitting at our table and i noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with i was proud as she'd clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she'd been pretty funny.

when he brought the food over though he didn't acknowledge me at all and said directly to her ""do you know you are really beautiful?"" she was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn't look up or respond and so he said it again.  i got her attention and said ""the man is talking to you"" he said it again and she just stared at him so i made her say thank you. 

i was uncomfortable for a few reasons: 

i didn't like his tone or the look on his face, i've seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman

it's one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but i found his word choice ""beautiful"" inappropriate

i made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable 

&#x200b;

later on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake i hadn't ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it's their secret and not to tell mum.

i feel like i witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  

&#x200b;

or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  

also did i let her down by making her thank him when i thought he was being a creep?

i'm a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks i should complain to the restaurant.

"people who push for fireworks to be banned because they have pets need to take a step back. now, come guy fawkes' night and other celebratory events, when fireworks are let off, people are now reacting with intense anger because their dog doesn't like the loud bangs. 

if it's such a inconvenience for you then why don't you try and seek to go elsewhere for the night? it has always been celebrated and always will be. 

you don't pay any thought for people with ptsd, autism, learning difficulties, mental difficulties; it's only your dog you are thinking about. you're wanting the world to suit your own needs because your dog doesn't like the bangs. it's unfortunate that the dogs don't like the loud bangs, but it's for one night to celebrate, then it's all over. 

if you so desperately want an end to fireworks then maybe you should do away with halloween as well? it can't be very pleasant for your dog when strangers come to your door all night dressed up as monsters and such. again, people with agoraphobia, autism, learning difficulties and such things won't much enjoy people coming to their door. i doubt that much of your thoughts go to them.

it's for one night which lasts a few hours then it's all over. i don't agree they should be banned because your dog doesn't like it. i don't imagine your dog likes thunder very much or lightning but it still happens.

edit: i do not agree with individual people letting their fireworks off all through the week at different times. i do agree with them being in a show or set place with a set time. i have had to explain it to multiple people.",6

"boss is withholding my final pay, and i'm pretty sure there's nothing i can do.. i've worked the last two years at a small landscaping company in north east pennsylvania. over that time, my boss has worn me down and over worked me. she is a hard person to work for, and it took time to realize that. i can go into further detail about the boss if asked, but ultimately this post is about how she's withholding my pay. i did give her two weeks notice.  the day before my final day, i reminded her that tomorrow would be my last day, since i gave her my notice on a thursday instead of a friday. she responded that i still owed her a task and that she would withhold $100 from my pay til i did that task.  she wanted me to wash and wax her truck. i told her that i found the task to be demeaning and tried compensating for it by buying her a car wash and wax and some lotto tickets. looking back, i should have just saved the $20. now it's two weeks later, i'm waiting for her to tell me that my pay is ready for me to pick up and she hasn't responded. i know that what she's doing is illegal, and i've seen her do it to other workers (adults and minors alike), but unfortunately she has her business set up in a way that there's very little if no paper trail. she always pays in cash, i've never received a pay stub, the only tax form she gives me is a 1099 misc. i honestly don't have the money for an attorney. it's not about the money to me right now anyway, it's more about the fact that she's petty and gets away doing this somehow. it sucks for me right now. i feel like there's nothing i can do and it burns me up knowing that she's getting away with it. the only thing i can think of, is to warn as many people about her as i can.

so, i don't know if i should approach the situation in anyway, or let it go and deal with it in my own.

"by jokingly insulting my 7-year-old kid in front of their teacher. obligatory didn't happen today, but last week.

people who know me say i'm a gentle soul, but that i have an ""angry listening face"", don't do small talk and can be quite opinionated, so i tend to avoid other people at my children's school, because interactions usually don't go well...

so last week thursday, i arrived at school to pick up my kids and went to the store right next-door to buy some groceries. school is in english and we speak french at home, which means we can usually say whatever we want without anyone eavesdropping. while waiting in line, i turned to my daughter and went ""you're ugly"", to which she replied ""thank you"".

now, you need to know the back story... there is this french black comedy called ""tatie danielle"" which features an angry, old lady insulting and abusing everyone. in one of the scenes she tells a mother ""your girl is nice, but damn, she's so ugly"". this sort of became a running joke in our family and i feel this also teaches my kids not to take insults at face value. we sometimes throw out quotes from the movie, mimicking an old lady voice.

of course, i did not know that the only teacher in the school who understands french was behind me... and this of course is my daughter's teacher. she was shocked and let out a small gasp.

i turned around and she told my angry listening face ""your daughter is not ugly"". she then started talking to my daughter: is your father tough at home with you? is he mean to you? what about your mother, is she tough with you?

without missing a beat, my daughter went: nope, they are both very cool.

to this day, this teacher still looks at me suspiciously.

tl;dr: i jokingly told my daughter she was ugly. she said thank you. all this while her teacher was standing behind me, who now thinks i abuse my kids.",4
"by having my mom take me to the er for blue balls. this happened about four years ago when i was 16, just after getting my first gf. thought i knew everything there was about sex and sexuality after all the hours i spent researching in preparation for what i thought was coming to me. i was very, very wrong.

&#x200b;

she came over one day after school while my mom was gone and we dry humped liked clothed bunnies for about an hour or so. she had work so she left shortly after and then i hopped on xbox ready to brag to my friends about all the ass i just grabbed. about 30 minutes later, my balls started to hurt. excruciatingly so. i assumed it was just from getting my balls smooshed for so long and that it would pass quickly. it didn't. by the time my mom came home, it had gotten intolerable. i laid on the floor of my room with baggy boxers and my legs wide open. any movement or touch was awful.

&#x200b;

thing is, i had heard of blue balls but i always thought it was just a metaphorical thing to describe when you thought you were gonna get lucky, but didn't. when i looked up ""incredible pain in my balls"", all that came up was stuff about infections and circulation being cut off. scary stuff. i guess no medical diagnosis for whatever blue balls is comes up when you look that up because its just assumed that you know you have blue balls, if you have blue balls.

&#x200b;

i had been scared enough by the search results to justify going through the embarrassment of telling my mom my balls were in pain and i needed to see a doctor. i've always been a known mild masochist to my family in how much i love boxing, so when she asked how bad it was on a scale of 1-10, and i said 9, she took it seriously. we rushed over to the hospital and got me checked in asap. i asked my mom if she could stay in the waiting room and she was cool with it. after being led into a room by the nurse, the doctor examined my testes and began asking me all sorts of questions about my pain and symptoms. when he asked if i had had any sexual activity recently, i reluctantly admitted i was dry humping with my gf earlier that day.

he paused, and asked if i ever ejaculated at any point.

i said no.

at least sixty years old with a completely white comb over and huge glasses, my doctor gets stoic and asks, ""well son, do you think it's possible that you just have blue balls?""

i froze.

""what.""

he raised an eyebrow, smirked a little and said ""if you don't ejaculate after sexual activity, it's possible to get what is commonly known as blue balls, where the testicles are inflamed after all the blood that's gone to them without ever releasing."" or something like that.

maybe i would have started to laugh if my balls didn't hurt so damn much. instead i responded, ""that's a thing!?""

he laughed a little and said yes, he's afraid it is.

i asked what i could do.

he said take an ibuprofen or masturbate.

so i did both.

a pee after 10 hours of driving has nothing on the relief i felt then.

i tried lying to my mom and said it was just an inflammation from laying on them wrong, but she saw through it and said that if she was paying the co-pay for the appointment she wanted the truth. so, i told her how i got something called blue balls from messing around with gf while she was gone. she laughed that i didn't know what blue balls were, and wasn't aware i was sexually active yet.

on the drive home, she asked if i needed any condoms.

cringing, i bitterly said no thank you.

she told me that if i'm going to be sexually active then i need to be safe.

i muttered that we weren't having actual sex.

""well then how did this happen?""

""god can you please just leave it we were just grinding and stuff that's how""

short pause

""well then make sure you masturbate or something after sweety so that this doesn't happen again.""

my mom has always had little inhibition censoring stuff with me, but that has forever taken the cake. my fault for being a dumbass though i guess.

&#x200b;

tl;dr

teenage me messed around with girl for first time. didn't know blue balls actually hurt. had my mom drive me to the er. had to tell her i had been messing with gf and didn't know what blue balls were. my mom recommended i masturbate.

edits 2: meant masochist, not sadist

edits 3: thanks for all the love :) sorry to all the other guys who know the pain :( for everyone who has commented doubt on the existence of blue balls, you are a wretched soggy piece of cauliflower. that is an insult to all men (and apparently in a different form, women?) who have experienced this.

couple pieces of clarification; i was given an ultrasound and a pee test and i think even a blood test for some reason during my examination, both during and before the doc started asking me all the questions. i had to wait for them to confirm that i was fine before i could leave, which sucked because i was embarrassed as shit and just wanted to go home. the doctor didn't just bank on the fact that i was dry humping and didn't finish earlier.",4

"don't announce to others what you plan to do, instead, after the task is completed, share what you did. addictive dopamine gets released at a better time for reinforcing productive work in the future!. psychologists claim that telling people you're going to do something and getting their approval releases dopamine without actually doing the task, becoming a major reinforcement for not following through on plans. by keeping plans more private, you hold off on release of the addictive dopamine until it will reinforce you completing goals. it's a hack for your brain. you get addicted to getting things done!

also, for those who like to play devil's advocate, the counter argument is that public display of goals does help for them to be achieved. there is truth to this, but is mostly refuted in terms of short term versus long term change. public announcements hold us accountable out of fear and fear doesn't lead to long term intrinsic motivation and change only short term action as the driving force in the change is external rather than internal. 

lastly, i'm not saying not to talk through your goals with others, just be sure you're not doing it for the affirmation of setting the goal and be selective with who needs to know (hint: it's not everybody).

"little girls should not be wearing bikinis.. children are far too young to be wearing bikinis.

bikinis are not used as just bathing suits. we all know bikinis sexualize women in a way. they are pretty much just underwear made for water. children's bikinis are sexualizing young girls.

so why the fuck are they wearing them?

weird pedo nibbas are going to be checking out these kids in skimpy outfits. what parent would let their kid dress slutty at such a young age either?

i don't care what anyone says, putting little girls in bikinis is fucked up.

also, young girls don't have curves to keep the bikini in place, which makes the bikini slip. that's never pleasant.

edit: just because i make a post against little girls in bikinis doesn't mean i'm a pedo.

"for not leaving the house when my gf hosts a ""girls night"". so here's the deal. i'm a lesbian as is my gf. before we started dating, she already had a girls night established with some of her friends. i have no problem with this in general and kinda like having the house to myself when she goes to someone else's place and it's important to spend time with your friends. the problem is when she hosts. she expects me to leave the house. 

this feels kinda cruel to me for a few reasons. first, i don't really have anywhere to go. i end up going to see a movie alone or something and wandering around until i can come home. at the moment, i don't really have any friends to do things with. second, i'm a girl too. if the event were simply ""no partners"" and not ""girls night"" i'd get it a bit more, but a few of the women in the group dated for a bit and both were and are allowed to go to girls night. this makes it feel just kind of arbitrary that i can't attend if they are in my house, let alone that i have to leave. third, it is literally my house. i own it. my gf does contribute some financially, so i don't want to minimize her contributions, but i bought the place before we met and being kicked out of my own house does not sit well with me.

so, if i refused to leave next girls night?

"i wanted to update everyone on my previous post my mother sent me a hateful letter.. first off, i wanted to thank everyone for all of their support. it truly meant a lot and made me feel so much better about myself and this whole situation. it's been taking me quite some time to get through all of the comments because there were just so many.

i wanted to update everyone on what happened since the last time i posted. so i blocked my mother in all forms of contact, phone, email, text, etc... i left my father unblocked because i do have two younger siblings at home and wanted to just make sure i was reachable in case of an emergency.

a few days after that letter, i got a call from my father. i answered it but planned on hanging up if it was my mother and just blocking that number as well. he said hello and then went on a lecture about how i ""disrespected my mother"" and ""am an ungrateful little b**ch"". he also told me that i was so longer welcome in their home. i was not to come back for any holidays or have any contact with them. 

i told him i was fine with that and hung up. i immediately blocked his number on all forms of contact as well. it was tough to hear that because i used to be close to my father when i was younger. we were always called partners in crime, so to hear him to take her side was rough, but i didn't cry. i knew they weren't worth it and not worth my tears. i ended up getting a few texts of hateful family members but just blocked them as well.

i also know that i probably won't be allowed to be in contact with my siblings till they turn 18 because they still live at home. we used to extremely close so i hope one day we can be again.

my husband and i decided it was in our families best interest to get a restraining order again my mother and father. just to fully show them that i am done with them. we have our adoption case at the end of this month so we plan on waiting till april just so we don't screw anything up with that. 

we also talked to the kids school and told them nobody can pick them up unless we send a note that day, we changed our locks and put some of the evidence in a safety box. we do live 14 hours away which is nice.

i decided not to let them have this power of my and my family. my mil and fil are absolutely incredible. and more then willing to step up and be both sets of grandparents.

"my father has about $400k just sitting in his savings account. what are his best options for long term (10-15 year) returns?. my dad is 61 years old, has a great paying government job and has no plans to retire. he loves his job and wants to work until he dies. subsequently, he has never really planned for retirement. he has some funds in his 401k but the majority of his money he tends to hoard in a savings account because he sees it as being more liquid as opposed to having his money ""tied up"" in investments. 

i have tried explaining to him numerous times that he needs to put his money to work so it can earn some interest as opposed to it just sitting there. but i am no pro at investing. what would be the best advice for next steps? ideally i think he would benefit from a ""set it and forget it"" type approach where he can dump his funds and watch them grow over the course of the next 10-15 years. assuming an average annual return of 6%, i think he can make some decent gains. but again, i am no pro - my best guess for him would be vanguard etfs. or is this amount worth looking into a fiduciary? what say you, pf?

"my (36f) husband (35m) of 4 years got us into an accident from staring at tits on a billboard.. last weekend we were on the highway and there was a big billboard advertising an oktoberfest event. the picture was of a woman holding pitchers of beer under her chest, and the outfit was one of those corset over a lowcut blouse things, so her boobs were propped up. the image was cropped to show just her chest and the beer.

my husband, for background and context, has had a loooong history of checking out other girls especially if they're showing any cleavage. he's openly done this in front of me thinking i wouldn't notice. it's not half as sneaky as he thinks. he's done it to friends. he's done it to my sister. he's done it obviously enough that strangers like waitresses as well as people we know have been uncomfortable. i've seen it many times. again, he's always shocked i could tell. he'll try to play it off as just being zoned out, or he liked her outfit, or whatever. it's all bullshit. those conversations where i call him out never really go anywhere because he either sticks to whatever the denial du jour is, or says it's normal for guys to notice other women and it doesn't mean he'd ever pursue anything with them (to be clear i've never caught him in any inappropriate interactions with women, and i do not believe he'd ever cheat, but he doesn't see my point that ogling someone else while you're in a relationship is simply a shitty thing to do even if you're not trying to sleep with them.) 

also all his porn tastes have women with large breasts. this has made me insecure in the past because my boobs are smaller than average. he did decide to stop watching porn when i expressed this, i didn't ask him to, he offered on his own. i believe he's followed through on this; i haven't walked in on him wanking to it or seen it open in other tabs when he shows me things like i used to. 

so i've more or less accepted that as a human he is still going to notice attractive women sometimes and while i wish he would at least be discreet, what can i really do. for what it's worth this is the only real problem to me in our relationship. every other area is more than good, especially compared to my past relationships before i met him. and he does give me plenty of attention, is very attracted to me and we have a great sex life.

anyway, with that out of the way, back to the incident. as soon as i saw that billboard i glanced over at my husband. and what do you know. he was gawking out his window, it was on the left side of the highway and we were on the right so his head was craned to the left instead of looking ahead. then suddenly we started drifting, people were honking, and he spun out of control. we were swerving between our lane and the righthand lane until he slammed the breaks. but it wasn't in time to keep us from hitting the cement barrier on the side of the road. so we came to a stop at an angle that was sticking into traffic. right as we finally stopped i saw someone hit another car, so that was two other people involved. there were no injuries, thank fucking god. this was one of the scariest moments of my entire life, i legitimately thought we were about to die. there was a decent amount of cars on the road. it's a miracle he didn't hit anyone and no one was hurt. 

state troopers came and shut down most of the lanes to sort everything out. i won't bore you with details about insurance and repairs and who's at fault for what. the relevant part of the state police exchange was that when they asked my husband why he lost control of his vehicle, he said ""i was really tired and i guess i started to fall asleep for a second."" nope. he'd had a normal night's sleep, it was early in the afternoon, he was wide awake gawking at a gigantic pair of tits like a teenager. i did not correct him in the moment in front of the officer because i was absolutely mortified, and furious with him.

i'm still furious days later. like what the hell? has he truly got this little self control even while driving 60-something mph? our 3 year old was in the car with us, screaming and has been anxious to get in the car since then. he could have gotten any or all of us killed! he could have killed someone else!

i understand that accidents happen but this was not a true accident to me. he could have kept his eyes on the damn road.

i'm just so exhausted of having the same argument about this issue of his. of course he vehemently denied he was looking at the billboard. so what is there to do? i'm seriously afraid now to be in a car when he's driving. if that's all it takes for him to lose focus then i'll just stay home.

how do i get him to see the severity of this? he won't even admit why it happened. does he not even care, or what? i'm totally at a loss. 

tl;dr: husband crashed our car, and indirectly caused two other cars to crash, because he was too busy staring at the dr tj eckleberg of boobs.",7

"girlfriend 31f wanted an open relationship. i 34m reluctantly agreed. she freaked out now that i am sleeping with other women.. about 4 months ago my girlfriend of 6 years brought up having an open relationship. at first i said no and was incredibly angry that she would even ask that of me. the thought of my girlfriend sleeping with other guys made me livid, so did the idea that she felt i wasn't giving her what she needs. 

after a few days she brought it up again and i reluctantly agreed to the arrangement. i decided to go ahead with it because i wanted her to be happy and not end up cheating behind my back. i do love her and realize that relationships consist of compromises and finding middle grounds.

i told her we could have an open relationship, but i don't want her telling me about other guys or where she is going when she does it. that she just needs to play it safe because i don't want any stds. 

anyhow, about a month into the new arrangement i realized she was meeting up with some guy for sex. i was pissed at first, but decided to start taking advantage of my new found freedom as well. there is no point in me sulking and being angry.

i started getting on dating apps and talking to new women and going out on dates. i, too, started sleeping with other women. i currently have 3 fwbs that i see fairly regularly. 

anyhow, one of the fwbs likes sending me a bunch of nude selfies. she also likes taking videos of us having sex and sometimes sends me the videos. 

my girlfriend snooped my phone earlier and went ballistic. she asked me how many women am i seeing and why i am participating in sex videos. after yelling at me for a while she has been stuck in the bedroom sobbing and doesn't want to be around me. 

i am puzzled and really not sure what to do or even why she reacted the way she did considering she proposed this type of relationship. i am not sure how to proceed or even what to say to her. 

edit: i want to thank everyone for their input. i am at work now and will try to read and reply to some of the responses. 

my girlfriend and i didn't talk at all last night, but she did say she wanted to talk this morning right before i was leaving for work. i told her we would talk tonight after work. 


edit 2: 

things didn't really go too well last night. we spoke about a number of things. she said that she was shocked to see that i was seeing so many women and that she thought i was taking the open relationship thing too far. we never discussed how many partners was acceptable and she thought it would just be one partner on the side. she also said some of the texts she saw hurt her because she thought they crossed a line. 

she said she the open relationship is a mistake and she wants to go back to a monogamous relationship. 

i told her it is too late for that. she already has involved people outside of our relationship into this mess, and that i am not going to hurt others by breaking off my relationships with them because she didn't have the foresight to realize other people would be affected by her choices. i told her i think she has been acting selfishly throughout this whole situation and that it has changed my perception of her as a person. 

i told her that she hurt me proposing this open relationship, but i accepted it to try to make her happy. i told her while i initially didn't want to be in an open relationship, i am actually enjoying being with other partners. 

i told her i love her, but i believe this relationship has been damaged beyond repair and i am not going to stop seeing others. i put her needs before my own before, but i no longer have the desire to do that anymore. 

after reading comments on here and reflecting on the entire situation i believe it is best that we part ways, so i told her i am moving out and ending the relationship. i told her she can stay in the apartment until the lease is up but i am moving out as soon as i find a new apartment.

"i left my wife because i thought she was cheating, she became a heroin addict. i found out she never cheated.. disclaimer: i have always been an emotional, stupid, dumbass wrecking ball of a person. i wish i could say this was out of the norm. i've been in therapy since i was 11 years old. 

i met my wife in 2005 in a nightclub in lower manhattan, and she was an amazing person and we connected right away. we dated, then got married in 2007. i was 23, she was 25, but we were in love and to us it didn't really matter. we actually had a good marriage, and i loved her, and she loved me. i was shocked at how much we got along, for so many years, meanwhile most people in relationships started to hate me after like 3 months. she still adored me after 7 years. but leave it up to me to screw that up completely. 

in 2014, i had suspicions she was cheating on me. not strong suspicions, but she had a coworker who she was friends with who was... well, really attractive. i just thought, why be friends with this guy? she didn't often make friends with her coworkers, why this guy specifically? because he was hot? she was secretive about him, which made me way more suspicious. i remember one day she told me that she had a secret about him which she would eventually tell me. i probably should have listened and understood what she said more, the hints she were dropping seem really obvious in retrospect. i didn't get any of her hints. 

for a bit, she got defensive over her phone. that was when i sort of began really suspecting things. one day i checked her phone and all i saw was him texting her saying he really needs to speak to her, right now. like a bunch of texts. also texts about sort of inappropriate sex stuff. but it was really the ""i need to see you now"" texts which threw me off. 

i didn't even confront her. that's the worst part. i just left, and went to new mexico to go stay with my parents. i was *so sure* she cheated on me, nothing could convince me otherwise. i was so hurt  that i became suicidal for a tiny bit, then i went to therapy and got better. but i blocked her in every possible way i could. she had no idea why i left. my therapist kept telling me to contact her, i never listened. i actually lied to my therapist and said i did. there were some times where she called my parents and i talked to her and just said that i knew she was cheating, and that i couldn't be with her and that was that and then i just hung up. it was too horrible and emotional and i just wanted to put it all behind me somehow. i wanted to act as if it never happened. i didn't have the balls to deal with it. i didnt filed divorce papers at that time. i never explained anything further than that, i just hung up. 

in 2015, i painfully reconnected with her. i never told her why i left. i felt horrible, but i also felt angry at her for cheating. i never wanted to know who she cheated on me with, or what the situation was, i just wanted her out of my life. but when i finally connected with her, i just found an entirely new person. she was in and out of rehab, she was a pill addict. she said it started after i had left her, that she had a lot of pills left over from a surgery she had (she had a knee surgery in 2013) and started taking them a lot to  deal with the pain of me leaving her. then she connected with her friend who started selling pills to her. 

anyways, after a bit more of talking with her online over quite a few weeks, i eventually told her the situation as to why i thought she cheated. it was sort of this unspoken thing beforehand, i told her i didn't want her to bring it up. then i just asked her, straight up. and she told me, that was her coworker, and he was gay. she hung out with him a lot, and he would often call her and text her to 'come over' so they could talk about his problems. i checked his facebook, he came out officially as gay in 2014, before that he was in the closet. also, the 'inappropriate' sex stuff they were talking about suddenly made so much fucking sense. they were comparing the way women and men have sex to the way men have sex with men. but it didn't seem obvious by the texts i read, it just... kind of sounded like they were planning to do anal with each other. in retrospect it seems painfully obvious, but at the time it wasn't. i just wish i didn't fucking freak out and leave. i think if i even mentioned his name, it would have clicked for her, and she would have told me it was just a misunderstanding. but she had zero idea why i suspected her of cheating. 

 i left my wife, never spoke to her again, and went halfway across the country over a misspoken series of texts that i read because i was a sneaky fucking bastard and was too emotional to even ask my wife what the problem was. i just left. i never asked her to clarify anything. 

she would go on to become a heroin addict from a pill addict. she posts sometimes about how she is '3 weeks sober!' but its never longer than that. i am basically an alcoholic and live near my parents in albuquerque. i have zero interest in finding a girlfriend, instead i just have a bunch of meaningless one night stands when i go out on weekends. i am almost always hammered and coked or adderalled up when i go out on weekends. i sort of have friends, but not really, they're just a bunch of alcoholics and party people in the area who i link up with on weekends. i cant be away from my parents now, they're the only people i enjoy being around. i am just an emotionally fragile mess who feels like they completely ruined someones life over something so fucking stupid. i know it sounds stupid but for the past few years my parents are the only friends i have and the only people i really see besides the people at my job and the women i sleep with, who i never make connections with. i cannot help but think i will literally never get over this. the fact that i ruined her life over this. i go to therapy, and it helps but not enough.

i still sometimes talk to her. we officially got divorced, nothing split, in 2017. she is a heroin addict and i am horribly depressed so we have some relations, but i cant help but think that i ruined her life far, far more than i ruined mine. and the worst part is? the only reason i am in pain is because i ruined her life.

"for leaving my pregnant gf after a fake ""miscarriage""?. basically my parents, her parents, and nearly all my friends are calling me the asshole for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend (it's my kid) so just looking for perspective here. i'll keep things as objective as possible and happily accept my final judgement.

&#x200b;

3 months ago we found out that my gf (or ex now) is pregnant. it was a big surprise since we take precautions (condoms, bc) but she said it might've been a broken condom + she was bad about staying on bc routinely. regardless, it was confirmed she's pregnant. i'm 21 and she's 20.

&#x200b;

i took the news badly at first. i became surly, didn't talk, and just kept to myself for 2 whole days right after she told me. i was terrified and did not want to be a father at all. i just needed time to adjust to the news. i think she expected happiness from both of us as she imagined i'd scoop her up and kiss her and cry tears of happiness after hearing she's pregnant (i know this bc she even referenced that scene in the office where pam/jim find out they're having a baby).

&#x200b;

our relationship during this time was extremely rocky because she wanted us to be engaged before the baby came, and i dragged my feet. i took her to all of her appointments, paid for as much as i could afford, and was there 24/7 for anything she needed. i guess it was more emotional connection that i just couldn't force through and she could tell.

&#x200b;

a few weeks ago she sits me down and tells me she lost the baby. she says she had stomach cramps and then she miscarried. i was asking her a lot of health questions (i didn't know if a miscarriage this late into a pregnancy was normal?) and she kinda waves me off and is like don't worry i'm ok. after this our relationship's getting slightly better only because i'm slightly more relaxed now. she could tell and asks me to be honest about how i feel about the miscarriage. i tell her i'm sad it's happened so suddenly and mostly still worried for her but deep down i am really relieved because i 100% wasn't ready to be a father.

&#x200b;

wrong answer. she starts screaming, crying, throwing things at me. she says she's not miscarried, that it was a test to see my dedication and i've failed it completely. in short we fought for like 3 whole days after this, with little sleep bc she'd randomly throw cups of icy water on me if i dozed off. at the end of that i said i can't do this anymore and broke up with her. i told her i'll be there for the baby and i'll pay my share of whatever is needed but i can't be her boyfriend and i can't marry her.

&#x200b;

\-----

now friends and family are all telling me that i overreacted, that its just pregnancy hormones and could i blame her? everyone's saying things like ""you can't leave a 20 year old girl to be a single mother"" but i know that if i married her it could be the worst mistake of my life. aita?",3

"i bought a house with my ex. we weren't broken up at the time. we had been together for years and were getting married the following summer...until he cheated. since we had the house over our heads, we tried to work it out, and i supported him through some really rough months. he then decided he wasn't in love with me and didn't know if he ever was. we are only a couple of years into owning the house and have built up pretty much zero equity. i realize that i made a ton of mistakes, but i am trying to get through this with the least amount of pain.

here's the problem: he's still on the mortgage, and i have no idea what to do. i looked into refinancing, but rates are higher than when we bought. with fees and interest,it would add $30,000 on to what i'm paying. i looked into assuming the loan, which i did qualify for, but they are charging $11,000 in fees, which i do not have. i contacted a realtor about selling the house, which i absolutely do not want to do (i have put an immense amount of work into the upkeep of the house after a few issues came up), but they said that i would lose a ton of money at this point (around $20,000). as far as renting goes, i do not have the finances available to get it into rental quality. i also have a job that prevent me from having the time or money to deal with having renters.

i'm feeling pretty trapped. i don't really have the money to stay or go, and my ex is not helpful in this situation at all. he does not have any money or effort to contribute. i'm hoping someone out there can spot a way that i can get through this somewhat intact.

  
edit: after several of you pointed out how obscene the $11k assumption price was, i contacted my mortgage company again. they admitted their mistake, and dropped $8k from that price, which means i can afford it. thanks for all of the assistance!",10

"my m20 girlfriend f19 of 7 years died in a car accident in front of me. i am completely broken. i need some support.. hello everyone. this is not my main account on reddit.

i was in a relationship with my girlfriend for 7 years, she was 12 and i was 13 when we first met. since then we never broke up, and we literally grew up together. till the last moment we used to love each other a lot.

ten days ago we were walking on the pavement and we were heading to the gym.  after some point, we see a huge truck heading towards us, most likely the driver lost the control of the it. my girlfriend was standing right next to me, on the right side. i managed to dodge the truck, but my girlfriend unfortunately didn't.. there is not much to say, and describing the whole incident is not an easy thing for me to do.. basically her body was ripped apart..it was an instant death.

since then i have been completely broken. i lost someone who was always by my side, always next to me for 7 years. my first love, and someone i thought i could spend my whole life with. she was so young, and that was really unfair..

i am currently studying psychology at the university, but since her death i haven't attended any classes. i am home all day, no mood to do anything and i feel i will never get over it.. i can't help myself..my family and friends are next to me but still.. every night i have dreams of her and of the whole incident..

i know i need to eventually move on, but it looks so hard for me.. has any one of you lost their partner like that?

i need some support and some advices on how to handle this.. thank you everyone.

"for playing the sexism card as a male. i work in an office where i'm one of the youngest and lowest level employees along with two others. 
being one of the low level staff i get asked to do a lot of admin/odd jobs that aren't anything to do with my job role. 

this has never really bothered me while i was the only one at my my level & being the youngest (22) and hypothetically the fittest, however, a few months ago my work hired two girls my age at my level.

i initially thought great someone to share the load of ""crap jobs"" with so i can focus more on my actual work. boy was i wrong 

whenever it came time to lift a box or screw in a lightbulb i was always the only option,they aren't allowed to lift a finger and my boss justifies it as ""being a gentleman""

which to me seems like bullshit 
i don't expect them to be able to do everything, there are some boxes i can hardly lift but they could at least help with the small ones or the other jobs. 

i'm not the strongest either and coupled with the fact i have never had any manual handling training i have done my back in a few times which would have been easily avoided by sharing the job with someone else. 

so anyway we had our annual staff review this week and i decided to ask what the deal was and whether i could split the work. 

i first said that i felt lower than everyone else and i felt it unfair that i was the only one asked to do these jobs despite there being two others at my level.
my boss couldn't comprehend this.
he said ""you dont expect the girls to do this do you?"" to which i said ""yes and i find it quite sexist""

you might expect my argument to have been that they were being sexist towards women by saying they can't do something, actually i went the other way and said they were being sexist towards me for giving me less favourable and harder jobs for being a male

to an old conservative man in england, any notion being ""p.c"" must be like a slap round the face and he basically laughed me out the door

my response: 

absolutely. i will find him and figure this out. 

i'm just letting you know that i am refuting absolutely any claim that i have or had any intentions of quitting. 

thanks for letting me know

she responded with: 

play nice

she won't budge beyond that. she's a professional cya adherent. now i'm getting ready to go find him and point out that i am not quitting.

he knows that i am not quitting. barring mental illness, or chemical influence, he is aware i have not quit.

i've never dealt with an executive manager specifically angry with me to any level really. he clearly wants me gone and i'm blindsided by his actions. up until this morning i had been working on a proposal to the ceo that would create long term employment opportunities for myself with the company.☹️☹️


edit 3:  decided to email hr outlining the issue and requesting assistance. i'm not allowed on the work site until my supervisor is updated on my employment status. i'm taking this time to write a timeline of events leading up to this mornings message. i am also collecting any evidence of my intent to work today. 

i actually messaged several managers yesterday evening with instructions for the change over and offers to assist in any way.  i'm feeling pretty solid about the fact i haven't quit and not very solid at all on my future with the company. it just seems so petty and vindictive. this person is well known in our industry and is very qualified on paper. it just doesn't make sense to me. 

edit 4: i'm calling hr and hoping i'm allowed to work! i'm afraid that it's not over and that he will try to prove i quit, despite all evidence to the contrary. wish me luck!

"by getting way too distracted at the gas station by a smokin' hottie. this was actually several years ago, back when i was a young lad with my super sweet mitsubishi galant, a screw off attitude, and a penchant for the opposite sex (so, in other words, your standard dingbat teenager). 

i was heading to a friend's house to dink around, when i had to stop into a gas station to fill up on the way. this station was right on the side of the road, in a smaller residential type area, so it was really easy to pull in, fill up, and get right back out and on your merry way. just after i pulled up in my stock cherry red mitsubishi galant (really can't emphasize enough how normal and unimpressive my car was, even though i thought it was awesome), a stunning blond girl pulled up into the stall opposite mine, and proceeded to start to fill up her gas tank.

being the ultra cool, super suave teenager that i was, i winked at her, waved a sly little wave and gave her my signature smile. much to my chagrin, she just chuckled to herself and looked away, obviously not interested. 

so i thought, well-she's going to see exactly what she's missing after i peel out of the gas station, right onto the road, to show her that i am a total badass and someone who, in my stock 4 cylinder mitsubishi galant, obviously rides the line between civility and chaos (i know i've heard a comedian comment on this but seriously, i wasn't sure what i expected-that she would run towards my car, waving her hands, asking me to stop because she was so impressed? i dunno, teenage me was really dumb you guys). i hopped into my car, turned on the gas, and high tailed it outta there-and when i got almost to the curb, i heard a loud ""whomp"" followed by a ""clang clang clang slap slap"" on the right side of my car.

perplexed, i looked into my right side rear view mirror, to see the pump and most of the hose flapping merrily in the breeze. i stopped immediately, turned around, and drove back into the parking lot, all the while the blond haired goddess was in absolute hysterics, leaning on her car and, i thought i saw, tears rolling down her cheeks.

i took the pump and the hose into the gas station attendant, said ""uh... i think this belongs to you guys,"" and then walked out back to my car (the attendant looked absolutely dumbfounded, like he had just been slapped with a fish). the girl by this time had gotten control of herself, and i winked again as i passed by, as if to say ""see the kind of guy you could have had? this kind of a guy, who is an obvious idiot!""

to this day, i can't recall a more embarrassing single incident in my life. thankfully, it was in front of strangers and i of course never went back to that gas station again-but still, i hope you can all feel just a little bit better about yourselves, knowing that (likely) you have never been so brash as to try and destroy a gas pump trying to impress a member of the opposite gender.

tl:dr- my teenage, hormone addled brain forgot to take out the gas pump as i tried to impress an attractive blonde girl by speeding out of the gas station onto the road. she laughed so hard she cried as i took the dangling pump back into the attendant, and shockingly, she still wasn't interested in my scrawny, red-galant-driving self!

edit: rip my inbox, my top post of all time is my most embarrassing story. i couldn't be happier! thanks to all those that have said it made them laugh or smile, that was my original goal, hoping it would be seen by a few folks and brighten their day. so happy it went a little wider! and to those calling me out for being an idiot... yes! that's kind of the point of the story :p",4

example job posting: 

*need reliable, intelligent operations coordinator / event steward. our venue is a small friendly environment looking for an organized, outgoing, motivated individual with a flexible schedule to work events & some evenings and weekends will be required. you must have reliable transportation and a current driver's license, as some office errands will be required.* 

*job responsibilities will include:* 

•	*tear down & set up event space (may include stripping the room of all furniture, vacuuming & resetting the room).*

•	*maintain high standards of cleanliness & sanitation throughout the event function space which includes carpets, walls, walkway, tables, chairs, linen, etc.).*

•	*during events, duties may include assisting with refreshing the coffee, tea, water & attending to different needs.*

•	*packaging orders to ship & logging in receivables, locating orders, putting up inventory, ordering shipping supplies.*

•	*staying on track with ups orders for pickup & receiving.*

•	*light office work.*

&nbsp;

you are running out of money and desperate for some work, so you apply because it seems legitimate enough. plus, how can this be a scam? you send an email with your resume and lucky enough for you they respond. they say you sound like the perfect candidate and they have an upcoming event they need you to coordinate (they may even call you to make sure **you** are who you say you are). they mail you the event details and a $5,000 check. they say they need you to deposit this check and buy yourself a laptop or a desk or whatever you need to ensure you are prepared for the upcoming event and mail $3,000 of it to the event speaker. they say they need to make sure they can trust you and if you do this right, they'll continue to give you more work. you do this because after all they are giving you money, there is no risk to you.

this is where it all goes wrong.

you feel a bit uncertain but you deposit the check and wait about a week to make sure it clears. a few days after depositing it, you see the money is in your account. ok, it may be legit. you send the money to the event speaker via western union or whatever instruction your new boss have given you. a few more days later you're account is (negative) -$3,000. the reason is because this check was drawn off of a tiny bank in a tiny town. the amount of time to verify this check was longer than the amount of time that the funds are made available in your account. the reason for this is  because checks need to be verified from both banks. this can be difficult to do because of many factors (in this case it's a tiny bank that is difficult to get in contact with their clearing department) and large banks have their own fund availability policies. banks may choose to make funds available earlier to reduce the negative impact to customers. they are also restricted to how long they can hold funds due to the expedited funds availability act: regulation cc. 

tl;dr: you can deposit a check in your account and have it clear then have the money pulled out of your account days later because of how check clearing works. ",10
"for refusing to make my kid apologize?. so my mom has always been some what (okay a lot) of an authoritarian style parent.  there were a lot of time growing up where i didn't agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. and honestly even now, there are some of those times.

i love my mom, she's the strongest person i ever met.  but because of this i have never shared much of my personal life with her.  i try to open up more now, because i want an open relationship with her.  and, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she's still her own way.

well because of this i have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.

okay so let's get the background over... i'm a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. some severe and some mild.  including an array of food allergies. my mother babysits him while i am at work.  this generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.

well recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  it's complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  hives, itchy mouth, etc.  typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it's okay. but he has reacted to cooked too. so even though his epipen isn't for that specific food, we avoid it.  basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn't and he and i have decided together he won't. 

well mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  when he said no again she told him he was grounded from
screens all night until he cleaned his plate.  my son's reply was ""fine. i don't care how much trouble i'm in i am not eating that.  you can't make me.""

well of course my mom was livid when i got there to get him.  and she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.

i told her that i can't make him do that. i have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he's allergic to. no adult can make him poison himself. and i will 100% back that up.  

now mom is saying we are both ah's and need to apologize to her.  that she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are ""fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives."" 

so, aita? and was my son holey-jr?

"a reminder that nobody knows where the market is going, and trying to time the market is a fool's game. this is in response to a comment that was made exactly one year ago by /u/alienm00se:

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3pro4r/goodbye_middle_class_51_percent_of_all_american/cw90j8y/

he speculated that the market is headed for a crash, and it was a good idea to sell out of large caps over the next year and start investing in hedge positions to shield against the crash. he also speculated that gold is going to possibly drop to $850/ounce, and it would be a good buy when it drops below $1050. i set a reminder to see where we are a year later.

well, guess what happened? no surprise here. 

the closing price of the s&p 500 on 10/21/2015 was ~~$2018~~ $2052. 

the closing price on 10/21/2016 was $2141.

the s&p 500 is actually up ~~6%~~ 4.3% even after the tumultuous roller coaster ride we've had this year. certainly, ~~6%~~ 4.3% pales in comparison to the raging bull market we've had where we've seen it soar 20% in one year. however, it is still a decent return. periodically selling off during the past year would have resulted in missing out on those gains as well as possibly locking in some losses since we had a few months where the market fell and then rebounded.

gold did not go below $1050 once all year. the lowest it was all year was exactly $1050.80 on dec 17, 2015.(http://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html) today it is $1266. that being said, i still do not recommend gold as an investment(http://www.aaii.com/files/images/articles/9298-figure-1.jpg).

the most prudent advice is, as warren buffett recommends, invest in low-cost index funds, and invest long term.(http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/08/10/why-warren-buffett-thinks-putting-your-money-her-2.aspx)

"train your puppy to ring a bell you hang by the door so he/she can let you know audibly when they need to go outside.. i've done this with each of my dogs and it has worked wonderfully. it gives them a chance to audibly ask to go outside even when i'm not near the door. this in turn prevents scratching at the door (which can cause damage) and helps prevent accidents earlier on in life when potty training.

**edit: had requests about how to train this. here's how:**

it's all about the treats and praise! what i do is i start by ringing the bell and giving a treat. i do this for a while until i notice the dog has associated the sound with receiving a treat (they'll lick lips or run over to the bell or something similar once they get it).

then i'll ring the bell but make them go outside to get the treat (training them that bell rings, then you go outside, then you get a treat).

then i'll take their paw or snout and physically make them touch the bell. then we go outside and they get a treat. 

eventually they'll connect the dots. bell = outside. treats can be withdrawn as outside is a reward in and of itself (running in the yard, peeing, chasing a squirrel, etc).

"my wife and i bought our home a little over a year ago. today a lawyer came to our door and told us that the previous owners were in a lawsuit with the construction company that built the home. they settled and would like to split the settlement with us 50/50. does this sound legit?. this is a surprise and my wife and i aren't sure how to approach this. we are upset that we weren't made aware of this when buying the house. the settlement money is for construction defects of the house and we feel that since we bought the house from the previous owner, we should receive more of the monetary amount to go towards repairs.

the lawyer indicated to us that if we wish to receive more than 50% of the settlement, he would reimburse us from his firm . this is a class action lawsuit that includes 40 some other homes. he needs everyone's signature to receive the settlement from the construction company. 

my question is if this is legitimate?

is there a breach of contract somewhere with the previous owners or the real estate company since we weren't made aware of a pending lawsuit that would make clear construction defects of the home?

any advice would be appreciated.

it was a three night affair, and a male stripper came the last night we were there. becca's good friend, anna, got really into the stripper. i don't know anna very well- we've only met a few times, but she's nice and we get along great. anna is engaged and getting married sometime this winter (haha i don't know the date honestly). we're bridesmaids together. 

anna was even more about the stripper than the bride. when the stripper got naked, so did she. she was basically shoving her boobs at the guy. she licked whipped cream all over him. etc. which, you do you boo! she did mention to me her fiance probably wouldn't be ok with it. i chuckled awkwardly. please note that everyone was well aware of the stripper coming and in agreement - it's not something that was sprung upon anyone! another bridesmaid (neither me nor anna) arranged the stripper. 

last night was becca's wedding. the wedding was beautiful. at one point during the reception, i was (drunkenly) talking to anna, another friend, and anna's fiance. the other friend couldn't attend the party so we were all recounting our tales and laughing. i was very drunk at this point. i said ""and then anna took her clothes off! you should've seven her with the stripper!"" something to that effect. 

ummm... anna's fiance goes ""a stripper?!"" turns out he didn't know a stripper was coming at all. 

last i saw them, they were in a very heated conversation. :/ i apologized and anna said ""well now fiance is ready to call off our wedding so fucking thanks."" she is really upset. i feel bad. my husband said it's not my responsibility to uphold and remember her lies, especially when i'm drunk. my mom disagrees and says i should've been more discreet.

august 2016 i was arrested for stunt driving/excessive speeding. 

in aug 2017 i was given a conditional discharge and was put on a 1 year probation, prohibiting me from operating a motor vehicle and my license was suspended. during the probation period i didn't drive or in anyway operated any motor vehicle.

august 2018 i've completed my driving prohibition and probation. i reacquired my drivers license.

update 21st may 2019

i've been to the vancouver provincial court where my original offence was transferred to for some answers and apparently on their side i'm cleared from probation and the driving prohibition. i was also told to go check with my local court since my new charge was sent there. also applied for legal aid here.

i've been to my local court to ask about the new charge (18th may) and too see if they could help me clarify what is going on and they couldn't really help me. they say they would need the new charge to come to the court in order to make a clarification and apparently the file is still in transit and i should contact the transit police. 

then i've contacted the transit police and they say i would need to wait until my court date in august then the court will have the file.

thanks to everyone who commented on the last post. someone suggested i take the ring for a cleaning, and get an extra diamond or something added, instead of a new ring. i liked this suggestion and i was going to do it but i ended up taking a different route.

i ended up talking to my mom about it and what she thought. she said proposing with a new ring is a no-go because i already did that and she already has one. she said the ring should be the centrepiece. she also said i shouldn't propose empty handed because there needs to be a reminder of the day she said yes, instead of only a reminder of the rejected proposal.

so we ended up going shopping and i settled on a nice silver heart locket which she helped me pick out. it was very pretty and fairly inexpensive compared to the ring and i was really happy with it.

i sat on it for a while until the time felt right. we were watching tv on sunday night and having some wine and everything was really chill and it just felt right. so when i went to top up our glasses i grabbed the locket and i proposed to her on the lounge sofa. she cried, and she said yes :) i cried too and it was really beautiful and special.

"my (23f) husband (31m) shaved our cat for no reason. this is really fucking weird and i'm not sure what to do from here.

when i woke up this morning the cat had practically no fur. there are stubbly patches on her body, and the legs, head, and tail still have their fur but most of the rest is clean sheared off. i obviously asked my husband what the hell happened, we're the only people here and she's a strictly indoor cat.

he was very nonchalant. he said she was shedding too much and he was tired of the hair everywhere. so he just shaved her instead of brushing more or something? she's a short haired cat, and it's not shedding season either, there's really not that much hair. and even if that wasn't the case who shaves a cat? that does not sound comfortable for them and he could have easily injured her. i checked her over and her skin seems fine, but still!

i also asked how he did it. he first used a pair of scissors to cut the fur down, then used a heavy duty razor he ordered online. he never thought to mention wanting to do this, just went ahead and did it. (of course i would have shut the idea down if he'd brought it up)

then the other thing is a few weeks ago our downstairs neighbor's cat turned up shaved too. it's an outdoor cat. i saw it like that and asked the neighbor what happened, she said she had no idea. the cat usually roams around a lot but will come home a few times a day for food, and it had come back like that one morning. the neighbor told me she assumed it was kids or something. now i'm forced to wonder if my husband had anything to do with it because this was so bizarre and unnecessary to me. i have no actual proof, it's just a very strange coincidence. 

my husband doesn't want to talk about it and snapped at me to stop bugging him. he said it's not a big deal and that lots of people shave their cats. while i'm sure some people do i know it's not ""lots"".

i'm not happy about this. she's technically both of ours since we live together, but i've had her since i was 19 first living on my own. that was long before i met him and i still consider her ""my"" cat. i feel like he went and did something behind my back when it wasn't his decision to make... maybe that's dramatic.

when i got home and spoke to my boyfriend, i realized he actually *did* ask me to marry him. i would've said yes either way (if it was a joke or not) but i was just left feeling a bit.. disappointed and empty, i guess. i'm not the biggest fan of the ring either. it's big and chunky and uncomfortable to wear. it was meant to be sapphire to match my birthstone he said, but he 'accidentally' got the wrong colour. it's not my style and it doesn't suit me whatsoever. we've never looked at engagement rings together so he wouldn't know what i like. i mentioned this to him and asked if he would mind if i bought a smaller ring (with my own money) to wear instead but he got quite offended by that and called me ungrateful. he's been moody ever since. may i add that the ring he bought wasn't expensive, so it's not like he'd be wasting lots of money if i didn't wear it.

if you state you do not want to be transported or treated (and you can refuse either or both, it's up to you), the medics will have you sign paperwork stating that you are refusing treatment or transport, and will usually have a witness sign it too. this form is for their protection, not yours, but it's a double edged sword: it can be used to prove that you did not receive treatment in the (unfortunately likely) event that the ambulance company tries to bill you anyway. ask for a copy and if they can't give you one (usually they're on carbon paper, but not always) take a picture with your phone. this document is going to be your holy grail if they try to bill you erroneously- having proof of it could save you thousands of dollars.

both my kids already have educational savings accounts set up for them for college/university, and get regular presents. *anything else i should add/change about this?* he is also getting other gifts, but this is in my opinion one of the best ones that he probably won't fully appreciate until he's older.

**edit:** i went away for lunch, came back and this had gone bigger than expected. i am going to adjust the returns to be more realistic after reading the discussion. some feel i shouldn't make this part of his birthday as he might perceive he's been cheated a gift. he's not that sort of kid, and tends to get gifts for being awesome year round anyway. may post another update in 8-9 hours to report on how it was received. 

**update edit:** so the night of fun is over. he's upstairs having a blast with his presents, most happy with his new headset as was expected, and was interested in learning more about his savings present. as was expressed by many different people below, *your mileage may vary depending on the audience*. my 14yr was cool with it luckily.

"$65k stolen from my parents' bank account at wells fargo. supposedly this happened a few times this week, and the guy doing it knows what he is doing and hasn't been caught. 

the guy somehow got a hold of my dad's social security number, as well as account # and routing # at wf. he then masks his ip address through a vpn and sets up a new bank account at bank #2 (using social security # and personal details). he then uses the routing # and account # to transfer $65,990 out of wf to bank #2, then pulls all the funds out (i don't know how you pull it out without showing your face unless you transfer it again) and then closes the account. 

originally i thought this might have been an inside job with wf all over the news lately, but the police confirmed this same thing is happening frequently to many people. 

good news is, wells fargo is replacing all of the stolen funds...

edit: my dad was given this link with respect to identity theft & changing your ss #, has some upsides and very large downsides...

"tifu, not by giving 23 & me, but by convincing the family to complete their survey....hours later..... like many, i gifted my family with 23 & me dna testing kits. unlike the typical tifu's for the kits involving previously unknown infidelity and adoptions, my family was secure in knowing there'd be none of that.

but then we got to the surveys. oh, dear god, the surveys! 23 & me asks you to register your kits online. fine. then they ask you to answer some questions. sure. we can do that. ...or so we thought.

"out of town for business, my rental car was flagged as stolen weeks before i rented it resulting in a felony traffic stop involving 8 officers.. i'm in san francisco for work, and my wife flew out this weekend so we could visit napa. on the way there, we noticed an officer following us, and as soon as we got off our exit we were pulled over. three other squad cars blocked the off ramp and pulled their guns on us. they asked me to put our hands in the air, throw the keys out of the window, walk backwards, get on my knees, etc. they did the same with my wife and when we asked why this was happening they didn't answer. 

they put me in the back of the squad car, and read my rights to me. they then told me the car was stolen, to which i responded it was a rental. after some time they confirmed the paper work with the rental company, and cleared the plates. they explained that the company reported it stolen weeks ago when it wasn't returned on time, then never followed up with the police department. the officers explained that the city we were in has one of the highest crime rates in america which was why they had to take it as seriously as they did. we later confirmed that with locals as well as the good old internet. 

we've talked to multiple people who believe we should sue the rental company, because at the end of the day the officers were acting on the information they had and we were the wrong flinch away from being shot. would there actually be a case here?",2

"update (sc) neighbor cut down their tree so that it landed on our property and won't remove it.. original(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cyv1l0/sc_neighbor_cut_down_their_tree_so_that_it_landed/)

my post didn't get much attention but i figure i should post an update since it did get resolved in a favorable way.  this happened a couple weeks ago but i only had time to post this recently.

since everything we had seen suggested that criminal charges were a possibility, my mother contacted the police and they visited.  she told them about the criminal charges aspect and they said they'd ask the judge about it.  the judge said that this was a civil matter, and we thought that was pretty much the end of that and that we'd just have to go to small claims over this.

however, a removal crew showed up the next day, as if by magic.  our guess is that the neighbor decided we were serious about pursuing this when he saw the cop cars and decided to actually remove the trees.  i didn't really expect that, but i'm not going to complain about the issue being resolved at no cost to us.  we also discovered that the other tree they were asking us about may be a boundary tree when examining the property line, so we now know to keep note of that in the future.",2

"for planning on only getting one of my kids christmas gifts?. throwaway because some of my church friends know my main account. 

backstory: my husband and i have two kids (both teenagers). we raised our children to be christian (as is our faith), but also didn't want to force them into our religion so as soon as they turned 13 they were allowed to no longer come to church, participate in saying grace before meals, etc.. one of our kids has continued with church and their faith very adamantly. our other kid has come to church more sporadically and over the past half year or so has began to explore buddhism. more recently they have been telling us that they are no longer christian, but they are buddhists. while we are disappointed that they are no longer christian, i  believe everyone is entitled to their own religion and i am proud that my daughter is exploring her faith. 

current issue: at dinner recently we were talking about travel plans for christmas (we usually will rent a cabin somewhere for family time) and i mentioned that i wasn't planning to get our non-christian daughter any big gifts since her religion doesn't celebrate christmas. she was immediately upset. i told her that i would get her some little goodies so she didn't feel too left out, but that she shouldn't expect to partake in a religious holiday for a religion she doesn't believe in. she said (i'm so many words) it's not fair for us to spend money on our other child's gifts, but not her and that we were punishing her for not being christian. it doesn't make sense to me to give her gifts to celebrate the birth of jesus when she doesn't believe he is our savior. i told her if she really felt it were unfair, i would donate the amount of money i spent on our other kid to a charity of her choice in her name. she didn't like this either. my husband and i have since talked and he has very mixed feelings on the whole situation. 

aita?

edited to add: not sure if this matters, but i have made it clear to her that if she ever wanted to celebrate any holidays pertaining to her religion i would do my best and get her what she needs to celebrate. my goal is not to hinder her exploration of buddhism.

edited to add: i see a lot of comments about how christmas isn't a christian holiday and i agree that many families celebrate a very commercialized christmas. we (for example) do not involve santa in our celebration, but we do (for example) read from the bible and sing hymns. regardless of what others do, our family takes the holiday as an opportunity to celebrate and thank god for all that he has done and provided for us.

final edit (hopefully): i hear you all and i know i have a lot of reflection ahead of me. even though some of this is hard to read, i really do appreciate you all taking the time to respond. i think my family has a lot of discussion ahead of us and i specifically have some growth to do as a mother and christian. i also want to let those of you who have voiced concerns know that both of my children are loved by my husband and myself and that i plan on talking with my daughter (maybe even showing her this thread) about how i can do better by her.",3

so it's been an extremely rough couple of months and seems to only keep getting worse honestly and i'm sad to say there is no happy ending here. i didn't even want to do an update but so many people seemed to be interested in the original and update.

so where to start, still haven't found him and the legal help i have is really great but they are also very overworked and the resources needed to track him down just take time to get and more time to find him. as a final parting gift it seems he claimed our child on his taxes from last year so he could get that tax credit. i was hoping we could track him down that way but again sometime that takes time and resources. which technically since he was the one working and did live with us for over 6 months of the year he is technically entitled to in a legal sense.

the bank was somewhat kind of understanding during the holidays but the calls are getting to the point where i'm fairly certain they will begin foreclosure soonish i really don't know that for certain but when you don't pay a mortgage for 4+ months they get kind of upset and the circumstances don't matter.

finally managed to get on snap for food and it helps a lot but it's crazy how quickly you realize how much food you eat and your kid eats and before when money didn't really matter for necessities like food, soap, water bills and electricity.

i managed to get a job that somewhat works for childcare hours but you quickly start to realize childcare costs as much as you make so it's like working so you can pay you have your kid watched. trying to avoid paying all the bills attached to the house i can so i can save up enough to hopefully get us the smallest cheapest apartment around and keep working.

sorry for the negative update everyone but it's just life i guess. unless things extremely and drastically change for the better this will be the last update. i'll keep doing my best of course and thanks for all the kind words in the other posts about the other updates.

"i(m43) had a child with my best friend(f40) and my girlfriend(f45) can't cope with it. my best friend jen and i had a child 10 years ago. no one of us had found a life partner and jen was diagnosed with something that would soon leave her infertile. we decided that we were going to have a kid together and i offered to pay for the ivf because i was the one from a wealthy family.

we had our beautiful baby boy and have been happy ever since. we haven't slept together or anything. we live in the same house. but the house is separated in 2 apartments with a big inside patio on the first floor.

this living arrangement works for us and we can raise our boy in a functional family.
3 years ago jen met roger who is an awesome guy and father of a daughter. so we do have a patch work family. roger is a good bud of me yada yada.

one year ago monica and i got together. i was very upfront about my living situation. and she said she was okay with is. monica herself has 2 kids that i really do like very much.

so now to the problem.
monica was really nice to jen in the beginning. but i have been noticing that she is being more passive aggressive towards her. when we have big family outings, meaning taking all the kids to the zoo or a park, monica does her best to alienate us from the group.

she gets mad when she comes to my place and jen and i are sitting on the couch watching some sort of cop show. we don't even cuddle we just share a couch.

she gets mad when we take our son to a family trip to a theme park alone because she says it's weird.

she got super fucking mad when i was walking down with monica to help her pack her car and placed a hand on her back because i was ""inappropriately touching another woman"".

i love monica and i have tried to be reassuring that, despite me having a child with jen, i don't feel any sort of attraction toward her.

she has been pressuring me to move out which i don't want. the city we live in, is very expensive and the house i live in is all paid for. it's 2 apartments we have full privacy from each other. jen and roger also do their thing. i know this is a weird situation. but i have never tried to hide it. i have always been very honest about everything and also honest about my intentions to not moving.

monica hasn't talked to me in days and i wonder if this relationship has run its course or if i have a shot at repairing it?

edit : sorry i am bad at conveying stuff. so we don't spend every free second with jen. this family weekends are like once a month when roger has his kid ans monica hers. there we tend to splurge on theme parks, aquariums etc. but ofcourse when monica comes over she doesn't have to spend time with jen. as said we have different appartements in the same house. while the doors are unlocked for our sons sake we only spend time in the other apartment when we watch something together or sometimes have family dinner. which isn't everyday. so we have our privacy.

edit2: the reason why jen and i knoe that there are no feelings is because before having our son we talked about it. having a child in a couple that had o sided feelings would not have worked. we came to the conclusion that no one of us had seen the other at any point in a romantic light.",7

"tx i am the non-custodial parent of a 3yo whose mom just went to prison and is now living in a drug den. final update!. dear friends, its been 57 days since my first post looking for advice, and my what an adventure(https://redd.it/5nz4yw) it has been! you people have been as big a part of this as our own family (who knew that kids tugged at reddit's heartstrings so much!), and as promised, here we are at the exciting conclusion:


* my lawyer called in a personal favor to the judge to expedite the final orders hearing as much as possible, it only took three weeks from the temporary hearing to today when we had our final; which apparently is warp speed versus the norm. 
* the mom's mom made a huge personal sacrifice by testifying, but she did, and painted a truly sad picture of what things were like before we came into the mix. we even discovered that now, while she is in prison, the mom is pregnant again and used meth intravenously the whole time until she was locked up in december.  so when she pops this one out and the baby's poop tests positive for narcotics, the state is likely to take it away. addiction is a cruel mistress. we have gotten close to grandma and we plan to keep her close. she has always taken care of him when she was able to and really put her neck out on the line to look out for her grandson's well being. 
* we were granted **all** of our terms, everything! this includes a discretionary visitation claus, that basically says me and my son have to mutually agree to allow her to visit. i will not be unfair to the mom or abuse this flexibility, but it gives me a lot more leverage to require that she is clean and set healthy boundaries. 
* and here we are, a new and very happy family of three and we love the shit out of our little man (even though he is for some reason screaming about jurassic world right now). we aren't perfect, and we are winging it at best, but we are going to bust our asses forever to give our son the life he deserves.

"by accidentally having sex with my cousin at a family wedding. so i originally posted this to r/confession a couple nights ago, and thought here might also appreciate the story. obligatory: this fuck up did not happen today, but nearer to two years ago. 

as a disclaimer: this is my first reddit post and on mobile so apologise for formatting yada-yada-yada. 

so this happened about 18 months ago, or somewhere in the vicinity of 18-20 months. i still get flak from this from both family and friends. 

so, the setting: my uncle's wedding. it's around autumn and my uncle by my mothers side, from an exceptionally large family (this is relevant), is getting married for the second time. now my family is very large. my mother has 3 brothers and 5 sisters. all with children of their own, and some even with children of their own now. 

the wedding isn't what i would describe as large, pretty much encompassing just family and close friends. all in all, there can't have been more than 50 or 60 people there, and around 60% (at a rough estimate) or so are related by blood to me. they make up the majority is what i'm trying to say, and many are spread over whom i have only briefly met, or in some cases, never met. well, you can see where this is going. 

for reference, i would be around mid 17 in this story, with the age of consent in my country (uk) being 16. the girl, who we shall call isla, was 22 or 23. 

well, at the reception, i am having a good time with my sister, parents and cousins. dancing, heavily indulging in drinking etc. just generally enjoying myself as it is rare for large family gatherings for us for obvious reasons. 

a girl i don't recognise begins to dance with me on the (very crowded) dance-floor. she's older than me clearly, but i thought maybe 19 or 20. anyway, we start dancing, touching etc. she twerks on me a little, i grind a bit and i presume nobody noticed due to accumulated intoxication and crowdedness around where we were. one things leads to another, we start kissing and she asks me if i want to go 'upstairs', which i correctly take to mean her room in the hotel (it was a hotel wedding). 

i, of course, being a hormonal teenage boy (still am), jump at the opportunity and say yes. i should say this wasn't my first time or anything and by this point i carried condoms around in my wallet when i went out and knew i would be drinking. 

so we proceed to discreetly (or so i think) take our leave. both drunk, obviously, but not to the point of not being in control of our actions, or stumbling around/blackout etc. i get to her room, a bit of excited talk, and clothes come off. all is going well. now, i should say that all this time i'm assuming this girl is a relative (or perhaps friend?) of the bride. oh boy. i was in for a shock. because, as it turns out, she thought the same of me. 

as we were 'cleaning up', so to speak, we begin a little small-talk when before had mostly just been purely sexual. she eventually asks how i know the bride (let us call her emma). i stop. thunderstruck. the realisation slowly creeping up on me and oh, the horror. i laugh it off (hoping, in vain) she is joking and state i am the son of (insert mothers name). the shock is palpable on who i then realised as my cousins face as she was putting her bra back on. she sort of freaks out and says she's the estranged daughter of one of my uncles who's had a troubled life, whom she had very recently reconnected with (i did not know this). we essentially collectively let out a 'fuckkkkk'. 

from there we got dressed quickly and decided to never reveal this major cock-up to a soul and hope to god we had not been noticed (alas). we decided it would be best if she were to leave first, and that i would follow around 5-10 minutes later. 

well i do. she leaves first, and i just kind of stand around in the hallway on my phone freaking out for a short while until i decide enough time has passed to erode suspicion. 

well, first thing i see when i get down is the look of pure disappointment on my mothers face, the stupid fucking grin on my fathers and half my cousins faces and my sister looking in disgust, as though she was watching a particularly repulsive sea-slug. one of my cousins whom i am close to pats me on the back, shaking his head and laughing his absolute head off. i know i am defeated then and quietly take a seat expecting the utter bollocking i will later receive from my family. my elderly 90 year old grandmother was there for fucks sake. and word was not quiet. i didn't see isla or her father again that reception and later found out she told him and he took her home, not to the hotel she had booked, by way of taxi.

so yeah. i accidentally took part in (protected, thank-god) incest. it is brought up at every, and i mean every, family-gathering. a couple of my cousins have taken to playing 'sweet home alabama' and asking when the next date is whenever i enter the room. 

after (soberly) explaining to my parents it was an accident and i fully believed she was not a relative (like they should have questioned it) they were okay-ish with it, but still disappointed and annoyed a little. my father asked me how i'd failed to notice isla (apparently) sat literally the row behind us, and i had no answer. gotta work on my observation skills i guess. not only do my family still tease me, but my friends found out from my sister within days and i've been relentlessly teased by them at most social gatherings since. you can imagine how many cousin/incest/alabama jokes daily. 

i am ashamed to this day. even more so because she is an objectively attractive woman. as one might imagine, the limited interactions we've had since have been extremely strained and awkward, not helped by my dickhead cousins. there is another big family wedding coming up this summer, and since the announcement 'the incident' as it's come to be known as has been all that's been discussed within my hearing.

anyway, i hope you all enjoyed that rollercoaster. if you have any questions feel free, and once again, do forgive the surely egregious formatting as i am just popping my reddit virginity with this story, which i've been encouraged to (anonymously) post online by friends so as to make you all laugh as much as them.

tl;dr i had sex with my uncles estranged daughter at a family wedding my first time meeting her. everybody in the (large family) knew then, and now, and will never let me live this down.

"by washing my car. this happened aver the course of this afternoon. my apartment block has a shared carpark with no assigned lots so everyone just parks where there is space. so its a sunny day and i decide to go down to wash my very filthy car. i've got two pails of water which i have to lug down from my unit, my wax, chamois cloth etc etc. i walk up to my car and start soaping it up then i rinse and wipe off the water.  i apply a nice layer of wax and then work on the rims. after a good hour or so of detailing the car i realise my neighbor is standing behind me. i look up at him and smile saying ""what a good job eh?"" and he goes ""yeah it is great job. thanks. what do i owe u for it"" as he unlocks the door. it takes me a good moment before i realise i've spent the good part of the afternoon cleaning my neighbor's identical car... i had thought it was that dirty but hadn't realized anything else was amiss as we have the same interior and same rims.... and now i've got a super burn and a still filthy car. 

tl;dr washed my neighbors identical car by accident....

edit: woah shit this blew up while i was asleep. thank you kind stranger for popping my reddit gold cherry!

edit 2: okay, so yes a major part of the f up is that i did not check either the license plate or unlock the car doors. i have two toddlers. cleaning up the interior is a challenge in its own right. a man has a right to clean rims even if the car is filled with peanuts.

edit 3: didn't take the payment. i know the guy. we know we have the same car. we joke about it and the wives are annoyed as heck lol.

edit 4: i clean the car interior and exterior separately, so no i don't open the doors. i hand wash to save water and money . i use a pressurized watering can to lather the soap on, then rise off with water and sponge. toothbrush for rims, squiddgie for windows.

so fast forward to last night, and i start to use this wand on my clit and notice that its a little too intense, so i turned down the speed, but that was even more intense as it felt like a harder vibration and started to really hurt. i put it back up to the highest vibration and kept it there as it did start to feel good, but also still hurt. well my husband and i start having sex while i'm still using this thing and it. feels. amazing. after 20 or so ""yes yes yes yes"" 's we both finished and i staggered off to the bathroom to clean the wand.

and that's when i saw it, blood all over the head of the wand. i start to panic, then i inspect my clitoral area and find the skin on and around my clit is busted open. i'm crying while blotting it with toilet paper and asking myself why i ever bothered with this stupid wand. now i'm in pain and too embarrassed to phone a doctor about it.


tl/dr: ignored pain a massager wand caused me, busted skin on and around my clit open.

"i ran a self-experiment where i went from using only cash to only credit.. for the past 11 months i ran a self-experiment where i first went from using only cash whenever possible (and debit online), to always using credit cards (and paying them off in full).  using ynab, i tracked all my spending and planned out a budget every month before that month began.  the result:

through credit cards, i earned $395.23 in 2-5% cash back but also spent 19% more overall compared to cash (resulting in a loss).  the biggest differences were:

* **pain vs. pleasure.**  whenever i used a credit card, because a part of me would think about cash back, it was fun.  even though i was buying something, it felt like i was getting free money.  yet because that feeling simply did not exist when using debit, purchases felt more like losses and uncomfortable.

* **convenience.**  the credit cards were undoubtedly easier to use so i spent more on food delivery (mostly ubereats) and at vending machines.  surprisingly, simply not wanting to get cash from an atm was enough to prevent me from getting delivery, and not wanting loose change stopped me from using vending machines.

* **restaurants.**  similar to the first point, because i knew i was going to be using debit i was more mindful of the cost.  yet due to that almost subconscious part of me that would think about free money with credit cards, i was simply more likely to feel ""this is fun"" and order based on emotion.

while i am well aware that my self-experiment is not at all scientific (there could be other reasons why i spent more on credit), i am surprised at the result because i've been budgeting and using credit cards for years.  i have consistently had $150 budgeted every month for restaurants for example, and while with credit cards i would think, ""i still have $x left to spend,"" with debit i just didn't want to.

it's incredible how subtle and yet powerful the lure to use credit cards can be.  i suppose i could just have better self-control, but i have zero debt, live below my means, and did this experiment for almost a year, so i think i have pretty good self-control anyway.

"i m/31 just caught my girlfriend (now ex)f/32 redhanded cheating on me with her ex.. needless to say i'm crushed.  i felt something was about 4 months ago, sex diminished greatly (we had sex 4 times in the last 4 months) she seemed more distant, she would get mad at me over petty things, she was a hawk over her phone, she would randomly stop texting me some night and tell me the next day she fell asleep.  we are talking 730-830 pm ""falling asleep"". the straw that broke the camel's back was this past sunday she said she was setting boundaries and she wanted one day to herself a week when she doesnt have her kid.  she also said she'd let me pick the day so i felt comfortable with it. 
that felt really weird to me. 
tonight, she came over and left early saying she had a headache.
about 20 minutes after she left a friend called me and said he by random chance saw her pulling into another guys driveway (friend knew where she lived and that a guy lived at the house she pulled into, small town).
he gave me the address and i immediately left my house.  
i arrived, banged on the door, no answer, bang again,  no answer.  finally.... her ex answers the door... in his underwear.
i asked, ""is kendra here?"" he responds, ""yes, who are you?""
i reply, ""her fucking boyfriend, did you know about this?""
he said he didnt know.
i said, ""if you knew about this, then you two deserve each other, if not then i'm sorry you had to find out this way.""
turned around and left.

i'm so heartbroken.  i thought when i met her that i'd be able to trust someone finally. 6/6 of my exes have cheated on me.  that's not assumed, its confirmed.  they've either admitted it, or i've caught them.

i'm so lost.  i'm to the point where i believe everyone cheats.  i dont know what's wrong with me.  i feel so worthless and low.  i dont know what i need to fix to make people stop cheating on me, i've tried so hard to figure it out.  i feel ugly and hopeless.

the last things i've texted her since i went there were, ""you're a worthless piece of shit."" 
""how can someone be so nice to your face while they stab you in the back"". (that was something she told me just a few days prior talking about her ex cheating on her with prostitutes) you're a joke.
thank you for destroying any trust i'll ever have in a human.  you're fucking scum.""

that was probably too much.  i'm not gonna say anything else to her, there's no point, i doubt she cares enough to respond.

i'm so broken right now, i dont think i can ever trust another person, i'm pretty sure every person cheats.

"large unleashed dog attacked my 7mo old puppy la,ca. please keep in mind that i was not actually present during the attack since i was at work.

my mother was walking my 7mo old pomeranian (3.6lbs) puppy on a leash around her friends neighborhood when an unleashed dog (estimated 80lb) rushed out of nowhere and attacked my puppy. the large dog flipped my puppy over and pinned her down. my dogs fur is completely coated in spit.

my mother told me the man ran out yelling at his dog while exclaiming that his did not bite my puppy. (i am not sure how he knew that his dog did not bite her) this was at around 4:30pm.

unfortunately my mother did not request this man's information under the impression that my puppy was just incredibly frightened and scared. my puppy was not bleeding and there were no signs of puncture wounds. however, her fur was covered in the older dog's saliva as mentioned earlier. the man and the large dog left the scene. we presume that this man lives in the neighborhood.

i came home from work at 5:50pm and my mother told me what happened and mentioned that my puppy was acting strange. i did research and noticed my dog was exhibiting signs of shock such as: cold paws, she won't stand, won't eat or drink, labored breathing and pale gums/tongue by this time it was now around 6:30pm. i drove her to the nearest emergency animal hospital at 6:53pm where she was admitted. 

my heart dropped when i heard the news from the vet. they did some quick scans and mentioned she is has fluid in her chest cavity from blunt force trauma from the prior dog attack. the vet also informed me that she is in critical condition and that she would need to be kept for approximately 48hrs for testing and further care. 

the total vet bill is expected to be $6143.15 in treatment.

due to my puppy's critical state they are not sure if she will even survive!

i am probably jumbling things up and not making much since because i'm in utter shock. i tried my best to write down what i know without attaching my own emotions in my post. i'm so unbelievably angry that my puppy may die due to a man who cannot supervise or control his dog.

my mom is driving back to the neighborhood (7:40pm)  to try to locate the man and his dog to tell him what happened, to get his information and to show him the vet bills. 

i'm not sure on what to do and if the man will even offer to pay for vet bills due to the high costs. i don't want to think about it but i do not know what to do if she were to pass away due to her injuries. i just got my puppy a few months ago and i saved $2400 to purchase her from a reputable breeder.

i need some advice on how to proceed with this matter. i assume i need to file a report to the city animal control, but do i also need to file a police report?

i'm very shaken and don't know what to do. please lend me some advice reddit.

edit: this is my first post on reddit so please let me know if i broke any rules or forgot information. thank you for your understanding.

update: just got an update from the vet. the prognosis is worse than originally predicted. internal bleeding from blunt force trauma from either the liver or spleen. vet costs will be more expensive.

update 2: got in contact with the man with the dog. he is getting a lawyer. costs are too high and we are deciding to put my puppy to sleep.
——————————————————————

update 3: the vet suggested blood transfusions due to her anemia and internal bleeding (ruptured liver/spleen) but mentioned it would have a low success rate. 

they will be refunding part of the costs because they did not perform all the listed surgeries on the care plan sheet. we are awaiting the final costs. 

saying goodbye was extremely hard because she perked up a few times like she was ok when she saw me. puppy has been put to sleep. i'm a wreck. 

the man mentioned we can't ""prove"" that his dog caused the damage and also told my mother he doesn't understand/put value on dogs and even can't imagine spending more than $500 on surgery for even his own wife. we took a picture of his dog, and now have his information. 

the vet will give us a detailed report on their findings to present to the man with the dog.",2

"for being open about my economic status among pushy coworkers?. i work at a small tech company where it's basically split between designers and project managers. i'm the admin assistant, so i do a little bit of everything until we find out what i'm good at. the others in the company come from much different experiences and life backgrounds than me. on the pm side, it's mostly women, and they love to talk about all the things they buy, travel, etc. 

one of them pulled me into a conversation about travel and said we should all bring in passports to compare places we've been. i said ""oh, i've never had a passport."" she was shocked, asked me why not. i just said ""oh, i can't really afford to travel."" she looked confused and asked about when i was growing up, where would we go on family vacations. i said we didn't and changed the subject. she kept looking at me weird after that.

then came the purse thing. i've carried the same bag with me for about 6 years. one of the girls laughed at a fraying strap and said it was time for a new one, and suggested this brand i'd never heard of that kind of matched the style. i looked it up and said ""that's a really nice one! but wow, $150 for a purse!"" she looked at me funny and said ""do you think that's a lot...?"" i said yes, that's basically two weeks groceries for me. she was very taken aback.

the ""inciting"" incident happened last week. one of the women recently started the process of buying a house. she's really excited and got her a nice candle. one of the women said that i was next, and i just said ""haha, yeah right!"" one of the women asked when i thought i'd start looking, and i was honest and said that i don't really see home ownership as a part of my life. they were all shocked and kept trying to tell me why i was wrong, and i admit i got a little annoyed when they wouldn't drop it. i said ""with what money?""

it got awkward after that, and the next day one of the women pulled me aside and told me that they're sick of the way i always have to be a downer about money, and that i always make it awkward when i talk about what i can't afford. i said ""well, how do you think it makes me feel to have you guys constantly flaunting all the purses and high end makeup and designer clothes you're wearing."" she said that they were bonding, that's what women do, and that from now on, i should try to be more discrete about the income disparity between us. 

i said ""sure, if you guys will be, so will i."" she gave me a look and said that i'm acting kind of like an asshole and punishing them for something that's not their fault. i told her that she was certainly entitled to that opinion, but that i think it's tacky to brag about all of the lavish things you can buy. she got pretty upset at that and now just one of the pm girls talks to me. aita?",3

"a cautionary tale for young students and letting your parents handle your student loans. i hope this has been covered here before but i wanted to share my experience to try and help others from going down the same path.

rule 1) the most important thing to remember is to never trust anyone when it comes to money and yes, this includes your own family. always know your financial status, especially if you are going to be the one footing the bill later.

rule 2) manage your own financial aid while in school. i know it is more work and sometimes it can be too much to take if it is your first time but this gives you experience in handling loans and you will benefit from this later. plus, you know exactly what you are in for once you graduate. need assistance? that's what the financial aid office is for. only involve others when it is an absolute must and for god sake don't give your financial login info to your parents or anyone else for that matter.

if you follow these simple rules, you should be able to avoid the mess i have gotten myself into.

now story time:

while in school, my parents took it upon themselves to manage my money. they made sure i had my school expenses covered and that i had enough overage to cover my living costs, etc. i thought all was fine. i mean i did struggle sometimes at the end of a semester where i ran out of cash, but they would eventually give me a little ""help"" to get me through (keep this in mind, it becomes important later). i did find it odd that anytime i asked about my financial situation, they would give me an excuse and would never really let me take a look, but, i mean, they are trustworthy, right? i mean they raised me after all. boy was i wrong

fast forward to graduation (2010).

loans are coming due and i have no job. so, i didn't really push my parents about getting my loan info. however, whenever i did, i thought something was odd since my parents tried to hide some of my loan information from me or they just wouldn't give it to me. they said not to worry about it though and that they were taking care of them and would start to pay them back for me.

at this point, the grace period is up for my loans. i push my parents for my student loan info. they finally give it to me, turns out, they haven't made a single payment and i am overdue for all of my loans. they say i need to get my shit together and get these loans under control. this is typical for my parents, being a root cause and blaming others, so i didn't really think that much about it.

i did finally get most of it ironed out and figured out i was close to $90,000.00 in debt. now, at first, i just normalized this and thought everyone graduated with this much debt over their heads (in state public uni). i mean, it did take me 5 years to graduate after all.  so, i stopped looking into my loans and just started paying them.

fast forward to present day.

here i sit, about 8 years after graduating. still in debt and still piecing the puzzle together of why i owe so much. there were some red flags that i should've caught but didn't. however, recently, i found out about nslds, the national student loan database. i highly recommend using this. from here, i found out that i did have grants that covered most of my college tuition. furthermore, i found that my parents, including grant money, took out over $25,000.00 per semester for my last year. after covering the semesters tuition, books, and rent, it still set me up for over $2,000.00 a month in spending money. remember when i said i ran out of money at the end of the semester? yeah, that should've never happened.

it turns out, they were pocketing most of the overages.

now, i know this looks bad but really, it's because it is.  my parents were going through a financial hardship at the time (dad was laid off). however, this never gives anyone the right to take money from you. they pretty much made their problem my problem.

the issue is, in my opinion, your family is more apt to take advantage of you than anyone else. they have already gained your trust and you look to them for life advice and guidance for most of your childhood. this is where i messed up, i should've never put that much trust into anyone.

however, the fault is both ways. from what i have seen, parents, in particular, are even more apt to take advantage. they tend to justify it to themselves fairly easily. for example, when they originally did this, they most likely thought this would get them by until they were able to pay my student loans. they kept telling me that they wanted to help me pay and that they wanted to pay for my college....they just seem to over estimate what their financial future will look like and have never been in a position where helping me was an option. now, here i am suffering from their lack of money management competence.

if i was more willing to deal with my student loans myself, this would have been something that i could have immediately caught. i mean, how hard would it have been to see that much in overages?

in conclusion, just don't trust people with money. they may have good intentions at the time but that's all it turns out to be. be vigilant. know what your expenses are and only take what you need and finally, if someone is taking care of your loans for you and won't send you an overview immediately when asked, you should stop everything and figure out what is going on.

i used to be one of those people who were always saying, i would hate to be one of those people who's own parents screwed them over....turns out i was one all along. the student loan racket just makes it too easy for parents to take advantage. don't let this happen to you. no matter how much your parents say they support you, your paperwork could say something different. money is just a special niche and makes people do things they may not have done otherwise or things they ""think"" they can correct before anyone would notice.

edit 1: a lot of people are saying i am making large generalizations that don't apply to most situations. that's the point. i know i am. it may not apply and i didn't think it would apply to me either. it is why i am in this mess and why this is a cautionary tale. not only does doing your own financial aid help you understand and better manage your loans after graduation. it helps you from people, as close as they may be, from taking advantage. so, really, you are the one that benefits.

other than that, i am sorry for anyone else who has been in the same situation. good luck to you! however, this has really opened my eyes to just how rampant this is. all the more reason to take care of it yourself.

edit 2: wow. i was really not expecting this but thank you all for the support! for all of the speculation out there, no, i do not have a relationship with my parents anymore, other than the occasional visit once every year or two. and yes, of course this is fraud. however, as others have stated, with student loans it is a niche thing. it is not as black and white as if they just took a regular loan out in my name. i wish it was but it is just not. this is the point of this post. i would never wish for anyone to be stuck in the situation that i am. i have made my mistakes, i just want people to learn from them, that's all. 

as far as any remaining questions go, i will try and answer them but this was way more than i could've ever imagined so it might take me a little time.  ",10

"by epilating my scrotum..  

before i start i have to say that this didn't happen today, was a few weeks ago, hope this is ok.

i hopped out of the shower, and started rummaging through the bathroom vanity drawers to find a razor, to shave my face. that's when i saw it, a pink pouch with a drawstring at the top, about the size of an iphone. curiosity got the better of me, and i opened the pouch, to find my wife's epilator. i clicked as to what it was straight away. gave it a quick flick on, as you do, and turned it off again.

that's when the light bulb went off - i could use this to turn my sack silky smooth! propping one leg up on the bath edge, i flicked the epilator on and got down to work. the first pass was a great success - a slight stinging as a few straggly hairs were plucked out, but not too bad.

the second pass, well, that's where it all turned south. it all happened in the blink of an eye, but this is what i believe happened, based on the aftermath: i went in again, only this time, my pube follicles were more resilient. the spinning drum off death grabbed a couple of hairs, however they would not part ways with my scrotum. i looked down in confusion, to see my hand holding the handle of the epilator. where the business end of the epilator shoud've been, though, there was only tightly stretched, inflamed, hairy ballsack. i gasped in pain, dropping the epilator, which swung pendulously between my thighs, only furthering the agony. sitting on the bath's edge, i located the epilator and lifted it into sight. my sack had been pulled into the drum, completing a full revolution, so that none of the drum was visible. the elasticity of the male scrotum truly is something to behold.

i gingerly unraveled my sack, a fraction of a turn at a time. after fully extracting it, my scrotum was covered in hundreds of tiny abrasions, as if it had been dragged along the sidewalk, if you can picture that. it also had about three hairs less than before i took a shower.

i later recounted this story to my wife, who was typically unsympathetic. as i finished recounting this woeful tale, she blurted out ""what the fuck did you expect? duh?!"", only rubbing further salt into the scrotal wound.

"michigan teen staying with us for past 8 months. how to get him emancipated or get custody of him?. 
edit: thank you all, thank you so much for the advice you've given me and for the outpouring of love for my husband,ian, kevin and me. thank you for the numerous private messages i recieved, and for the multiple offers i got to open up a gofundme for our legal fees. fortunately my parents and in laws who took kevin in as easily as we did already offered to help us pay for all of that, but thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindness and empathy.

after some recommendations from commenters, we contacted our local lgbtq center and shelter to do the right thing at the right time. we will meet with them and their lawyer tomorrow, and they already gave us 2 recommendations for family law attorneys they worked with. we will then proceed as our attorney sees fit, and i will update you on kevin's fate. thank you all so much, you are a great community. keep on loving.


last year my son ian, 15 befriended a new kid at school kevin, 15. on nye, ian asked us if kevin could spend the night because his parents were out of town and he didn't want to be alone. the next morning, kevin left but came back 2 hours later asking ian if he could stay one more night. it wasn't a problem for us. after the third night kevin stayed at our place we asked to call his mother to check she was okay with him staying. he said she didn't care and refused to answer when we pressed further. atfer a bit of debating, we took ian aside and told him we didn't mind kevin staying but if he had run away from home we should know and let his mother know he was safe. ian then told us that kevin's mother had threw him out and didn't want him to come back. ian wouldn't say why so we asked kevin to join us and told him unless he told us the whole story he couldn't stay because we didn't want to be liable for anything.

well in the fall kevin fell in love with another boy, and he decided that nye was a good time to tell his parents because he wanted to start the new year by being himself. his parents didn't take the news well and told him ""get the fuck off my house"". he then spent the night at our house thinking they were in shock and went back the next morning to talk to them. they didn't change their mind and forbade him from going back, saying he would rape and corrupt his young brother and he was no longer their son and wouldn't be until he found his way back to the ""right path"". he started crying when telling us the story so we left him alone. i asked for his mother's number which he gave me and i called her saying kevin was at our place and could we talk to them to see if things could get better. she basically told me to fuck off and to keep her ""sick deviant son"" or to just put him on the streets and forget about him.

of course i wasn't about to do that. so i asked if we could come get some of his stuff like clothes and school material. we went there (just my husband and me) and while we gathered kevin's belongings, she kept insulting him and his homosexuality and telling us we would rot in hell for helping him. my husband told her to shut the fuck up and we came home to the boys.

kevin has been with us since then. we kept sending his mother texts and pictures and updates in hope she would change her mind and realise that her son needs her. we were waiting for her to come back and take him back and be a fucking parent. so we just let time slip and didn't do anything. we treated kevin as our son and grew to love him as such.

last week was his birthday. we threw a party with friends and family and invited his parents. during the day, kevin got a text from his mother saying : ""15 years ago i gave birth to a son and today i wish i didn't. you live in sin. i can no longer call you my son as i can't have love for a twisted human. i wish you no harm but i don't wish you happiness and as long as you think it is normal for a man to love another man,  you will no longer be part of the family. enjoy living with the sinners you belong to"".

as soon as kevin showed us the text my husband was in the car to go see her. she told him basically the same thing. either we keep kevin or we throw him out, she doesn't care. there is no doubt, from the multiple times we tried to talk to her, that she won't change her mind. we asked kevin what he wanted to do, and we had a meeting with his therapist (we sent him to therapy around february because he started cutting himself, refused to eat or leave his room). kevin wants to be free of his mother.

so my question is, what are the steps? can he be emancipated? can we get legal custody of him? can we adopt him? we always had hope his parents would change his mind but after his birthday we know they won't. we love kevin as if he were our son and we don't want him to suffer any more than he already has suffered. my husband and i are not educated when it comes to the law and we are at lost. any advice will be more than welcome. thank you.

"texas school sent a letter that our atheist student club will not be permitted this school year. invited us to join christian clubs instead.. i'm 16 years old. in the last couple of years me and a friend founded an atheist student club in our school to provide a non-religious alternative to the christian clubs that already existed. last year we had 22 members. we are the only specifically non-religious club. this is a public school.

the letter says that the club is banned from the school in the coming school year due to the complaints from the parents that the club is encouraging lifestyle that they find unacceptable for their children. we do not bully or troll people. we just do what other clubs do without being religious. we accept all people and have no condition on atheism. last year we had a muslim and a pagan student and everyone loves it.

the complaints are from the parents who don't like that their kids are not as religious as they are. we had a few members whose parents were very religious but they were not. last year they complained but school took our side. i guess this year they gave in.

i went to the school today and talked to the assistant principal who said that they can't ignore complaints from parents and told me to forget about this.

i'm not a lawyer but doesn't the first amendment protect our right to freedom of and from religion? i don't think they can just say they can ban us because some parents don't like the atheist lifestyle.

first is the law on our side? and if so what resources i can use to fight the school's decision? my parents will not pay for a lawyer. ",2

"why my phones touchscreen sometimes registers a touch when in reality my finger is millemeter or two from screen?. my guess is static electricity since it only happens once in a while and randomly but i am hoping for more insightful explanation.

edit:
it also usually happens in the middle of typing. it never happened, for me, on first letters i typed. and, i am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. when it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. it is always unexpected.

edit2:
i can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones i am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. a lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings. so, there is a small chance that i am imagining it.

"having a child with a severe mental disability is an irrational choice and a huge burden, and people who talk about how much they grow and appreciate from the experience are delusional.. parents who choose to raise a child with a severe mental disability like down's syndrome  are making a terrible mistake from any rational perspective: they're committing to investing the rest of their lives in someone who may never be fully independent and will never reach the full potential that a mentally normal person will. this choice is especially terrible for families with other children: having one child who requires enormously more time and effort than the others is preposterously unfair and will drag on the other children for the rest of their lives.

that said, many people claim to find immense happiness, the true meaning of love, etc. from raising such a child. i think this is the definition of cognitive dissonance and self-delusion. all this experience is subjective of course, but does one not objectively get all the same benefits from raising mentally normal children without the immense pain and difficulty of intellectual disability? who actually wants to lose so much time and liberty on a person unlikely to live to an old age or to have adult accomplishments or to be a contributing member of the community? we can learn to appreciate and grow from any  unfortunate situation in life; that doesn't mean that we should value that situation as a special or desirable one. 

but i feel like all of society is in on this delusion and reinforces it. we're supposed to give extra appreciation and thanks to the parents who make this commitment. we're supposed to adore and recognize severely mentally challenged people who accomplish menial tasks like being a door greeter, when a mentally-unchallenged person given the same upbringing and resources could be being a doctor or engineer and benefiting the lives of countless others. and we must also point to the very very very rare successes of a select few people with down's or some other limitation who become actors or something and say ""look what they can accomplish when we believe in them"" when we all know that it's the unique case that it is.",6
"i (22m) was sexually assaulted by a girl at a party and my girlfriend (23f) walked in on it happening - she broke up with me after slapping me in the face and now i am devastated. ** update: thanks everyone for the kindness and support. i have made an appointment with my schools counseling center and they said that they can definitely hear me out and help me present my case to the appropriate school authorities. **

——————————————————————

hi. i am a 22m senior year in college. my girlfriend is a 23f in grad school at the same university.

we have been dating for six months and everything was going well or so i thought.

over the weekend, we both attended a party and got quite a bit drunk.

at one point i got up to go to the bathroom, and another woman followed me into the bathroom and started forcing herself on me.

i tried to make her stop but she whispered in my ear ""if you scream, i will tell them that you raped me now shut the fuck up"".

i began crying but she proceeded to do things to me which i never wanted to do with anyone, ever. and i never wanted to be forced.

after a few minutes (or eternity whichever is longer), my girlfriend went to find me and three open the the bathroom door to find me being assaulted.

her first instinct was to scream, which attracted a crowd. my rapist/assailant, backed away and like a deer in headlines, gasped and pointed to me and said ""he started it!"".

at that point my girlfriend tried to kick my testicles but thankfully i protected them but then she immediately smacked my face while i was busy protecting my crotch.

then she ran out of the party and texted me ""never fucking talk to me again ever scumbag and if you do i will get the police involved""

i tried responding back that i did not chose what happened and that i was a victim not the instigator but she doesn't believe me at all.

i went to the campus public safety office and they tried to ask me questions as if i was the person doing the sexual assaulting. i ended up leaving before i got in trouble myself. 

i'm fucking devasted and don't know where to turn. she fucking hates my guts and thinks that i tried to seduce or assault another woman when really it is the opposite of what actually happened.",7
"by teaching my son how to slay with a nerf gun.. been a while, peeps! seems to have turned into a bit of a smut/drug use sub. not that i have room to talk. for you today, i have a work-safe fu. 

&#x200b;

so here's the deal. \*context\* i play cutthroat prison rules when it comes to just about everything. my father bestowed this mindset to me and his before him. i don't take it easy unless someone really needs a win.

badminton? droppin spikes like a haunted cavern.

monopoly? stackin bills and givin chills.

nerf gun wars? better wear eye pro. that includes you zandipus(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9fgkdi/tifu_by_drilling_my_6_year_old_in_the_face_hail/).

so with xmas came the restocking of the nerf guns, darts, combat rolls and broken hearts/faces of my children. my oldest son (7) asked me, ""dad, how are you so good at nerf gun wars?""

""well buddy, in this house we play by 2 rules...."" 

**1) always aim for the face**.  

**2) don't get shot in the face.** 

&#x200b;

he thought it was hilarious and repeated it all afternoon. a few days went by until this past week when the expensive private school had a school-wide nerf gun war. their set of rules was that everyone wears a hoodie and they can only shoot at the chest/belly area.  i think it was civil war style? like in the gym for some history deal where they line up and face one another and practice shooting volleys at each other.  lame sauce. 

&#x200b;

now is probably a good time to point out that i'm a millennial war vet (if you haven't read my prior posts)  so naturally my kids are pretty well accustomed to cover & concealment, complex ambushes, hostage negotiations, etc. 

also a good time to point out that i disassemble the nerf guns and give them a little extra face-smashability by twisting the rubber bands a few times, or adding extra bands. you get a much better face-welt effect that way. 

&#x200b;

anyways, my kids tote off their arsenal of non-regulation eye busters to attend the  sissy-fest ""war"". i was not there of course, but as explained to me by principal nofunzilla, 8 or so modified nerf guns were distributed to my oldest kids friends, his brother, and himself. after the first ""volley"" my kid loses interest, and as he put it, ""got his wolfpack together to slay some nubes."" 

of *course* he had briefed them on the above mentioned rule set. they went full tactical, hid under the bleachers and other obstacles, taking cheap shots at random kids faces, eliminating teachers when deemed necessary. then their extended friends joined in so they developed a pretty substantial vigilante syndicate. 

the whole staff lost total control of the situation and **all** the kids broke character and turned it into an all out brawl, led by my son, achilles of the myrmidons.  i imagine 400+ elementary students running for their lives in the chaos while 20 or so wreak havoc like william wallace & co.(http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mcsitsxagg4/t2xasdgiv0i/aaaaaaaag3u/5_gcfehw8cc/s1600/the_patriot03.jpg)

&#x200b;

needless to say, i was grinning ear to ear with pride during the whole conversation with the principal. i have to hand it to her, she did a great job saving face for the school, using lots of cop terms like, ""we're doing everything we can to investigate the incident"", ""parents are being notified through the proper channels"", ""final warning""  .... yadda yadda. she left a final jab with, ""contraband weapons will be retained by the school board until further notice."" 

&#x200b;

 ""bummer. who won?"" 

&#x200b;

my pride diminished quite a bit when she informed me that my own son squealed on me. fair's fair, since this style of war is all he knows. he really didn't feel that he did any wrong. now moving forward the rules will be modified: 

**1) always aim for the face**.  

**2) don't get shot in the face.**

**3) never squeal.** 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - taught my kid to shoot people in the face with juiced up nerf guns, ended up almost getting him kicked out of private school. tarnished my relationship with the school board forever. no longer being invited to meetings or chaperone functions. last straw before my kids get kicked to the public school system.   

 edit.... sigh, edit. really hoped i wouldn't have to edit this one but apparently nerf gun hero's exist, and boy are they upset. i hit up google extensively looking for exact makes and models but since there's a zillion of them i couldn't find them. sorry. so, rubber dart enthusiasts alike you'll have to settle for written word. first off, yes, by adding bands i mean to the outside of the ""spring powered, loop pull cock style blasters"". we also got a set (maybe chinsey brand) of miniature ones, of which had a chooch factor far below standard. so i popped them apart and laho and befucking. hold. rubber band. giver about 40 twists and she's in business.

i plan on following the advice of u/comecloser9 by stepping up my own study/practice methods and routine. i also plan on going to counseling together because as some of you have guessed, there are some underlying communication issues.

"by never mentioning an allergy to my girlfriend. my girlfriend and i had been out late partying last night, and woke up pretty late in the day. we were pretty darn hungry and it was around lunch time, so we figured it was a perfect opportunity to head over to golden corral and pig out. after we finished stuffing our faces, we did as one does at a buffet, and smuggled out something snacky. so i filled up a bowl of those orange-slice gummy candies, brought it back to the table, wrapped some napkins around the pile, and stuffed it in a pocket for later.

as i'm driving us home i start slowly munching my way through them. i get through about 6 or 7 of them and i start to feel a bit off. i smack my lips a bit and say ""man, why does my mouth feel so dry?"". my girlfriend looks at me funny.

""you good?""

""yeah... i dont know, i feel really...off?""

i glance over and she is now looking very concerned. i suddenly realize my mistake.

""ohhhhh. fuck.""

""fuck??? what do you mean? what?""

""i'm allergic to these! i forgot.""

""you what""

now to me this wasn't *that* big of a deal. i'm allergic to some ingredient in certain gummy candies. i've never found out exactly what. jelly beans and gummy worms are ok, mike and ikes and any of those fruit slice ones are not. its not that bad of a reaction. my tongue swells a little, my mouth and throat get super dry making me incredibly thirsty, and i get a bit light headed. i would probably have to eat a lot to end up in the hospital. this isn't even the first time i've forgotten and eaten a type i'm allergic too. 

the problem is that somehow, in the 2 years we have been together, its just never come up.

my girlfriend starts freaking out, thinking i'm going to need to go to the er, worrying that i'm about to pass out while driving us, and i'm trying to explain that 'its not that bad'.

it doesn't help that i'm also giggling a bit over the silliness of forgetting i'm allergic to something. i finally get her to calm down a bit. chugging massive amounts of water when we got home probably did not help her concern but it wasn't until about an hour later that she stopped staring me down, expecting me to die any second. 

but hey at least now she knows. any time i go for any gummy candy now, she swoops in and makes sure its a type i know is safe. she also tells the story any time allergies come up in conversation.

&#x200b;

tldr; somehow in the 2 years we were together i never mention my allergy. i forget it, eat something i'm allergic to. when i mention thats what i just did, my girlfriend panics because she doesn't know its not that serious of an allergy.",4

i received my pension letter from the fire department yesterday, and i was somewhat relieved to learn that i will be receiving 60.25% of base pay, tax free (the % is based off my impairment, and i had been told it could have been as low as 45%). 

my questions. 
my pension papers clearly say that i am allowed to work, however, i have heard that if i make over a certain amount of money, it can make part or all of my disability taxable. the only thing i've found online so far concerns social security benefits, but i'm assuming my pension fund has similar rules. i'm not all that concerned about this, as of now i don't plan on filing any w2's in the near future.

however, i am considering taking a large chunk from my deferred comp (457b) plan, and paying off all my debt (mortgage, last remaining credit card, and a home equity loan). 

first of all, is this stupid? 
becoming debt free would put me in a position to continue building a savings near the same rate i was able to before i retired (and that's not counting any side income i earn). it also would be a huge stress relief, especially after all the uncertainty of the past year...and that alone seems like the biggest selling point to me.

my concern is, while there is no penalty for withdrawing the money, it says it will be ""taxed as income"", which has me worried that it would count against my disability income, like income from working a job would (if that is indeed the case), and i'd have to pay taxes on some or all of the disability income as well, which doesn't seem correct, but unfortunately i'm pretty ignorant with all of this. 

everything lately just seems like such a huge decision, i just don't want to do anything stupid.

thanks in advance for any insight or advice, and let this be a lesson for you young whippersnappers, you're never too young to start preparing and educating yourself about retirement!

"by popping a pimple and having to go to the emergency room for surgery at 2 am, alone, and on my birthday because of it.. holy that title sounds pathetic but it gets even worse

warning: this is really fuckin gross
nsfw because pictures (:

so this happened in june of this year. i was invited by some friends of mine to go to an all expense paid cruise trip around europe. amazing, right? never having been out of the country, i was ecstatic at this opportunity and immediately got my passport to go. the flight was long and arduous but when we landed in rome everything was amazing. the colosseum was great, the vatican was breath taking, and the cruise was phenomenal. we got onto the boat and started our trip around the mediterranean and i noticed i had a pimple in my arm pit. not really thinking much of it, i popped it. being pleased with my work, i put on a tank top and walked around barcelona. 

a couple days pass and with the all you can drink package, everything is blending together. i notice i had a kind of lump under my armpit where the pimple was but just thought nothing of it. we keep walking in the 104 degree heat and clock a total of 90 miles throughout the trip in 8 days, so it was a lot of walking. the lump doesn't seem to be going away and i kinda ignore it, thinking it is probably just the pimple or something being irritated. eventually, it starts to be able to be seen through the surface of the skin and begins protruding. it hurts to the touch and is rough fully the size of a golfball. thinking i'll deal with it in the states, i call my doctor and make an appointment the monday after i come back ( i land on a friday). the last day arrives and i can't put my arm down. it's the size of my fist and lowering my arm is complete agony. i can't even grab the whole thing in my fist because it's so large. 

the flight home was like i was being stabbed for 16 hours. i couldn't lower my left arm and it was excruciating. we land in san francisco and my friends have to drive us back home which is another 3 hours away. we finally get home, i get dropped off, and i immediately get in my car to drive to the emergency room. i can't move my left arm at all without being in completely agony. i finally get to the er alone because my family is out of town, and the clock strikes midnight signaling my birthday. i walk in and they take a look at it and tell me it's a massive abscess from an infected pore that has to be taken out now or i'm at risk for it popping and going into shock. i'm starting to freak out because i didn't expect any of this to be happening to me. 

they take me back and give me some morphine which i'm thinking ""fuck yeah i won't be in any more pain."" he comes in with a huge face mask and a scalpel to get to work. apparently all the pus inside of it counteracted the medication so i could still feel everything. he pokes it with the scalpel and it sprays on his face mask. i'm screaming in pain as he's cutting my armpit open and popping the pustules and different pockets of pus in there. i get chills thinking about this pain still, it's horrible. so i'm screamin' and sprayin' and nearly passing the fuck out from the pain. eventually after being dug into dude just says ""k done nurse will be here soon bye."" it's 3 am and there's just blood everywhere and i'm almost hyperventilating. 

eventually she comes in with some more morphine and antibiotics and bandages me up. she told me i'm not safe to drive because of the painkillers so i have to call an uber to go home. i walk outside with blood soaking through my shirt and holding my baggie of antibiotics, and just thinking to myself i can't possibly have a shittier birthday than this 20th. i hear from my right, ""hey is there a mcdonalds near here boy?"" i look and there's this massive 6'3+, at least 300lb man staring at me. i respond that it isn't open right now and he asks if i'm calling an uber and if he can join me. i lie and tell him there wouldn't be enough room and i ask him if he could cal an uber on his phone. i shit you not, he replies ""i would, but them fuckin black folk to it, "" (he used a worse word but i don't feel like i need to type it out). i'm just like ""oh alright, i forgot something inside."" i go inside and tell the front desk about the dude outside and they have security help escort me out when the uber comes and when we go out he's harassing someone else for a ride so i just get in and jet.

i wish the story ended here but nope. i had to go to an urgent care 2 days from the operation to get the wound checked up on and more medication prescribed to me. i go inside and the doctor puts me on the table and pulls off the gauze and asks, ""are you sure they drained this?"" i'm like ""uh yeah im pretty sure."" he tells me there's still a lot in there so i have to go through the whole thing again. i got a shit ton of shots in my armpit and they used the scalpel and popped a bunch of pustules and kept squeezing all the pus out of me. i'm screaming again because it hurts so goddamn bad. i've never gotten chills from pain before until this, it was awful. they patch me up and send me back home. this whole thing continues from june 30, (my bday) to august 15. i had to go in every 3 days to get cleaned and a lot of the time, popped again. 6 shots in my arm pit, dig in and pop with a scalpel and then squeeze the wound out. the sounds were fucking horrible oh my god. then after that they'd stuff it with wick and send me on my way. 

i finished up with everything right before i went to uni. i have a really large scar in there so i guess it's a nice conversation topic. in the end, i learned to just not fucking pop pimples anymore.

"my mother committed suicide earlier this year. my aunt wants to take me to court.. i posted the whole story in r/relationship_advice. you can see that here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dnppxb/my\_aunt\_is\_taking\_me\_to\_court\_after\_my\_mothers/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnppxb/my_aunt_is_taking_me_to_court_after_my_mothers/), but essentially, when my mother killed herself, my aunt and my grandmother blamed me for this by calling me and telling me how i ""didn't cry when she died, didn't call her enough, etc"", and now i feel they are trying to take some legal action against me. i am my mother's only child (son). i am in charge of her estate, but i am 22 years old and really have no idea how to handle any of this. she stated in her letter to me that everything she has goes to me. no will though. she was divorced and single i am proceeding with probate, although, very slowly because i was so confused and hurt by all of this for quite some time.

my aunt recently sent me an email with one sentence, saying: ""call 123-123-1234 blah blah law office. you're going to court!"" i was advised not to engage with her at all and speak with my probate lawyer first. what could she possibly be trying to do?

maybe i sound confident and calm now, but in reality, my aunt and grandmother have shocked and hurt me and my father soooo very much by their actions recently, and the thought of dealing with her makes me feel nauseous. please feel free to ask for more info if this seems too vague. thank you for any help.

edit: i'm in the usa. this occurred in florida, but i do not live in florida.

edit 2 please read: ok hold up. i'm so relieved. really sorry for the false alarm, but i just got a message from my dad. he told me my aunt left a voicemail for him and said that a lawyer is contacting her about the unpaid condo fees. i have no idea why she just didn't say that in the email. after the accusations they've made towards me, i thought for sure she was going to give me trouble and had hired a lawyer. i don't know how she didn't realize that her email sounded so threatening",2

"by buying a 9 inch black dildo. the fuck up actually occurred over the past few days, and is still happening at the moment.

this story begins with me and my ex boyfriend. when we were together, we had an inside joke where whenever it was a gift-giving occasion, he'd ask for a giant black dildo. after we broke up, we remained good friends, and as christmas is coming up, i thought i'd finally give him what he'd always asked for; the beginning of my fuck up.

i went online, ordered a big black dong, discreet packaging when it arrived, no big problems.

my grand plan was to unwrap this massive shlong, put it in a gift box with some fancy wrapping, and watch him open it. 

so i take it out of the packaging, and the box it was in had a massive picture of the dildo on the front.

i take it out of the box and put the box in a bag, in the bin outside, so no one could find it. put the dildo in my drawer so no one stumbles across it.

today as i leave for the gym, the packaging is sitting outside my side door, not in the bag, neatly placed. my mind instantly screams and i throw it back in the bin.
my parents must have found it and taken it out and now i'm mortified and haven't been home since.

i'm honestly just questioning why they'd take it out anyway aaaaaaaaa

on top of that my ex and i had a massive falling out and don't talk anymore so now i'm stuck with a matte black 9 inch vibrating dick.

i am dreading going home.

tl;dr- didn't properly dispose of packaging to a joke gift (the 9 inch cock) and now my parents may be silently judging me",4

"wife posted about considering divorce here's a update. me(30m) her(29f). so a few months ago my soon to be ex-wife posted about 20% of our story in here and some very worthless advice was given to her. i just wanted people to see the outcome of her actions.

(edit: i didn't mean for this to sound like i was passing off the blame to reddit. this post is just me venting. the only advice i'm asking for is at bottom of post. try to stop focusing on the minute things and look at the bigger picture.)

i don't have any other options because my wife refuses to try marriage counseling and/or therapy.  my wife and i struggled a little for almost 3 years to get on our feet in partly due to the fact i can't get a decent job and moved around from job to job chasing the higher pays. and partially due to the fact that my wife was going through the greencard process for over a year and couldn't work so it was whatever crap check i could bring in every week and whatever money she could make online. and then when my wife got her greencard she refused to apply for standard beginner jobs to help us out because she felt we would just get caught in the trap of working crap jobs and never progressing. so she got a temp job that helped out for a few months while i was driving uber and clearing around $500 a week after car expenses. we didn't save much money then because we were away from home 12-15 hours a day due to the 3-5 hour commute in nova/washington dc area so we spent a lot on food. we ate out a lot and enjoyed ourselves every chance we got. we had moviepass which allowed us to go to the movies like 3 times a week for only $11 a month or something at the time. we went out to dave and busters and had game nights, and would go for walks in dc and explore the museums and such.

her temp job ended and shortly after that uber did a 1 year anniversary background check and apparently had changed their policies and said i couldn't drive for them anymore because of the trouble i got into about 10 years prior. (i vandalized some vending machines when i was 18 and got felony's, so screwed for life for that one teenage mistake.) so we had to turn in the car rental we had been using for over a year. i begged natalia to just go right across the street and fill out an app at cvs or anywhere to help us financially and she still refused i probably should have pressed harder but me being me wanted her to be happy even if that meant we struggled and she's got to see that if she doesn't get a job we're going to struggle.

i started hitting the job postings and was getting pretty desperate (keep in mind that we had no car and i couldn't exactly go apply at cvs). i think i went a week or 2 without work before i got a lead on a really good job that ended up making me wait another 2 weeks to start but it was worth it. got a company car, some meals and lodging paid for and all the hours i can work building greenhouses. and my wife got to come with me and even worked a little to help us save money because she wanted to go see her parenents she hadn't got to see in over a year because of the greencard process. so we worked for about 4 months and in those 4 months i had maybe 3 weekends off. it was 6am till 6-7pm 7 days a week for 3-6 weeks at a time. we got caught up on our bills, i got some dental work that was needed and we saved $6000 cash for our vacation. we went on our month long vacation to argentina (because unhappy struggling people can do this) and when it was time to come back i suggested that my wife stay and spend a little more time with her parents since when she came back she would need to get a job so we could start saving to get a house and all the other stuff married couples are supposed to do. she was very happy about this and so i came back to the us expecting to work straight through the next 2 ish months till she came home. but when i got back i was told there was no work until febuary (2-3 months away) so i went back to florida where we moved from for the initial uber job.  after about a month my wife calls and tells me she may have a job lined up in chicago and is wondering if i think she should take it. i told her my concerns…. 1) its more expensive than anywhere we've discussed living, 2) it's a broke state, 3) its cold like 9 months out of the year etc. but i agreed because i could tell she really wanted the job…. it would be her dream career job. so she flies to chicago from argentina for the interview and then comes to florida to spend a couple weeks with me but i just end up working the whole time and barely got to see her. well she got the job. she then leaves me and goes to stay with her parents who are visiting friends in miami. i drive down to see her on a weekend and we spend the 2 days and a night together on the second day i leave. little did i know this would be the last time i would see my wife. i was supposed to help her go up to chicago and get situated in our new apartment but her parents jumped in and i got pushed to the backburner. the plan was for me to stay and save for a car and then come join her up there. now we had discussed what job avenue i was going to pursue and we had agreed on a few different solutions we believed would be a good fit for me and we had all this planned out. so the day came and i called her to tell her we had the money for the down payment on a new car and that i could finally come join her. (at this point i had maybe spent 2 months out of the last 6 months with my wife so i was missing her pretty bad) when i told her that she told me she wasn't sure that was what she wanted or whatever she said at the time. then proceeded to tell me that it was for this or that (nothing that justifies a divorce). she wants time to think about what she wants. so at this point in my head over the course of the next week while waiting for my wife to tell me she doesn't want to be with me. i'm trying to figure out what the hell i did. she continues to use lines like, its me and not you. it wouldn't be fair for me to ask you to change. i cant help how i feel. etc. etc. week later she confirms that she doesn't want to be married and she wants a divorce. so at this point i'm starting to feel a little used. lets look at how it looks.

i busted my ass for almost 3 years to make sure every need and want that i could fulfill was fulfilled.

i about worked myself to death to save $6000 in 2 months to take her to argentina to see her parents.

she lands her dream career job in a city across the country from me and when i tell her we're ready to buy a new car so i can go join her she tells me that she doesn't want me there and wants a divorce.

so at this point i find a post on reddit that had been deleted by her simply by doing a google search. (pro tip, if you put it on the internet it will always be there somewhere. you just have to find it.)

and in this post she proceeded to only give 20% of the story. she told them that while i was a good guy and treated her perfectly she just felt that because i was a felon i was going to hold her back in life and how she had just got this new career job and yadda, yadda. just enough to get people on her side to help her justify in her head that what she's doing is right.

well judging from how the article was written it feels to me that she thought she could stay and work her dream job after using me to climb there. and that's basically what some of the worthless people on reddit told her to do. look after yourself etc, etc. what kind of person tells someone's wife to just leave without trying to fix the problem? especially when you know you don't have the whole story.

so now that the whole story is out there…

no she will not keep her job, she has stipulations on the marriage based greencard to prove it wasn't a fraudulent wedding... well at this point its a pretty straightforward case. so not only will she not have her dream career job anymore but now she may have to spend any money shes able to save on a lawyer so hopefully she doesn't go to jail for greencard fraud. and then she'll have to go back to the 3rd worse economy in the world.

but i'm gonna hold her back in life?

by the way, before we even met in person she was told everything about my past so there was nothing hidden.

so since i need to ask for advice, where should i travel in the world first now that my monthly bills went from $2500+ to just $600 a month?

"i got tattoos from 15-19 and my parents still don't know. i'm 22m.

when i was 15 i wanted tattoos so bad. i absolutely loved them. i wanted sleeves and a chest tattoo blah blah blah. 

so, my parents didn't let me. i worked a parttime job and saved most of my money. i remember i saved a little over a thousand. 

my uncles friend owned a tattoo parlor and i decided to ask my uncle if i can get one and he said he'll ask his friend. his friend gave me my first tattoo. didn't have consent by an adult since i was under 18, and they only charged me half.

i did this for four years. i have my entire back, chest, shoulders, and quads/ass covered in tattoos. i think i'm done now. i don't want anymore. i don't want sleeves either anymore because i work a corporate job after college.

however, my parents still don't know. i've avoided going to the beach with them and when i do, i don't take my shirt off. they have no other excuse to see me without a shirt so i'm in the clear 99% of the time. but beach time is when it usually gets tricky.

so that's my confession. sorry mom and dad.

edit: for all of those asking, yes, i regret it. it's not smart for a 15 year old to put a tattoo of a large shark on his back. not at all.

edit 2: for those asking. my left shoulder has a huge tribal tattoo that travels from my deltoid all the way down to my side. my right shoulder has a long quote with a huge landscape that also travels down my side. the center of my back has a huge shark coming out of the water ready to bite you. all of the connect and pretty much completes my back and shoulders. my chest tattoo is angel wings because i was 16 and cringe. my thighs have various things, they're all small tattoos that all have different meanings. as i got older i cared less, and now i have a spongebob tattoo on my right thigh of him flipping a crabby patty. i wanted to complete it by getting sleeves but the idea of it just turned me off of the whole thing. so i do not plan on getting anymore tatttos ever. so yeah. it's a lot. like, a lot a lot.",11

"by listening to tenacious d around my 2yr old daughter.. yesterday afternoon, i was cleaning the house while my 2yr old was at her kiddy table coloring and i was in the living room with her, cleaning, and had my earbuds in while i was listening to my playlist (which includes all the tenacious d albums). i should mention that i have a soundbar stereo system that also has bluetooth connectivity.

if you're familiar with the works of kage and jables, you'll know of a song called, ""double team"". it was at the end of this song that my earbuds caught around the vacuum i was using and yanked them out of my phone, prompting the phone to connect to my sound system automatically. over the speakers comes the ending of the track, which is kage and jables saying, ""hail satan!"" back and forth.

after reconnecting my earbuds, i looked at my daughter, still coloring, apparently oblivious to what just happened, and continued cleaning. about 10 minutes later, i'm in the kitchen to grab my daughter a snack, when my sweet, innocent, 2yr old baby girl in the room over starts saying, ""hail satan"" while continuing to scribble happily in her frozen coloring book.

being the poor father that i am, i began to laugh like a madman at the image of a 2yr old saying those words. that was a bad idea, because now, whenever my daughter wants to get a reaction out of me, she screams, ""hail satan!"" at the top of her lungs.

my wife is still pissed at me and doesn't want to take her to daycare next week...

tl;dr i accidentally let my daughter listen to tenacious d and now she shouts ""hail satan!"" at the top of her lungs to get my attention. now my wife and i aren't sure if we can take her to daycare next week.",4

"if i take my coworker to hr for touching my car?. okay, so here's the story.

 
when my old car broke down, my grandma gave me hers. it's a 2014 honda accord, and the thing has basically just been sitting in her garage for the past 5 years. it's in mint condition, and has crazy low mileage.

 
now, my coworker, ""louis"", has always kind of given me the creeps. he's in his late 40's, but goes around hitting on all the girls in the office that are in their 20's. he just has this totally fake vibe about him, and i've just tried to stay as far away from him as i can.
 
when i rolled up in my new car, he absolutely lost him mind. he starts asking me all the specs, details, other car stuff. then he asks me if he can take it for a test drive. i tell him absolutely not. honestly, who even asks that?
 

later, i come out and he is inspecting my car, running his hands all over it. i asked him wtf he was doing, and he said he was just making sure i got a good buy. he then asks if i can let him inside so that he can see the interior. i said, and i quote ""louis, no. don't touch my car, don't look at my car, you're never going inside of it.""
 

now, if it couldn't get any worse, he brought a bag of candies to work. he was trying to give some to me. i said no. when i got out to my car, he had taken them out of the packaging and laid them out all over the hood of my freaking car. since it was hot, they got sticky (edit to clarify: didn't fully melt but got really sticky and gross) and i had to take my car to the wash. i honestly feel like i'm in the freaking twilight zone at this point.


he came in to my office this morning and started making more jokes about taking my car. i got up, without saying a word, and left my own office. now i'm wondering, for taking this up with hr?

edit/some clarifying information: this happened on work property. we have assigned spots, he is next to me. i didn't take any pictures of the candy (although i should have). i have no clue how long it actually sat on my car for, but it wasn't really melted. just partially melted/a bit sticky.",3

"by not properly checking the passport rules of travelling to kenya, throwing $30,000 dollars down the drain.. update at the bottom. tl;dr: we were able to find a way to make it!

literally just happened today. my mother, brother, sister and i were all planning to go to kenya for a giant vacation. it was the death anniversary of my grandma, and since my mom had not been there in 20 years, she decided that she wanted to go and show us where she was raised. 

we are a pretty low income family due to my mom having a brain tumour a few years ago that still exhibits problems for her and all 3 of us kids going to school, so only work is part time for myself and my brother (sister was too young). due to this, we saved up as much as we could, and even though it hurt us a lot financially, we bought the tickets 6 months ago using a travel agent for a total cost of $6000. 

since it was with a travel agent, we thought it was a done deal. he sent us the ticket and travel itinerary, and said everything was good to go. we soon learned however, that this was wrong. but that's to come later on.

anyway, due to us thinking that it was a done deal. we called up our family in kenya and told them that we would finally be coming to visit them. this had them excited, especially my uncle, who is fairly wealthy, and decided that he wanted to make this trip worthwhile. knowing that we couldn't afford anything special, he decided to pitch in to make our trip something we would never forget. a $20,000 dollar event itinerary filled with a personal driver, 4 days at a safari, 5 star hotels, scuba-diving, and more. it was one if those dream vacations that you could not wait for. it would have been great.

fast forward to today. where we had finished buying luggages and packing them, had arranged accommodation for our dog, and had put valuables in secure areas. it was a 3 week trip that was supposed to end on january 6, 2018. remember this date folks.

we take an hour ride through traffic, and finally arrive at the airport at 3:30, with the flight leaving around 6. we have everything ready and with us, and we were feeling really good. we go up to the lufthansa baggage check in and wait. around 4, it's finally our turn. we go with the right amount of suitcases, show them our ticket, and then finally give in our passports to be scanned. everything looks good... and then here's where it started to crumble.

remember how i said that the return date was january 6th. well lufthansa just then tells us that they can't let us on the trip because to go to kenya our passport should be valid for 6 months after the end of the trip. our passports however, expired on the 4th of june. 2 fucking days difference. this comes as a blow to my mom, and after going through confusion, she starts going through panic. she asks them what we can do. and they say that there's an emergency passport place that can do it in an hour.... but they close at 4:30 and it was already around 4:15 by then and it was half an hour drive. not possible.

my mom goes back to the lufthansa desk and asks them if there is anything else they can please do to help, is there a way to reschedule from the desk so we can go in within the next 2 days to try and get the renewed passport. they say they can't do anything. she asks for what to do with the travel agent, they say that she better leave or else they will call the police on her.

we leave the desk and we go to sit down and call the agent. we ask him to call the head of service and to try and change the flight date, they tell him that the only thing we can do is to cancel the flight and rebook.... and of course, they'll still keep about $2000 from the $6000. we try to get him to see if they can exchange (because we knew the price for a new one would be unaffordable), but he didn't do shit and just did the cancellation. never going to hire him again ever.

my mom starts to break down. but i try my best to make her feel a better. ""how could i be so stupid, why didn't i do it"" and ""why didn't he warn us. i shouldn't have ever picked him to book our flight"" really started to break my heart. but i told her to keep her head strong, we will get through it. we immediately get home and go to get passport photos done, grab renewal forms, and get referrals and what not and have the paperwork ready to go early morning tomorrow (technically today at the time of typing) at 8 am to hopefully be ready the end of tomorrow with the urgent renewal running about $1000 in total. if the ticket is affordable enough now, we would be able to do it, it would just mean that we would have to be living pretty broke for the next few months.

 all we need now, is to see the ticket prices. we go online and my mom starts to cry. we check all the websites, the lowest price is $12,000. double that of what we paid. and way out of our price range due to all the things we had paid for before hand (even worse, the ""refund"" from lufthansa would take approximately 4 weeks to arrive. we won't be able to afford it, unless we go afterwards. but doing that would mean that the amazing event that my uncle set up would go down the drain. we had to go to our last resort. 

my mom had to call my uncle, and ask for help. we tell him that they wouldn't let us on the flight... and he starts fucking raging. he is so pissed and it's understandable. he would lose his $20,000 that he spent  just for us since it was all booked and paid for already. after though, my mom starts to pretty much beg him to help us find a flight, but he says that he can't spend over $12,000 more for us, especially with that $12,000 being on the line with us actually getting a renewed passport tomorrow. we beg him to please do it, and he angrily says he will see and will call by 1 if he has a flight (we need a travel itinerary to show the passport office in order for them to renew it in 1 day).

it's almost 2 now, and there's no call. i'm sitting in bed here depressed while typing this (which is probably why there where mistakes in the text. i'm to sad to think properly). meanwhile my mom is crying while trying to fall asleep. my mom's biggest dream in years and about $30,000 all pretty much down the drain. and only because our passport was expiring in june 4, 2018 instead of june 6, 2018 on a trip that was ending on january 6, 2018.

tl;dr: we had a giant trip planned to have my mom finally go back home to kenya, had a shitty travel agent who didn't  tell us that our passport was 2 days under the 6 months validity after the trip, and now my mom is crying and our uncle who payed the $20,000 event itinerary hates us.

*edit: holy shit. i didn't expect the post to get this much attention. anyway, i realized that there where some errors so i'm here to fix them. for the discussion about whether it was start or end trip, i honestly can tell you i had no clue. all i do know is that they said two days off and 6 months. so i interpreted it as in they we're counting january in the 6 months since that would make the most sense then. im sorry  if i caused any confusion

also, for those saying that the 6 month thing is everywhere, it is not. they even told us at the gate that if we were only going to frankfurt (the stop over location), it would be 3 months and we would be fine. the 6 months was a thing set by the kenyan government.

i'm going to be looking into the comments a bit more to answer more questions in future edits, while also trying to decide what stuff to do in order to try and see if this trip is still salvageable for my mother.

edit #2: i see a lot of people want me to post proof cause they think i'm lying. it's 4am right now, but ass soon as i get some sleep and it's around 7 i'll post the original ticket that was wasted. 

edit #3: here is the proof as wanted
 removed.

edit #4: due to a large amount of people messaging me to warn me, i have decided to remove the proof since it was too risky to have up. sorry folks

edit #5: i've been asked multiple times for an update, and i've been so busy that i couldn't take the time to tell you until now. anyway.... i made it. thank you all sooo much! your invaluable advice made it very easy for me to get a set path of what to do. first off, i fought with the travel agent in order to get my money back. i used some of the advice from this subreddit and you were right, i got back the $6000. then, i went online and found the cheapest flight i could that left in two days, having found one for $12000 (the cheapest). ""booked it"" and printed  the travel itinerary and went early in the morning to get the emergency passports. we got them on the same day due to showing the itinerary (thank you reddit) and we're ready on that front. 

that was the easy part though, for now, i needed another $6000 in order to pay for the new ticket prices. knowing how badly my mom wanted it, i spent two days where i had to sell my dream computer, nintendo switch, xbox, ps4, ipad, and pretty much everything else i had that was an ""entertainment product"". my mom's happiness was worth way more than the happiness i got from those items so i thought it was a valuable trade. it's now been the end of the second day (12:00 am as i write this), and the smile on my mom's face seeing as she drives through the town, meets old classmates, and so far has gone swimming in the fishes has been one i had not seen since my dad left us, so i thank every single one of you who showed your support, and also have me advice on what to do. these next 3 weeks are all because of you. 

as an added bit: for all those that offered to give donate and stuff. i thank you so much for caring about my family and our happiness and willing to give us some of your money. however, while i appreciate and will take your support, i could not take your money. i'm not that type of person to have the internet pay for my problems to be fixed. they were my problems, and i had to find a way to fix it. still though, the fact that you cared so much really touched my heart and gave me more motivation to get the trip back on course. thank you all.

"my sister's boyfriend24 of 7 years sexually assaulted me18. hi, i am really new to reddit but i needed somewhere to vent because i literally can't turn to anyone. 

my sister has been dating this guy for a long time and everyone (including myself at one point) thought they were perfect for each other. he is super caring of her and i can definitely tell he loves her and she loves him. i am also dating a guy and it's been a year and a half and i love him to bits and he loves me the same too. 

i am close to him but he always felt like an older brother to me. he is funny, smart and everyone loves talking to him. my family, my boyfriend all love him as well, we all have a close relationship with him. my sister and him live together in an apartment but a few months ago she started visiting our house again and they would stay over and she would go to uni or work and come back later that day.

him and i would just chill on the lounge watching movies or talk or play games. we have done it many times before in the past and it was enjoyable and fun because my parents are usually never home and i get lonely sometimes (my boyfriend can't come over often since he lives quite far). 

one day we were on the couch, (we usually keep our distance, we sit on opposite sides) and he was sitting right next to me. i kept to the corner of the couch and we were just having banter and telling jokes like we usually would. but everytime i made a joke, he would tickle me and touch me in a very different way which i could tell. at first i tried not to think much of it and told myself i was overthinking. but then he had his hand on my thigh and i just froze. i didn't know what to think because i never thought i would be ever stuck in this situation. he kept rubbing his hand up and down my thighs and i felt sick to my stomach but i didn't know what to say. all of a sudden my sister called to tell us she was coming home and he immediately stopped and i got up to go the bathroom. i was frozen for a good 5 minutes and i had to process everything that just had happened. another few instances was i could obviously tell he was checking out my body. i am relatively short and small but my chest somehow is relatively large for my body size and i try to hide it most times because it makes me feel uncomfortable as i know many random guys in public make comments about it or obviously check me out. i rarely ever wear low cut tops because of this yet my sister's boyfriend has quite obviously checked them out if we are ever close to each other. 

anyway, this happened again, however this time my sister was here too. she had a day off and we all chilled on the couch. he sat in the middle while my sister and i were on each side. i somehow fell asleep during the movie and as i woke, i could feel he was touching my butt under the blanket. more like caressing. my sister was there and he was still doing this. i pretended to be asleep because i had no idea what was going on or what i should've done. this went on for about 10 minutes before my boyfriend called and i pretended to wake up.

then the dreaded day happened. we were chilling again as per usual. i made sure to keep my distance and try my best to keep normal because i wasn't sure of what was happening. i have major anxiety so my mind was always racing. he somehow edged so close to me and was touching my thighs. i felt so so so so so uncomfortable but nothing would come out of voice because i was so so afraid. he ended up caressing my entire body and pushed open my legs as i tried my best to focus on the movie. he kept trying to get me to look at him and kiss him but i kept my face towards the tv. he also ended up touching me down there and almost fingering before my sister ended up calling. i kept my face normal (i have major depression as well, so faking is really easy for me) and waited until the left to go home. i broke down crying and crying and crying because i couldn't believe what just happened. i had never felt so unbelievably disgusted and dirty and ashamed. i hated it so much that i didn't even say anything. but i literally had no idea what to say. i feel so extremely guilty because i love love love love my boyfriend. but if i tell family, i feel like this would ruin everything and i feel like my whole family will just break. especially my sister and my boyfriend. it's hurts me the most that i can't tell my boyfriend but it literally eats me alive. we are going so perfectly well but i feel as if i'm slowly detoriating and i don't know what to do anymore. i'm so so so lost but i absolutely can't say anything to anyone.

i messaged him a few days later telling him how disgusted i was with him and that i honestly never wanted to have anything to do with him again, but that i would have to for the sake of my family and my sister(my sister also has issues and i think she would literally break if she found out) he apologized and said how sorry he was and ever since then, if we ever see each other we avoid each other,  but not enough that people notice. 

please please please give me advice on how to get over this and become stronger because i literally am so lost and hurt and sad. i've been crying for a good few months now. i even considered breaking up with my boyfriend because he doesn't deserve such a broken girl like me. i wish i told someone but also am too afraid for the aftermath and how it would affect everyone. so please tell me how to get over this... it kills me everyday. i love my boyfriend so much, i wish this never happened. please help.",7
"given time to decompress slowly, could a human survive in a martian summer with just a oxygen mask?. i was reading this comment threat about the upcoming martian announcement. this comment(https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3mjrdt/nasa_to_confirm_active_briny_water_flows_on_mars/cvfq50q) got me wondering.

if you were in a decompression chamber and gradually decompressed (to avoid the bends), could you walk out onto the martian surface with just an oxygen tank, provided that the surface was experiencing those balmy summer temperatures mentioned in the comment?

i read the martian recently, and i was thinking this possibility could have changed the whole book.

"for blowing up on a girl i invited to a date when she brought a male friend?. so about a month ago i met a girl in a coffee shop. we talked for a bit, exchanged numbers, and have gotten coffee a couple of times since then and have texted and what not.

my company was offering tickets to game 6 of the caps/hurricanes series in nhl hockey for extremely good value. i have recently gone through a breakup of my girlfriend of five years and i'm really starting to like this girl so i decided to invite her to the game on a date. i tried to make this pretty apparent - it was meant to be a date. she agreed and said hockey is actually one of her favorite sports. at his point i'm super excited.

well i get to her place to pick her up for the game, and she comes out with a male ""friend"". she hops in the backseat with him and i am completely blown away. not sure how to question her, i simply say ""i thought we were the only ones going, i only have two tickets.""

her: ""oh i didn't even think about it. this is my friend \*whatever\*, he wants to go too so i thought i would invite him.""

me: ""that was nice of you, but i still only have two tickets. i can only take two people.""

her: ""you can't find another ticket? i may have to stay home if that's the case.""

at this point i was confused and frankly outraged. she had to have known the tickets were rare and not cheap - even if i got them at a great value. i kind of lost my cool and told them both to get the fuck out of my car - just with a few more words than that.

i sped off and went to the game by myself. it was a fantastic experience, but unfortunately that encounter is literally all i could think about. i still can't believe it happened.

this morning i texted her to lose my number and blocked her. if her intent was to just bring a friend, maybe i was too harsh. that being said, i really wonder if they were actually just friends. maybe she thought we were just friends and it wasn't actually supposed to be a date? just sucks because i really thought she was interested in me - i sure was in her. too good to be true i guess.


info: since some of you asked for additional info regarding how i asked her and what i said specifically.

i started by asking her if she was busy on monday (the night of the game). she said she had nothing planned. i then asked if she was interested in going to the game. my exact words were: ""i can get us tickets at work if you are interested.""

she replied with ""omg yes!"" and thats when she told me she loved hockey. i also suggested dinner but then realized we wouldn't have time before the game so she said we could just get food at the game. sounds like a date to me.

as far as what i said in the car, once she said she would rather stay home than not go with her ""friend"", i said ""alright then. that's kind of shitty of you. guess you're not going, get the fuck out of my car.""

she laughed and they both got out and i went on my way. nothing really more than that.

just a massive kick to the nuts when i spent money on expensive tickets and was very excited to go with this girl just to have her basically make me go alone. it came out of nowhere and at no point in our prior get togethers did she hint that she wasn't interested in me. i mean we had the whole night planned out pretty clearly.

edit: for what it's worth, i'm thinking maybe she just lost interest in me and thought this would be an easy cop out. tip to anyone: if you aren't interested in someone, tell them. had she texted me days before the game and said ""im not going to be able to go, im just not interested. have fun."" i would've said ""well that sucks, but i'm glad she was honest."" i would've found a friend to go with.

but to cop out like she did was brutal and just downright shitty.",3

"for having sex with my fiance?. so i live on a second floor of an apartment complex with my fiance , my neighbor below us when we moved in, we offered our cell numbers to them several times, in case we were ever too loud so they could hit us up to ask us to be quieter, they declined each time. now the rules with the apartment are ' quiet hours ' are between 9 pm- 7am. after a week the neighbor tells us we walk too loud and we need to stop at 8 pm because that's when he goes to bed for the night. so we did our best to adjust for him, then yesterday about 5pm my fiance and i were going at it, and our neighbor below us bangs on his ceiling/our floor mid fuck, which killed my so's mood, so we stopped. then about 5 mins later the dude bangs on our door and yells at us that he doesn't wanna hear us fucking and threatens to call the cops or apartment management if he ever hears us again.  
  
so, am i the asshole here for getting down, or is he the asshole for losing his shit and demanding us change our lives for him?  
  
  
edit: holy crap, i didn't expect this to blow up. i took some of your advice and reported the situation to property management, they said they will speak to him about it. also starting soon we will be petty and fuck every single day, not extra loud but normal sex, starting at 8pm and go until 859 pm. thanks guys.",3

"i was so obsessed with saving money and frugal living and it made me depressed.. i have been working on an emergency fund and retirement to a lesser extent. but i went a little overboard. i prohibited myself from seeing friends to save petrol and money and i wouldn't allow myself to buy meat when i felt like cooking something fancy. i've missed out on bands in town. i don't travel to see my mother because the train fare means spending. now i'm sitting here feeling sad and lifeless. i'm just posting this in case someone here is going down the same path. being sensible is one thing, denying yourself completely is another and a false economy. i would give up a bit of my money not to feel so depressed now. anyway i'm going to go treat myself to something today so hopefully my mood will improve.",10
"by misunderstanding a job proposal and quitting my current job as a permanent employee. so, this actually happened two days ago, and it's still developing. i am working at a company where i feel completely miserable, and that pays barely enough to pay rent and survive, and been here for three long years. anxiety attacks, depression, and the complete lack of hope into having a life where i don't have to struggle and skip meals to be able to pay my bills started to accumulate and boosted me to start sending cv's everywhere. the thing was that no one was calling even after months and months of applications. the paranoia starts and i slowly start to convince myself that my portfolio sucks, that i'm horrible at what i do, that i'll be stuck in this job forever, etc. etc. a few months go by, and a friend of a friend knew what i did, and asked if i was interested in an interview at her company because they had a job position opening up. i say yes of course, send my cv and portfolio, they answer back saying they loved my work and want to meet me personally for an interview. the interview itself went perfectly. i never felt so comfortable talking to someone in english (not my native language, and neither the native language of the guy that interviews me), and in the end, the guy basically says, and i quote word by word, ""for me, it's a yes, now it's up to you if you want to accept this position"". of course i said yes, the job seems amazing, the pay is more than double of what i am currently making, it was way closer to home, everything is perfect. before saying goodbye i asked him to send me by email the formal proposal just to be sure, he says, sure, i'll send it to you today or tomorrow, and i go back to work. the next day, and heres the fuck up, i give the notice to my boss before receiving the proposal in fear of not be able to start when need, telling that i got an awesome job proposal, but that i need to start in less than a week and half. everything is being arranged where i work as i write this, i've handed my resignation letter, talked to the company owner and everything. what i did not consider, is that i had to give at least 60 days of notice since i am a permanent employee, and while i'm writing this, the hr department is to call me and tell how they will settle this up, in other words, how much money am i going to have to pay or ""not make"". the rest of the day of the interview goes by, and nothing on the proposal. the next day i email them, sending all my informations, and asking for the proposal, and they say that the dude that interviewed me is going to contact me. so today he messages me: ""hey man, \*\*\*\*\*\* told me that you are available at the combined date, but remember, we are still to make a decision, did you tell your office that you are leaving?"" and i say that yes, of course, i legally had to, especially to start the day that you mentioned. and he just responds with an ""oh.""

i don't know if i misunderstood something he said, or if he forgot to say something to me, but he always seemed assertive that i was going to be hired, since they weren't really interviewing anyone. also, take in consideration that the interview was really informal. i asked if they when where they going to make the decision, and he said today, so i guess i'll update in a few hours if i'm unemployed and potently homeless, or if i got my dream job.

tldr: got ahead of my self, quit before getting an official job proposal; might be unemployed and homeless if everything goes bad.

"why i quit smoking... i started smoking when i was about 12-13. i am just shy of turning 32 and 6 months ago i quit smoking from 25 cigarettes a day to zero, no patches, no aids. i just stopped and never told anybody why..

13 years ago when my daughter was born i promised myself i would quit smoking. 2 years ago when my son was born, i also promised myself i would quit smoking. my parents would nag me to quit, my government raised the price of a pack to nearly $20 almost a full hours pay per day was going on smoking and i didn't mind.

then one day i am out the front of work and a regular customer comes up and starts harping on about how she has stopped smoking. she did patches and now had stopped smoking. i was always happy when somebody made it out. smoking is fucked, i had physically known that for years but i was hooked.

then as i went inside i got angry with myself. here is this lady i had always considered low class, borderline white trash. she had done it, made it. she was free of the addiction and here i am, better then her, still addicted.

the next morning i woke up, brushed my teeth and didn't go for a smoke. i just stopped, patches are for the weak i told myself and i was better then her.

so i hereby confess that i was not strong enough to quit out of love for my children, my life, my money or my future. but i was strong enough to quit out of jealousy and out of the desire to be 'better' then somebody else.

"i came home to find one of my landlord's employees had let himself into my apartment (pennsylvania). i had been out of town for about 2.5 weeks. i just got back to my apartment building and found a man in my apartment. he told me that he was an employee of my landlord, who owns a carpentry business, and was doing some work on a wall in the building -- not in my apartment. he had unlocked my door with a key given to him by the landlord and was using the apartment for water and the bathroom.

this feels like a blatant breach of contract. what can i do? i have actually been hoping to end my lease in may instead of august. is there any way i can use this as leverage?

update: i called my landlord to 1) see if the man was really an employee (he is) and 2) let him know that i'm taking this very seriously.

he told me that the man had entered my apartment to **check the smoke detector**. the man said nothing of the sort and, according to my lease, **checking them is the responsibility of the tenant**. also **from my lease**: 
""landlord will give tenants 24 hours notice of date, time, and reason for the visit. in cases of emergency, landlord may enter property without notice.""

"i (32f) walked in my dad's (56m) room and found him asleep at his computer, exposed, with my (6f) daughter asleep in his bed a couple feet away and porn videos playing on his computer screen. need advice on what to do about it.. i didn't think i'd be posting on here, but my world has kind of turned upside down and could use some feedback on what to do with this situation.

i (32f) live with my (35m) husband, my (6f) daughter, my (3m) son, and my (56m) father, who is my kids grandad. i was going through a lot at the time i got pregnant, and i wasn't even sure my husband was going to stick around. my parents had just divorced, so my dad ended up moving in with me after they sold their condo. he is kind of a man-child and i don't think he would have been okay on his own, and i desperately needed help raising my daughter as i was already barely hanging on to a crappy job and my now husband was undecided if he wanted to be part of her life yet. obviously being pre-defensive here but these are my reasons.

my dad has been a great help and he spends almost all of his free time with my kids. my husband and i both work, so it really has been invaluable. my daughter is 6 now and she and her grandpa, my dad, hang out a lot. he still lives with us, mostly out of me feeling too guilty too kick him out. she loves her grandad a lot, and every once in awhile, maybe once a week, she'll have a sleepover kind of slumber party with grandpa. it's kind of a fun treat thing that he does if she gets good marks or helps around the house. she looks forward to it, and i've never questioned it. they stay up late and eat popcorn and candy and watch movies and she sleeps in his bed with him.

so this i dont know what to do with or what to do next. i've talked to the few family members that i know won't blab to the whoke workd, and i've heard differing opinions.

last weekend, i woke up earlier than normal on sat morning and went to my dads room to check on them. his room is kind of an addition to our house that the original owners put there, like almost a guest house but just a room that's attached. you have to go through the backyard to get there. i cracked open the door and peeked in the room

might be a trigger

and my dad was passed out at his desk chair with porn videos playing on his computer screen and his pants around his ankles. my daughter was asleep in his bed or else i would have gone competly crazy. i just froze like no way this is what my eyes are seeing right now. i grabbed my daughter and got her out of the room while she was still too groggy to notice what was going on, and went back in his room and ripped his f-ing head off. he swears up and down that hed never done this before that she didn't see anything. he said he fell asleep watching porn and didn't mean to be exposed like that.

i'm not naive enough to think my dad never watches porn but he was doing it right in front of my daughter. a friend of mine says that this is beyond messed up and that my dad might be grooming my daughter or even other things that go with that. i'm still in shock that he would do that anywhere near her. to think that it might be worse than that makes me nauseous. i don't want to overreact and i dont want to tramautize my kid anymore than she probably already is. i don't want her to even know that this happened.

i haven't told my husband yet, and i' e stayed home from work all week. i'm not letting my dad be alone with her at all, and he's just been hiding out in his room. i just keep telling my daughter that he's sick. my husband has an off week and gets home tomorrow, and i didn't want to tell him over the phone plus i know he'll lose it on my dad straight away. 

i'm posting here because i don't know what to do next. i'm terrified of overreacting and terrified of underreacting and i made the mistake of calling my aunt and telling her about it. she thinks i'm overreacting and that i need to just make sure they don't sleep together anymore. i know my husband will want to kick him out on the street or worse. i just don't want to make this any worse on my daughter than it already is. if you were in my position, what would you do about my dad? would you kick him out or just limit his contact with my daughter?

tl;dr: went to check on my daughter who was sleeping in my dad's bed (her granddad) and found him asleep and exposed at his computer desk with porn on the screen and my daughter asleep in his bed a couple feet away. need advice on what to do about it.",7

"i (20f) checked my bf's (29m) phone and may have ruined our relationship. he was on his computer playing a game and his notifications were going off like crazy.  it was like 3am. there's this one girl from his work that texts him sometimes and she's really pretty, i saw it was from her and got a bad feeling so i checked his phone. it was stupid but he works late with her sometimes and said she told him she was interested in him once, when i see her i always wonder why he's still with me. 
  
so i started reading and it was all pretty innocent but he seemed really close to her and i got kinda sad and got sucked into it guess. when i looked up again he was turned around looking at me in his chair.  
  
i'd asked him early on if we could exchange phone passwords and he said no because he valued his privacy, so i definitely broke his trust and i know that was stupid and wrong. 
  
he asked if i found what i was looking for. i couldn't really say anything, i just kinda sat there looking at him and waiting for him to yell at me. (he's never yelled at me, but my family does and it just felt like he should.) he asked me if there was anything else i wanted to look at while i had his phone and i shook my head no. then he came over and kissed me on the forehead, and said he'd take me home.  
  
i cried the entire way back and he didn't say a word. he walked me to my door and patted my head and left. i've texted him a few times today but he hasn't answered. 
  
i couldn't go to work today, i've just been in ther corner if my room curled up watching youtube videos and crying. he won't talk to me at all, i don't know how mad he is or what he's thinking and feel sick. we were talking about getting married. how do i get him to communicate with me again so i can apologize? should i go go his place?",7

"when a product breaks or malfunctions, even if it's out of warranty or it's your fault, don't just throw it away. contact the company and let them know that you love the product and ask if there are any options to replace it. frequently, they will either offer a discount or a free replacement.. edit: people keep asking for examples, here are a few that come to mind, but there are many, many more. i may add more as i think of them. here are a few companies that have taken care of me outside of warranty for items over $100, and only one i asked for it for free (chevy out-of-warranty repair). 

* nordstrom: jeans that split in the seams after about a year they replaced no questions asked.

* apple: replaced two iphones over the course of 3-4 years outside of apple care that were malfunctioning after i broke the screen. never asked for free phone. went in for screen fix, they just replaced entire phone free.

* apple: 2015 macbook pro having random issues. they thought it was the battery / fan assembly and charged me $220 to replace, but said it could be the logic board. if logic board, i would pay the difference ($550 minus $220). they even gave me a written quote. found out after another month it was the logic board, but when i brought back in, they offered to replace the logic board free for the inconvenience of bringing in a second time, and i never even suggested getting a discount on it or acted inconvenienced. just being friendly with the staff.

* kühl clothing: had a $250 puffy winter jacket, picked up a hot soup pan and melted it clean through. composed a very funny email and picture documenting and sent to them and asked if i could pay to have it repaired since i'm such a klutz and melted it. instead, they immediately sent me a brand new jacket. i didn't even pay for shipping.

* chevy: new-ish car at 40k miles or so. needed expensive out-of-warranty repair after my car had already spent 3 weeks in the shop a few months earlier. i did ask for this one, because it was so close to the warranty period still and i wasn't terribly happy with the reliability record of the car. they obliged.

* rode microphones: shockmount for a professional microphone broke. i called customer service to order a new one (3-4 year old product), and saw they were $50 on the website. just told him it broke and i wanted to order a replacement part, instead they just offered to send a replacement free of charge. didn't even pay shipping.

* verizon wireless: broke screen on iphone x, called customer service to see if i had the device protection (thought i did). didn't ask for anything free, just asked her if there were any options available, the rep said she'd gladly split the cost of the repair with me and promptly credited my account for $137.50 right on the same phone call.

* blinds company (?): found receipt, limited warranty, i admitted having to pull them down hard to get them to close, possibly being responsible for the damage. i paid shipping to send them in, they repaired for free.",8

"by tasting a horse girl's gross vagina in a meeting with my boss (nsfw obviously). so this happened a few years ago, and it always gives my friend's a chuckle so i figured i would share! also...really not proud of this moment

so a few years ago, i was working happily at a country club. at the time i got along really well with my coworkers, and boss, and loved working there as a result. now at the time of this incident, i was single, hated country music and was somewhat naive when it came to girls/relationships as well as alcohol having turned 21 a few months before.

&#x200b;

my sister -who is older than me by a few years- invited me to go out with her for her birthday at her favorite bar. the bar was having a ""coyote ugly"" night, and not knowing what that was, i assumed it had something to do with hunting or something as my sister is a bit of a ""country girl."" now as i said, i don't particularly like country music, but decided to go and celebrate with her figuring i would have a couple drinks and then head out.

&#x200b;

well i get there, walk inside and see chicks standing on the bar dancing to darius rucker wagon wheel (fuckin banger btw) and pouring free alcohol into peoples mouths every 15-20 min. i may not like country music but i do like free booze so i stay and celebrate. one of my best friends shows up to party it up as well, and we had a blast. fast forward a couple hours: i'm wrigity wrecked off jack fire shots and tequila, and start talking to one of my sister's friends who wants to dance. so as we are dancing, but she finds out that i am 21 and curves me saying she wants to date a doctor or something? so being drunk i just kinda saunter back to the free booze.

&#x200b;

all of a sudden i find myself talking to this girl i hadn't seen before. i'm clearly wasted, and she is a little drunk, but still talking to me and asks to dance. she was an enigma of a woman. she wasn't particularly pretty or ugly, wasn't short but also wasn't tall. wasn't fat, but also wasn't in shape. she just kinda looked like a wii avatar or a sim poured into a pair of daisy dukes a size or two too small. just bland. flavorless. now first of all, her name was chevy. that was her name. i don't know what it was short for, but you can see where this is going. she said she rode horses, and loved her own horse and could shoot like the boys and what not, but i'm kindof in and out of the conversation trying to dance.  and so we dance. i just wanted to groove. throughout the night my sister keeps coming over and separating us. basically being a cockblock to me and i don't understand why and keep brushing it off.

&#x200b;

anyways, we go outside and make out against her old 1500 crew cab in the parking lot and i proceed to finger her (like i said, not proud of this) and was on the fast track to going further when my best friend calls me over from the door of the bar. he is there with my sister, who is pissed at me and this girl. my sister claims this girl literally sleeps around with everyone at this country bar and that there wasn't exactly the most hygienic and that i really didn't want to do what she thought i wanted to do.

&#x200b;

fast forward to the next day, i show up to work for a meeting with my boss and fellow managers going over some facility work we had to do. i had a little bit of time before the meeting and had told my coworkers about my strange night and then we got things underway. about 25 minutes into the meeting i start getting antsy and start biting my nails as i do when i'm bored and oh my sweet jesus... i had showered quickly in the morning and didn't think anything of it, but the vaginal discharge had gotten under my fingernails the night before and it was like putting my tongue on a rancid dying animal. i'm talking like a stinky sour tang. like eating a crock pot beef stroganoff sour patch kid. it was absolutely horrid.

&#x200b;

immediately i heave. i didn't puke thankfully, but it triggered a gag reflex i hadn't experienced before nor since. the room of 7 or so people all stop and look at me, and i go to the bathroom where i rinse my mouth out before returning to the meeting. everyone figured i was just feeling sick from the night before. now up to this point i didn't know what the taste was. i thought maybe i encountered something in the kitchen or outside that led to this. it was only after becoming more acquainted with females that i realized the gravity of what happened. to this day i will never even think about buying a chevy. ever.

&#x200b;

tl/dr: got drunk and fingered a ""down home country girl"" at my sister's birthday. tasted her nasty vaginal discharge when i bit my fingernails in a meeting at work the next day. will never buy a chevrolet ever.

&#x200b;

edit: wow! this really blew up overnight. i just wanted to thank you all for taking the time to read and share in my gross experience! also thank you so much for the platinum, was not expected from this story of all haha. just real quick i want to clear up a couple things i have been seeing in the comments. 

\-first, a couple people are saying i'm the nasty one for not washing my hands. you're correct. i showered the morning of the meeting, but did not scrub under my fingernails as many people forget to do. out of the many fuckups in this story, the main fuck up is me not washing my hands better, yes, but this title was pertinent to the story and made me crack a smile so i went with this. 

&#x200b;

\-second, this post was never in any way, shape, or form intended to be misogynistic in any way. to the couple of people saying i'm slut-shaming, remember i was full steam ahead on hooking up until my friend intervened on my drunk bum.  i have no ill will towards anyone, especially her, so any negativity you find here is what you bring in yourself.

&#x200b;

# -third, guys. im not above stank dick. i get it after a heated confrontation with a hotel concierge or an intense powerwalk during a bath and body works bogo sale. 

it happens to literally every person on the planet. its ok to be stinky sometimes. personally i am petrified of getting stank dick before someone is trying to 'head downunder' and i'd say most people probably agree.

"i'm (25m) intimidated by a (32f) woman i met. so friday night a friend invited me to a party at a very nice house. when i got there i met a woman and we hit it off really well, she was laughing at all my shitty jokes which just fuels my confidence. we were also very close and touchy throughout the night, and when the party ended we exchanged numbers. on the uber ride home my friend was explaining to me that i was basically getting close with the owner of the really nice house, he's telling me how's she's some high level investment banker and how she's worth millions of dollars. as soon as i heard this i felt deflated, career wise this girl is leagues ahead of me. she's well educated and independent. i work as a service tech for hvac with no college education making pennies compared to her. i texted her this morning and she immediately says how much fun she had friday night and how she wants to hangout again. i'm scared to respond, because now i feel like i have to act like i even deserve to be in her presence. what should i do to make these feelings go away?

edit: hey everyone! i'd like to thank you for all the awesome responses and words of advice and encouragement, spent over an hour reading all the comments. me and her texted and set up a date! the first date is wednesday night,

"boyfriend (26m) hit me and i (26f) am worried he's dead. this is all so fucking crazy, i wish i could just rewind and start over.

i've been dating my boyfriend since we were 20 and he was always very charming, handsome, and respectful. basically the perfect guy. my parents loved him and i love him so so much, my heart physically hurts when i think about what he's doing to himself.

he started doing coke more as a social thing - we moved to a new city because he found a better job and his new work friends did it. the first time he did it, i freaked out and was all like what the fuck are you doing, because i do not like drugs one bit. he thought it was fine because it was ""classy"" since it's expensive and businessmen and celebrities do it. i'm not shitting you, he literally said that to me. i thought he was fucking insane but i obviously couldn't stop him. i tried to deal with it and think, okay it's just for fun and it's not affecting his job or anything and we seem fine.

he kept doing it and it drove me insane. a fun treat turned into a habit and when i tried telling him he needed to get help, he'd tell me he had it under control and that he didn't need to do it, he just liked it and didn't wanna deprive himself of feeling good. btw, he acted like a complete asshole when he was high. talking a lot of shit and acting like he was super cool. it was nauseating and embarrassing to see him acting like that - the charming guy i loved was gone and replaced with this disgusting, narcissistic character.

i even told him once that i wanted to do it with him because he liked it so much and i wanted to see the hype. i thought he was going to say no to protect me from it. nope, he got extremely excited and helped me do it. it was okay, i guess, but not anything i would be willing to prioritize over my life. he saw it as a bonding moment and felt more open to talk to me about it, how he wanted to do it together again and how the sex was so much better.

we have been through so much because of this. he's been in rehab twice but left and he's a grown man, i can't force him to do anything. our parents don't know. his parents were sending him some money when we first moved to help us get started in a new place. they don't send money anymore but he still doesn't want them to know. he doesn't want me to tell my parents because he doesn't think it's their business or a big deal. i feel so incredibly embarrassed as well. i've always been a good kid, never the one my parents had to worry about and my mom would probably have a heart attack if she found out about this.

he came back from rehab and he kept using. then one night he just disappeared. i tried calling his bitch ass friends and his job and no one knew where he was. i found out he was fired weeks before for fighting someone and destroying shit. he called me in the morning and was just being a condescending asshole, making fun of me for being worried about him and laughing. it was the weirdest shit. i didn't see him for days and it was horrible. he wouldn't tell me where he was.

then he came back home one night randomly and came into our bed. i was so fucking mad but i was worried about where he was so i let him stay. i was crying and made him promise he would stop or else i was leaving for good. i even got up and packed up a few bags to scare him and it worked, he promised he would never use again if i didn't make him go to rehab. so i agreed that i would take care of him. i took off of work, fed and bathed him like he was a baby. i think he had started using something else too because he just seemed so messed up. he was depressed and angry at me, it was horrible to watch.

eventually, he got over it and it felt like we were the closest we'd ever been and we loved each other so much. we talked about everything, things i'd never told him before, and it felt like we were on cloud nine. he was determined to stay clean and i believed him. we were okay for a bit, probably one month.

my parents were coming to visit and i was really excited about not having to hide anything - we were good and we didn't have to lie about all that stuff anymore. we could just forget about it. well, he disappeared again the day before they came and he stole $1,200 from me. i can't even describe how it felt waking up and the house being empty. i couldn't even tell myself he went to the store or something. i knew he was gone. typing this out, my hands are shaking. i hated him so much for doing that to me. my parents came and i had to lie and say he had a last-minute work conference event or whatever shit, i don't know. they knew something was wrong but didn't say anything. i hated lying to my parents but how was i supposed to tell them - oh yeah, you know that amazing guy you've known for years? he's addicted to coke or crack or some shit and he stole my money and lied to me and i've been lying this whole time and he has no job and he's a fucking lying bitch ass.

when they went home, i went into a depression. i was just thinking about how he came home and we were together and things were so so so good and how everything was actually bullshit. he was so skinny and felt self-conscious about it and didn't want me to see him since i became bigger than him but i didn't give a shit about that, i just wanted him healthy again. when he was going through withdrawal and was sick, i would give him baths every night since he couldn't do it himself. even when he got better, he didn't want to have sex and i understood. and then one night he asked if i'd take a bath with him. i asked if he was having a bad day and not feeling good but, he gave me this cute smile and just shook his head. i was so excited that i had him back. he really fucking tricked me. shit.

he ended up coming home a few days later. he was high as shit and didn't even care. he was just smiling and ignoring me, giving me this look as if he was so much better than me like looking at me and smiling or furrowing his eyebrows and shaking his head and laughing while i yelled at him, as if i were crazy or something. i told him i fucking hated him and he ruined my life but he didn't care. and then i said i was going to tell our parents and that got his attention. he started cursing at me, calling me a bitch and slut and whore, things that didn't even make sense. i told him off for stealing my money and he took it out of his bag, saying he actually still had half and threw it in my face. i tried telling him to get out but he said he wasn't going anywhere since it was actually his house. we bought the house together. yeah, he put more money into it but he hadn't been fucking working for months and i was paying for everything. then i did something really stupid. i don't know why i did it. i took my phone and said i was gonna call his parents and tell them that their son was a fucking loser crackhead. i was just trying to scare him - i would never call them like that, in the middle of a fight in front of him. anyway, he was yelling at me to stop and he pushed me on the wall and we struggled for a bit. he tried grabbing my phone but i had quick reflexes and i'm pretty petite so i was able to just pull away from him. then he grabbed my hand and put his arm on my chest to hold me down and was calling me a bitch and screaming at me. i was yelling back and tried pushing him off me and pushed on his chest and his shoulder and then he slapped me really hard on my cheek. like, swinging his arm, left a ringing in my ear, bruising kind of hard. he had never hit me before - he used to never like play fighting because he was scared he'd accidentally hurt me.

he let me go and i just sat on the floor and cried. he got really fidgety and i could tell he felt bad about it but he still did it. he told me ""c'mon get up, it wasn't that bad"". i told him i hated him. then he had a panic attack or something, he started breathing really hard. he just mumbled he was sorry, grabbed some money from the floor and left.

two weeks later, he called me and was crying and said he was sorry for everything and wanted to come home. i said i never wanted to see him again. he begged and promised me that he would go to rehab but i told him i was over his lies and he promised that he'd get clean for real this time but i kept saying no and that he needed to call his parents.

then he asked me if i'd come see him in the hospital if he od'd and i told him no. he cried harder and said he didn't want to die and he was gonna be good for me. i knew he was lying and probably ran out of money or something. i hate myself and think about this every day but i just hope him i hoped he died and hung up. that was a few days ago and i haven't heard from him and i am so scared that he's dead somewhere or passed out on the street and in need of help. i can't believe i said that to him and feel so horrible - that's not the kind of person i am, i would never wish death upon someone, especially him. i don't want him to die. i was just trying to hurt him.

this is so long and i'm sorry but i can't tell anyone about this and it's killing me. i think about everything that happened between us, all the little details that he probably never noticed or remembers. i feel depressed and on edge all the time. my mind is always thinking about him, hoping he's okay. i feel like i wasted my life on him and don't know what to do. i've been dealing with this nightmare for so long and i still miss him so much, my heart physically hurts. what did i do to deserve this?

edit: wow. i just want to say thank you to everyone who replied. i certainly did not expect to wake up to 200+ comments and everyone who offered me any inch of support and advice and even criticism (because i know i made mistakes, i should have taken action right at the beginning and not let this escalate and accept his fucked up behavior. i'm an enabler, i know) thank you for listening and i cried a lot reading your comments, that you guys have all been through the same exact thing and he's not gonna change and even if he does, it'll take years and he'll never be the same person and i can't trust him. it's a hard truth to swallow but you guys are right.

it feels like a small weight has been lifted off of my shoulders and those telling me that i'm strong - thank you but it doesn't really feel like it. ",7
"for dismantling the bed and taking it elsewhere rather than sleep on the couch?. update:
https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/birzcc/update_aita_for_dismantling_the_bed_and_taking_it/

this happened over the past few hours. so my wife and i started bickering because i forgot to buy her favorite kind of ice cream both times i went grocery shopping this month. i told her i'd go out and get some but she started yelling at me. she works a really stressful job so i just figured it was that.

she didn't want me to go and make a trip to the store just for the ice cream where our local food store is about an hour and a half away (living in a rural place sucks). i insisted, she said no, i said i wouldn't worry about it then. she got mad and said she would go get it and that i could sleep on the couch. i told her ""i'll be godamned, i bought the bed and if you have a problem, you can sleep on the couch"". she countered with the fact that her name is on the lease so it's her roof and i wouldn't be sleeping on the bed under her roof.

by this point it's escalated pretty bad just because of a childish quarrel. but i decided to take it a bit further. while she was gone, i took apart the entire bed and drove it to my friends house.

i'm currently laying in it and i'm about to turn my phone off to avoid the oncoming storm.

during sexy times tonight, she told me that she had a deep and dark secret that she wanted to tell me, so i asked her what she was talking about and she told me - she has an incest fetish. she told me that she wants me to roleplay with her and pretend that she's my sister while we're having sex. i was really weirded out by this and it kind of ruined the mood for me.

i was feeling particularly weirded out with this because i have a sister who isn't much younger than her that shares very similar facial features with my gf, so what i'm trying to say is, they look kind of alike. they joke all the time that they could be related, which admittedly doesn't help me feel better about this situation.

what makes things even worse is that my sister and girlfriend are pretty good friends, so they share makeup and hair ideas with each other. my girlfriend wears pretty much the same style of makeup that my sister wears and recently she also dyed her hair the same color as my little sister, so that make them look even more similar. i feel like if i were to go through with this, i'd feel like i'm having sex with my actual little sister.

is this fetish super weird? am i overreacting for feeling weirded out by this? do you think i can become comfortable with it? how should i talk to her about this?",7

"by having a scary dream, resulting in the police being called for a missing person (me). this is probably my sisters favourite memory from us growing up. this all happened when i was about 4 or 5 years old. i had had a scary dream and was having trouble sleeping, so i went to my parents room and crawled into my mums bed without her noticing, and fell asleep.

when my mum woke up, she flicked her blanket off, covering me, and went downstairs to the kitchen. after a while of me not surfacing, she went looking for me in my room and couldn't find me. panicked, she starts searching every room in the house, and turning up empty each time. no sign of me in the garden, and no sign of me out the front. the whole family have now started running around checking every possible spot a tiny person could get into, getting progressively more and more worried by the second.

my mum's room was pretty bare, and i guess the heaped blanket on top of me showed no infant outline, and so they kept missing my comatose body.

after a few hours, the police were round, filling in a missing person's report and taking all possible identifying details. i wish i could remember everyone's reactions when sleepy u/roodeemental walks downstairs into a room full of super stressed out and concerned people, but my sister tells me it was one of the best things she ever got to witness. my mother was a flood of every emotion, and the police were glad i was fine. i was confused, but not nearly as much as everyone else. that day my family learnt how bad they are at hide and seek, and what i am able to sleep through.

the credit card is southwest airlines rapid rewards. credit limit is around $30,000. my dad received a confirmation email from the utilities company but never a call or any confirmation from the cc company. he said he clicked to pay the full amount of 41.84, then when submitting he got an error and checked his email and saw the confirmation show up. when he went back to the page he saw that it was complete so didn't think any more about it.

i think it's possible he hit 41084 instead of 41.84 by accident, but the charge should never have gone through. it was above his credit limit, he pays roughly the same amount every month, it was for a single home utilities...

my dad had to call the cc and utilities company back and forth like 5 times before the cc company finally sent him a dispute form (i mistakenly thought that it was the utilities company earlier). however, this form is a general ""credit not processed"" form with no really relevant questions to what's going on. this was sent back in a few days ago and still waiting to see what will come of it. others have mentioned regz, i don't think my dad brought it up so i don't know if that would have made a difference in how they handled it.

anyway here's the conf email and dispute form, i couldn't help but laugh when seeing how ridiculous the number is.  http://imgur.com/i4je790",10

"by stripping naked at -40f in alaska. obligatory ""this was a couple weeks ago,"" but it's actually -30f outside right now too. i'll try to make this short and leave details for questions in the comments.

fairbanks ak has a tradition where you strip down to your underwear (or bathing suit, whatever) when it gets -40f (-40c) or colder, and take a picture by the uaf temperature sign.(http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0a8l4gexmpk/tyxxn5zxl9i/aaaaaaaaf6m/uss9rrreife/s1600/kids+at+fairbanks+.jpg)

so, it hit -40f recently, and i wanted a photo. my roommate was supposed to go with me, but bailed out last minute. so i went by myself.

i arrived at the location, stripped down to my boxers in my car, and yelled out the window to a random dude outside who was taking pictures for people (he was in full arctic winter gear). he agreed to take mine, i threw him my phone and ran out of my car to the sign.

took the picture, and ran faster than lightspeed back to my car. get to my car door... door locked, keys in the ignition. it's -40c out and i'm almost naked. i frantically ran around until someone let me in their car to warm up. due to the cold, my phone died. i have no ones numbers memorized. i was in serious trouble. 

well, i go to the u. the building i associate with most was right up the hill from the sign. i had a spare key for my car in an office. however, it is inaccessible by direct road, so having someone drive me there was not an option. it was either someone drops me off at the closest point, or i run there in the cold (almost same distance). i didn't know these people and felt incredibly awkward, so i ran for it. 

2 minutes of blistering cold wind surrounding my uninsulated body. it was the worst feeling you could ever possibly feel temperature-wise.

i get to the outside door, and i couldn't stop shaking. i could barely open the door at all. all my skin was numb. there was a breezeway heater (which pump out a lot of heat), so i laid down next to it for a long time. i was laying in the hallway, almost naked, at 11pm, probably hypothermic and uncontrollably shaking due to my dumb decision.

when i came to 20 minutes later, i stumbled into the office, opened up google contacts on a computer, and called my roommate on the phone. he laughs his ass off, calls me an idiot, and comes to pick me up. brings me some clothes to wear on the walk back. saved my life.

so yeah. don't run outside when its below 0f, nevermind -40f.

**tl;dr: wanted to take a picture at a temperature sign at -40c. phone died, locked my keys in my car, ran to the closest building 2 minutes away with only underwear on. dealt with possible hypothermia, and a good story to boot.**

"it is not racist or sexist to want historical accuracy in historically set videogames.. lately, especially on reddit i see many people think its racist and sexist to stand up for historical accuracy in movies and videogames. this seems to be driven a lot by the sub gamingcirclejerk where every second post now is ""dae all gamers hate women and minorities""? that whole argument is built upon a ridiculous strawman. are there some racist idiots out there in the crowd that wants historical accuracy? yes. there are. but they are a small minority. it isnt in any way or form in itself racist or sexist to want historical accurate representation in videogames, if its a historically set game. i *love* when historical games and movies go that extra inch to try to portray real history because it helps the immersion so much. it is true that most historically set games arent 100% accurate anyway, but why should they continue to be washed out with *even more* inaccurate portrayal and even further towards fantasy, if their initial goal was a historic setting? most other artforms and genres already have fantasy elements so why cant we have some genres try to at least strive for accuracy, even though it may never be 100% accurate? why make it even more intentionally historically inaccurate because ""its not 100% accurate anyway""?

example: if a game takes place in a time in history where only whites where around at that location and setting, i want only whites. if a game takes place in history where only blacks where around at that location, i want only blacks. if i play a yakuza game i want only japanese people and no white or black people in the game. if i play a fictional war game set in the congo jungle i want only blacks unless whites where there at that time. if i am in a prison in a game i want only male inmates assuming its not a womens prison. i want the games to look like reality did. if you think that is racist or sexist against the particular group being excluded sorry but you are the nut.",6

"i killed two people, and i felt nothing.. it was years ago, but it haunts me to this very day.  this wasn't a premeditated murder or revenge or a drug deal gone wrong. it was just me being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and i acted purely on instinct to protect myself.

i was a junior in high school and had just gotten out of class on friday when my older brother called me. he was taking his best friend, chris, kayaking that weekend and he wanted to know if i could go. i drove home as fast as i could and met him to load up our kayaks. we left home around 4:30 in the afternoon. 

after driving for five hours on the interstate, we exited and drove to a gas station to fill up. my brother stayed with the car while chris and i walked into the gas station. i noticed two guys in their mid-twenties arguing with the cashier when we walked in, but i ignored their yelling because the whole situation made me feel uneasy. i worked my way to the back of the store where the restrooms were.  

the yelling got even louder, so i turned around to see one of the men with a blue north face jacket holding a pistol up in the air. he yelled ""enough!"" and brought the gun down and shot the cashier in the head. he started shooting into the store and breaking the glass doors to the refrigerated drinks. i freaked out and hid behind the closest display and started to hyperventilate. a manager came busting out of the back office right by me and he had a pistol, too. he tried to shoot the assailant, but he wasn't quick enough. the man in the north face jacket shot the manager in the chest, and he collapsed about ten feet from me. 

he was bleeding everywhere. the blood was just pouring out of him from his chest and he was struggling to breathe. i crawled over to him since i had learned first aid as a boy scout. i applied pressure with my hands, but i knew it wouldn't make a difference. he was bleeding from his back too and the floor was slippery from all the blood and it was all over my knees from trying to help him. i realized he wouldn't live without immediate medical attention. the man in the jacket started shooting again. he shot the lights over the hotdog display that i had last seen chris standing by. and then everything slowed down and become incredibly vivid and clear. i wiped my bloody hands on my shirt, reached over the manager's body, grabbed the pistol, pulled the slide and stood up. i had fired a gun before. my dad taught me when i was younger. i aimed at the second man and shot him in the leg. the recoil of the shot caught me off guard because it was much more powerful than i expected. the man in the jacket turned around and looked me in the eye. he seemed shocked that i had just shot his accomplice. he kinda shook his head like he had no clue what had just happened and then he started to raise his own pistol. i shot him twice in the chest and he fell backwards and dropped his gun. his accomplice was screaming in pain and started to crawl towards the gun on the floor. i started yelling at him to stop moving but he didn't listen. as soon as he reached the gun, i shot him in the back twice, and he didn't move anymore.
i remember the police coming and asking me to sit down on the curb outside while the paramedics got the manager. i remember the clarity and the vividness while i was holding the gun slowly fading as i told the police what happened. the paramedics asked me if i was hurt because i was completely covered in blood. i remember my brother sitting by me and putting his arm around me while they asked me millions of questions and different police officers told me i had done the right thing. i remember going to some type of insurance case thing for the manager where i told a bunch of lawyers and police officers what had happened. i remember a man coming up to me and saying i had saved the manager's life by doing what i had done. i still see that man's shocked face as he turned around and saw me holding the gun. i remember the look of confusion he had as he fell down with two gunshot wounds in his chest. i remember everything about that night. out of all the things i remember, i don't remember ever being asked how i felt having just killed two people. the only thing worse than nobody asking is the fact that i felt nothing. absolutely nothing. and that is what horrifies me. i killed two people that i had never met, and i felt absolutely nothing while i was doing it.

"for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?. a bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. he regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.

now to us, i'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. we both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. there is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)

her family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, i respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.

so now to us, i proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. both families like each other and we all get along great. however.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... uhh what? we had our first major fight right there because we need her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.

i'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? i also found out she would have zero student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a ""real school"". she went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.

now i'm not going to argue her dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. that's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.

however i cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. i get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but i'm not wealthy enough to do that. we talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because i do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. then once our kid gets into pre-k she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.

now apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because i popped the question. not cool and her mom is fully behind her decision, the dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if i back out because i shouldn't be expected to do that unless i'm in a financial position to do so.

if i give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? i also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, i just don't see that being healthy either.",3

"for wanting to forgive one brother for having an affair with another brother's fiance?. let me just start off and say i think cheating is deplorable.

i have two brothers, john (28) and matt (25).

around three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that matt was having an affair with john's fiance. a fiance who was 6 months pregnant. matt turned out to be the father.

john was understandably humiliated and angry. i was fully on his side.  i was disgusted with matt and the fiance.

here's my issue though. at john's insistence, matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. he isn't allowed at any gatherings where john is. and john purposely makes sure he is at every one. 

matt married john's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.

to this day, matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. only by john but in our family's presence. he hates them with a passion even today.

my parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow john's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. even contact with matt is done in secret.

matt has been kicked out of our family business because john can't be in the same room as him. all photos of matt have been hidden in the family home. no gifts have been given to matt's child at all.

am i absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? 

matt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. he clearly regrets hurting our brother.

i can understand that john is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.

but i still love both my brothers. matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?

my poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. they have confided in me that they are willing to forgive matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. we were such a tight knit family before.

but i'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with john will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. i also worry about his mental health.

there also the innocent child in this. he deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.

i have recently been visiting matt and his family. they are clearly struggling with the isolation. his wife broke down and apologized as i held my nephew for the first time. my heart tore in two.

"for ""ruining 3 relationships"". i am a married woman who was happily married up until a few days ago.  recently my husband started talking about a new girl at work.  i thought, fine, i trust him, and he has other female friends.  

soon i noticed the way he talked about her was different.  he seemed really giddy, almost like when we were dating.  it bothered me a bit, partly because she is 19 and i am 36, but once again, i trusted him, so i left it alone.  

occasionally when he was texting her i would ask what they were talking about, and he gave me vague answers.  

one day i came home and found him talking on the phone with her.  this bothered me.  when he got off the phone i told him how much it bothered me.  i asked to see the messages between the two of them.   he said that they were private.  

he mentioned that the two of them had played a game where they guessed secrets about each other, and he gave his word not to show it to anyone.  i told him i felt this was too intimate of a conversation for ""friends"" to be having.  

he mentioned that she really didn't want her boyfriend to know they were talking.  red flags went off in my mind.  i told him he needed to stop talking to her.  he refused, saying he didn't want to lose his friend.  

eventually i decided to let the boyfriend know that they were talking and sharing secrets.   i figured i would want to know if i were him.  he said she had cheated on him multiple times before, and when he asked her about it she denied everything.

original post here: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/al10mq/my_36f_boyfriend_41m_of_45_years_ran_into_his/


it seemed like there was a mixed response on whether or not i should try to message her or not. i thought i try to get in touch with her anyway, thinking she'd either ignore it, block me or respond. she and i talked for several hours on facebook, and gave me the rundown of the worst years of their relationship. (i was at my mom's house when this happened). i asked her about their relationship, if it was really as bad as she made it seem, how did it end and a few other questions. she told me that their relationship was great the first 3 or so years they were together, that he was the best boyfriend she had ever had at that point. he was used overly flattering ways to compliment her, showered her with gifts, brought her to nice restaurants, drove her around wherever she wanted b/c she didn't have a car at the time. but, once they moved in together things started to go downhill. she was living in an apartment by herself for awhile, and he asked to move in because he was being evicted from his apartment. she agreed at the time. he tried to explain that he had paid his landlord in cash, but the landlord denied ever getting money from him. she gave him the benefit of the doubt with that excuse, but remembered it being a big red flag she ignored. 


as time went by for the last 2 years they were together, things got progressively worse. he began drinking more, he denied using drugs but she was confident he was doing cocaine as he displayed almost all the signs of a coke user. (staying out all night with his friends, not coming home until 7-8am in the morning, seemed erratic and would talk really quickly and what he said didn't make any sense). the more he drank and used drugs the more aggressive he became. at first he would pick arguments with her, he'd get angry, maybe even call her some hurtful names or say mean things about her. he would sober up and do everything he could to apologize and seek forgiveness. he started to use his alcoholism as a crutch and would use the excuse ""it doesn't count when i'm drunk"" with her. she said she was young and stupid enough to believe that excuse, and stayed with him and wanted to help him sober up. he even agreed that he had a problem and would let her help him. but, he would keep getting drunk every night and would make her feel ugly, stupid, worthless whenever he drank too much.  


she said she remember feeling like the life was draining out of her as she tried to help him. she knew she was in a bad place and didn't have it in her to ask for help, stand up to him or leave. she was ashamed of the situation she got herself in to and just stayed. 


kate said it got to the point where he would get absolutely wasted every single day. he would start drinking in the morning and continued through the night. she said she remembered finding a cache of empty bottles behind a free standing cabinet in her apartment. she said that finding that stash was bizarre, she didn't understand why he didn't just throw them away. but was also surprised that the way this piece of furniture was placed that you couldn't easily see the bottles, and the shape of the furniture created a space to perfectly hide those bottles. she didn't touch it once she found it, but monitored it and saw that it grew in height quickly. and the quality of the alcohol went down, like the bottom of the stash had top shelf liquor, and the upper bottles became shit like everclear. she never saw him buy these bottles or have them out in the open. he would lie about being drunk even though he was clearly out of it. she remember she kept a few airplane bottles of liquors for herself to make a cocktail, but a lot of them were things that needed mixers- like kahlua, godiva chocolate, baileys other milky-chocolatey drinks or fruity alcohol no one would choose to just drink by itself. but, she remember opening up her little stash of those tiny bottles and every single one was empty.  


their fights progressed when he was getting even more wasted. he would become extremely violent. she said he would take any nearby object - plate, cup, beer bottle, wine bottle, one of her things, etc and just slam it as hard as he could against the floor, wall or brick fireplace. sometimes he would throw these objects at her and she would have to find something to shield herself with. she remembers shielding from shards of glass flying at her a lot. these outbursts were extremely frequent, she said she tried to clean up the glass on the carpet with her vacuum but it never seemed like enough. so she started to always wear shoes in the apartment after stepping on a shard of a glass a few times. in addition to throwing things, he punched a hole in one of the kitchen cabinets, almost ripped a door off of one of its hinges and purposefully broke things that were part of the apartment. he would also back her up against a wall or a corner punching himself in the face or chest while screaming at her. she doesn't remember what he was saying she just remembers crying and telling him to stop whenever this happened. 


she said she remembered getting to a point towards the end of their relationship where she didn't want to have sex with him anymore. she said she was successful most of the time when trying to refuse him. but, sometimes if she refused he would get angry and either scream or throw something. she'd have sex with him after that because she didn't want the violence to escalate. she also said she tried to pretend she was asleep, pretend that she was sick, pretend she had to get up early and other excuses - and he would just go for it anyway. she said that she tried simply saying ""no"" and he ignored her on multiple occasions or would get angry until she gave in. she remembered being too scared to say to no to him and just lied there with her eye closed and he got angry because she wasn't in to it. she also said she doesn't have a number of how many times that happened, but it happened a lot. 


she also told me about the night she realized he was likely kind of crazy in a very bad. that she was scared of him, but didn't think he was crazy but just a violent asshole, but the following event made her feel like she was in a different kind of danger.  at one point she got brave enough to tell him that she didn't love him anymore, that she wanted him out of her apartment asap and that she never wanted to see him again. he got angry and was screaming that if that is what she wants then she'll never have to see him again. he slept on the couch that night and told her while she was at work he would pack up his things and be gone from her life. when she came home from work that night, she walked into him playing a video game with a mutual friend. he had cleaned the apartment, bought her favorite beer and was acting super cheery like nothing had ever happened. after the mutual friend left she asked him what was going on they had the fight and he was suppose to leave, and he said something along the lines of ""what? that never happened.""


he would frequently make her feel crazy and question her reality. he would lie to her constantly and always about things she couldn't prove were true or not. that he often lied about how he needed to spend money on his car, or he needed to buy new clothes for his job, or that he owed someone money for something. he would make her think that she was always the one in the wrong whenever they argued. she said he always found a way to turn the argument around on her. he would do things like always leave the apartment unlocked and tell her she was the one who forgot to lock the doors. he would also hide things from her and claim he never moved them. 


she was only able to escape that situation by lying about the day that the lease ended. she had told him that the lease was ending in month, when in reality it was a couple of months. she told him she was moving out to a different city to go back to school and he needed to make arrangements. since he never paid any money for anything, he had no idea that was a lie. once he left she stopped answering any phone calls or emails from him. she was concerned that he ended up moving to the same city she moved to. they met in her college town, she moved back to her hometown. he also moved to her hometown (where we live now, but it's a much bigger city than the college town fwiw). 


i asked her about stalking concerns, and she said that the first year they were apart he would try to call her from different phone numbers for awhile. she's still afraid of answering the phone from numbers she doesn't recognize. she also said she's confident that he would drive down the same street her parents lived on (where she was living for awhile after she left him). she said she doesn't think he has tried to find her in recent years, but it remains a fear of hers. she said said that this was the first time he approached her, but she remembers she saw him at the mall once and ran away immediately and went home. she also saw his mom once in public, but left before his mom saw her. 


she said the things that she had told me up to this point in the convo were things that happened frequently, they weren't one-off events, they were things that happened several times a week. by the end of their relationship she was extremely depressed, she had suicidal thoughts, she thought she was worthless, she had to get therapy for depression, ptsd and anxiety. she told me that even though it's been 10 years she will still have a nightmare about him. she even told me that she remembered waking up to her own screams a few times after their relationship ended. 

she continued to tell me there were a handle of violent or crazy one-off events that stick out in her mind - 

* he once got so angry and violent, he pushed her down on the bed.

* he once pushed her so she fell backwards onto a couch. 

* he once put his hand around her throat and closed in just tight enough to scare but to not make any marks or cut off her breathing. 


* there were two times where she needed help paying the bills, she usually didn't ask him because he would complain about her only being concerned with money. but both of these instances were the same - she asked for money, he took out cash from his wallet and threw it in her face, and told her he was going to buy her something nice but isn't going to anymore. 


* when they were visiting two of her friends (who she knew didn't like him), he made it a point to deeply embarrass her - told her friends that she had slept all day, was lazy and he's okay with it and is okay taking care of her and cleaning up after her mess. 


* he visited her at work and asked for $10 cash. she told him that she needed that money to buy lunch, he said he would bring her lunch, he took the money and never came back. 


* he almost got her fired from her job - she had a job where they got products early and had a specific release date. their manager would allow them to take home the product to learn about, but only if they prepaid for it. this was against store policy, but everyone kept their mouth shut. he went to a different location and blabbed to the employees there about what they did at her store, one of those employees happened to be a district manager visiting that store. she didn't get fired, but he ruined a fun perk for everyone. 


* when he would go through phases of unemployment she would try to get him to do some basic chores while she was gone. things like load/unload dishwasher or take out the trash. she remembered that she asked him to take out the garbage, which he agreed to do. she put the garbage by the front door, it sat that for awhile. it sat there long enough to where a few more garbages bags piled up. he kept saying he would take out the garbage. she remember getting annoyed because it started to smell really bad and the bags were leaking. so she gathered them up and threw them away herself. when she got back inside he was angry and told her he was about to take out the garbage that minute. 


* she asked him to clean the kitchen once, when she got home from work he was in the kitchen cleaning but very sarcastically and in a mean tone said ""are you happy now?"" 


she also told me that after she went through therapy she realized that he very likely had npd or at the very least a lot of narcassist tendencies. she remembered the following characteristics he displayed frequently: he thought very highly of himself, he thought that he was more intelligent, more attractive and simply ""better"" than others. he felt like he didn't need to have a real job ever, that he would just get the things he wanted one way or another. he ended up with free rent, free food, never having to cook or clean while he was with her. she said he trouble keeping jobs because he would always go in late, and even got caught stealing from one place. he would frequently talk about how people in his life were lesser than him, and how he was using and manipulating the people he worked for. he would also get angry if he was every in a position where he had to clean up after himself or perform a chore at home. he spoke and dressed in a manner that gave him the illusion that he was superior. he made it a point to speak by using ""big words"" instead of speaking plainly. he always wore higher end clothes - button up shirts, nice slacks, nice shoes, even though he didn't have the kind of job to support those buying habits.


after we spoke, i started to connect the dots of other things he does. and things he has done in the past that i never thought too much about. a lot of her comparisons of npd was eerie, as he still displays a lot of those traits but not to the extreme as she described.  


she also told me to get a background check on him, she said the last she knew he was found guilty of the following: assault on a female, 2 duis, hit and run property damages, several drug (pot related) charges, and a theft charge. i never thought to ever do a background check on anyone i know, i guess i'm stupid to just trust people. but, i confirmed everything she has said, but it looks like he's been clean for the past 6 years.. whatever that means. everything i found i was able to google his name + arrest records. the last thing he was arrested for was fall of 2012, of what i could actually find online alone. 


i kept trying to get him to talk about what happened last weekend, but he kept refusing to talk about it. he eventually got really angry with me, more angry than i've ever seen him be before. his face got really red and it almost looked like was trying to hold himself back from reacting. i was honestly a little scared. i haven't told him i talked to her. she also informed me that she would be blocking me after our conversation ended because she didn't want any ties directly relating to him. 


i told my mom my boyfriend and i were having troubles and asked to stay with her for awhile. she said i'm welcome, as well as my son, to stay for as long as i want. 


so, i've packed a bunch of stuff for me and my son while he was at work and told him that we were going to stay at my mom's for a bit until he either wanted to talk or go see a therapist. however, i'm not sure i even want to continue the relationship anymore. i'm seeing him in a different light now and i don't like what i see. i guess it's time to find a lawyer and tell them about my situation. 


tl;dr: reached out to kate, his ex, on social media we talked for hours online while she described everything about their relationship which was horrifying. she told me to look into getting a background check for him - he has assault charges, duis, drug and other charges i could find. he got extremely angry and a little scary the last time i tried to get him to talk. my son and i are now at my mom's. now i need to think about next steps.

"for mocking a friend who fakes their accent?. i (18m) have a really close friend (18f) who has recently started faking a british accent, it's so clear to everyone that it's fake. honestly it makes it hard for me to do anything w/ her because people notice right away. parties? fake accent. class? fake accent. talking with friends? fake accent, everyone can tell it's fake, and they always question when she started faking her accent or question if it's actually real.

the final straw was when i invited her over for dinner w/ my parents and she tried using it on them. they instantly noticed and looked at her and then me. it was so embarrassing and the rest of the dinner was them asking when she started using a fake accent, and her pretending to be oblivious ""*whut are yew tawlking abowt?*"".

i have been trying to ignore her, but my parents and her parents are really close, and they've helped us financially when we have been unstable, so they told me to suck it up.

i was hanging out with her one day, and she was doing her fake accent. i started talking to her back in an australian accent, and every time she asked me what i was doing i said ""mate, i dont know what your talking about mate...dingo dango mate.""

put in my formal request online for may 13th-may 31 on march 18th. it was approved by the owner. 
nothing was said after that about my trip. 
i left and came back and noticed i hadn't been paid at all while i was gone. 
i went back into my clock in app on my phone and found out he went back and denied it may 14th (day after i left) without saying a word.  after i got back to work nothing was said to me until i brought the issue up. 
who would i talk to about this is there anything i can do? it put me in a huge financial pickle for a bit.

**edit*** 
i didn't expect these many responses. 

this was an odd situation relocating. they pretty much sought me out because of my experience. i knew i was getting a pay cut so i wanted some more incentive to move.  my other company was giving me pto for 3 weeks. they knew this. so i asked for 3 weeks paid time off in order for me to move up here. verbally they agreed on it. i myself thought it was weird but hey. they wanted me up here. 
i talked to hr today who is the owner's wife. we pulled up my contract and there it was. 

""three weeks paid time off per year(one weeks to use from 6m to 1yr anniversary""

so on paper i messed up. i should've been more clear and had them write that in the contract. 
i know we verbally we agreed on it i made it clear.  there was no other reason why i would accept the position otherwise. the owner and his wife denied saying anything of the sort. 

i'm just upset that they let the approval go for over a month then go back and deny it the day after i left.

"another update should i be concerned about my daughter's (18 f) relationship with her married teacher (40s m)?. original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8pf202/should_i_be_concerned_about_my_daughters_18_f/?st=ji7p2tpd&sh=7875ec0b

previous update:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8poj55/update_should_i_be_concerned_about_my_daughters/?st=ji7p1s9t&sh=ed83f0a1

as of yesterday i felt like i was handling this situation the best way i possibly could. as of today i feel like a failure of a mother.

i got up really early this morning around 3 am to give my daughter's father a call. he's over in europe at the moment so i figured that time would be best for him, but i mostly just wanted to get ahold of him before my daughter woke up so that she wouldn't overhear any of the conversation and think that i was going behind her back. i decided to do a quick check before i called him and peaked into her bedroom to make sure she was still asleep. maybe i'm naïve for being shocked and completely caught off guard by this, but not only did i discover that my daughter wasn't asleep, she was gone. i have never known her to be the type to sneak out (though i guess it's called ""sneaking out"" for a reason) and even when she's gone out late with friends in the past she's always let me know beforehand.

of course i freaked out and tried desperately to get ahold of her. i sent her dozens of messages and tried calling her but it kept going straight to voicemail. after about 10 minutes i gave up on reaching her and was trying to figure out who to call that might know where she was when i heard the front door being unlocked. i went and stood out in the hallway and when she walked in and saw me she had a look of pure panic on her face. i never have been very strict with my daughter in the past, but in that moment i very sternly told her ""i need an explanation. now.""

she instantly burst into tears. i asked her where she had been and i asked if she was with mr. smith but all she kept telling me was ""i'm sorry, i'm sorry."" i finally just told her ""i have been nothing but loving and understanding with you. i know you're an adult now, but you still live under my roof. the least you owe me is the god damn truth."" i asked her once again where she had been and she said, still crying, ""out for a drive."" i asked if she was alone and she shook her head no. i asked if she was with her teacher and she hesitantly shook her head yes.

it took me a moment to sit and process that all of the things i was afraid of happening had likely been going on behind my back this whole time, and that my daughter had clearly lied straight to my face when i spoke with her yesterday. eventually i said to her ""so i take it you weren't being honest with me when you told me you saw him as just a friend.""

to that remark she went from softly crying to sobbing. all she had to say was that she was sorry but she ""loves"" him.

i can't remember the last time i felt this angered or betrayed or disgusted. and not because of my daughter. because of her teacher. this man has clearly been grooming and manipulating my daughter and i was stupid enough to not do something about it sooner and gave my daughter and her teacher the benefit of the doubt even with all of the obvious warning signs. now it's probably too late for me to do anything.

we talked for a while and i tried my best to as calmly as possible explain my concerns about their relationship to her. i tried to tell her that it wasn't healthy and that being in a relationship with someone who once had a position of power over her is a recipe for disaster. i told her that it's easy for a man of his age and with his experience to take advantage of a younger girl. i also explained that a man who sneaks around with her when he has a wife and a family of his own is a man who does not truly respect her or care about her well being. to everything i said though she just responded with something along the lines of ""he's not like that, it's different with us.""

i was able to get her to talk a lot more about what's really been going on between them, but i don't feel it necessary or appropriate to share all of those details here. if you feel i've left out any significant details you are more than welcome to ask me to clarify something, but otherwise i'd prefer not to disclose more than what i have to as it is obviously an uncomfortable and sensitive topic. i do feel i should mention that she claimed the ""romantic"" aspect of their relationship only just recently began and that they were not romantically involved while she was his student. of course, i've recently discovered that my daughter is more than capable of lying to me and covering these things up, so i am aware that this may be untrue and i will try to do some further digging into that matter.

at this point, as much as it kills me to admit it, i don't think there's anything i can do to stop this. i have spoken with my ex husband but he is at a bit of a loss too as to what to do about all this. he wants to confront mr. smith, but we are still trying to work out if that's the best idea and if it will really do any good in this situation. i will be reading up on the laws in my state and the policies of the school district, but besides potentially getting mr. smith fired i'm not sure that there's anything else that can be done legally speaking. i want to keep him as far away from my daughter as possible but i feel completely powerless in that, which crushes me. trying to forbid her from seeing him seems like it would be pointless considering she is a legal adult. she is still dependent on her father and i and we could technically hold that against her to get her to stop seeing him, but that would no doubt permanently damage our relationship with her. informing mr. smith's wife is also a possibility we've considered and would likely cause him to lose contact with my daughter, but that would of course cause my daughter to resent her father and i as well. right now, i'm honestly so worried about her safety and her mental health that we may just end up having to do something that will result in her resenting us in order to protect her (and protect other female students in mr. smith's care). trust me when i say, her father and i are considering every possible option.

thank you to those of you taking the time to read all of this and thank you for continually offering your support and advice. any suggestions you have of a solution (or legal advice) that i may not have thought of are absolutely welcome and greatly appreciated. however, any ""i told you so's"" or any criticism of my parenting is unwelcome and unnecessary. believe me, you can't possibly be any harder on me than i am already being on myself at the moment.

tl;dr:  it turns out my daughter is in fact having an affair with her former teacher. because the romantic part of their relationship supposedly began after she graduated, her father and i are afraid that there's nothing that can be done to put an end to their relationship. we are considering all possibilities, even those that may cause our daughter to resent us. any helpful advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated at this time.

!!! edit:  

thank you for all of your responses. i am having a hard time keeping up with the comments, but my ex and i are very thankful for the helpful advice you all have given. after taking a lot of things you all have said into consideration, we've come up with a general plan on how to handle this. first and foremost, i will report this to the district office when it opens on monday. soon after we are trying to work out a small ""getaway"" trip i can do with my daughter, preferably to an area with poor cell service like up at a cabin to remove her from the situation unfolding. i don't want to hide all of this from her and plan to tell her how her father and i are handling things while we're on the trip, but i'd prefer that she not be able to have contact with mr. smith during this time. it may make for a miserable and awkward few days together, but i think keeping things open and honest with my child is important. my ex husband will be returning from europe this upcoming week, so he will try to deal with speaking to the wife and mr. smith (separately or together, whichever works out) while my daughter and i are on vacation. our hope is that all of this coming out in the open will scare mr. smith off, and that by the time my daughter and i return home he won't want to pursue things any further with her. this may seem like a cruel thing for us to do for her daughter, but at this point we feel it's what we have to do to protect her. we are still open to tweaking this plan however, so if you feel there is a better way we can handle this please feel free to share your opinions.

***extra note: i have received quite a few messages and comments suggesting that i get my daughter a therapist. i just wanted to clarify that she has actually been seeing a therapist for a couple years now ever since her father and i split up. i believe i mentioned this in a previous post. thanks anyways for the suggestion though!",7

"i got scammed out of $800 and i've never felt more stupid.. a guy ran into me outside the bank claiming to be a college student needing to pay his student debt. he said he had a paycheck from work that he couldn't cash since his account his bank account was negative. he showed me his phone and confirmed his account was negative and it was a student account. 

he needed to explain his story multiple times because i wasn't sure what he wanted from me so i didn't really understand. the guy showed me he couldn't get into his account at the bank atm, although he was using an atm card, the kind of card they give you temporarily while they mail you your new debit card.

he had a whole story lined up, like where he works, where he went to school and what he majored in. he even gave me a phone number to call him if anything went wrong afterwards.

what he wanted from me was for me to cash his money order using my account and have me withdraw the money. i realize how obvious of a scam this sounds but i have really bad anxiety and i wasn't thinking straight, i just wanted him to leave me alone because he kept pressing me.

i deposited the money order and gave him the money. we talked a bit afterwards and then parted ways. a few hours later i got a message from the bank that said they couldn't accept the money order.

i tried calling him but he didn't answer. judging from the voicemail, the number was from a texting/calling app. i know he can at least read my texts because he responded to my threats about contacting the police(although i already had and they can't do anything.) all he said in the message was his first name he told me when we met.

i feel so stupid because i knew better but i let my anxiety get the better of me. i don't feel like i've learned anything because it was such an obvious scam, i just needed to be assertive and tell him to fuck off but i'm not an assertive kinda guy so it's hard.

i doubt the bank can do anything because it was 100% my fault so i doubt they would just give me the money back. it just sucks because i'm a college student who doesn't have much money and i will need that $800.

sorry if this doesn't fit the subreddit, i didn't know where else to post.

"by accidentally ripping my butthole after lion king. when

ok so i got back from the movies seeing lion king and i needed to shower but i'm also in a funk so i wanted to smoke and drink coffee so i thought let's do a bath. 

then i remembered i move out this week and i have like loads of excess bath products that it doesn't make sense for me to move so i should just dump them all in the tub to generate some fantastical bubble wonderland. 


wrong, 3 half conditionors, a bottle of irish spring and like a bunch of shampoo do not make a bubble bath but it's fine because it smells nice and i like the bubbles that are there. 


however, 


i went to get out and i stepped on the mat to drip for a second but i really wanted my coffee which was on the counter (dumb fuck me for not putting it closer to the tub) 

so anyway i take a small step on the shitty college apartment tile and fucking boom my well lubed body slid so hard and i did a split and slammed my foot into the door which would have really hurt if my fat ass didn't transform into a fucking bouncy ball launching me back up only to slide slideways this time knocking my cooter on the floor corner of the sink counter. 

at first i couldn't tell if i was bleeding but looks like it's just a poo stain and severe bruising from the sole fact my ass just bent in ways gumby couldn't even do stamping a skid mark on the tile. 


fuck me for trying to have a relaxing day 

tldr i ripped my butthole and pooed on the floor after being depressed about the new lion king by slipping on the floor after a soppy bath

edit 1: i am a female.... logistics: i did a split with one leg in the front, other in the back (that's what did the ripping/bruising). then i slid cooter first into the corner of the cabinet of my small bathroom, that's how this all happened.

throwaway account so i don't reveal anything that can be tied to me.

anyway, i'm a single 25 year old man with a decent full-time job. i've never lived alone, i'm currently renting at my folks'. i'm fortunate enough to be able to afford a decent apartment or mortgage with my job. after seeking advice from friends and family, i've gotten almost exactly half-and-half suggestions for either option. i was hoping to get all the input i could before i made the decision, so i'd appreciate any advice.

i've pieced together some information regarding the decision:

* mortgages (altogether in my area) run from around $500-800 (the house i'm currently interested in is $650/mo fwiw)
* property taxes are ballpark $800/year for my preferred ""range"" of houses
* rent (altogether in my area) runs from around $900-1200
* that is, a $800 mortgage would be a fairly nice house whereas a $900 rental would be a small apartment or a sketchy neighborhood. i'm willing to spend about $700-900/mo on either rent or mortgage.
* if i were to buy a house, the expenses (barring buying furniture, things breaking, emergencies, etc.) would be equal to or slightly higher than just renting an apartment.
* i have no credit. i've heard that no credit is better than bad credit, but, i've heard that in my area most landlords/realtors will take a decent job and clean record as a ""replacement"" unless you're after an immaculate place which i'm not.
* i don't plan on moving out of the area at all within the next five years, *maybe* within the next 10 years, and likely will after 10-15 years. in my area, you can break even or slightly profit on a house after 5 years, and almost certainly will within 10 years.
* i plan on smoking trees, so, i'd prefer a house for this reason. medical state and i have a card, but i don't know that neighbors/landlords would respect that. even if they do tolerate it, i don't wanna be *that guy*.
* however, i enjoy the non-commitment of an apartment. i.e, if i don't like the neighbors or landlord, i can rent someplace else or choose to buy.
* i enjoy the concept of being able to renovate and ""improve"" a house however i like.",10

"for warning others about a girl's sti?. honestly don't think i acted assholish here given her actions, but the severe backlash i've received has me open to the idea that i am. hence i'm posting here.

to cut a long story short, i slept with a girl called madison at a toga party. we had both been drinking but not in anyway drunk. just a couple beers. the next morning a friend approached me and asked why i slept with her when she has herpes. i had no idea and obviously would not have slept with her had i known. i was annoyed she did not disclose this and feel she had a moral obligation to do so before sleeping with anyone.

when i confronted her she admitted she has genital herpes but said it wasn't a big deal, it never flares up, she hasn't passed it on to anyone etc. i don't really care for these excuses, and when i pushed her for an apology she said i was being a pansy.

following this incident, i took it upon myself to share her herpes status on our university's facebook pages anonymously. i did this so that other men (or women, if she swings that way) don't get tricked also. although it's obviously me that did it, she can't prove it, and i haven't gotten in trouble for it.

that said, she has organised a campaign against me for ""slut shaming"" and ""harassment"" against her for the posts, and successfully convinced a few groups of my guilt. the posts in question were literally bland and vanilla: ""beware of x. she has genital herpes and does not disclose this fact to those she sleeps with."" absolutely no mean words or slurs.",3

"by trying to look up the movie 'moonlight' and inadvertently exposing my entire family (including kids) to gay black porn.. ** this is a repost but update because since then it's gotten much worse ** this happened a few weeks ago during a very rare family get together; we were talking and discussing small topics like the oscars in the living room in front of the large tv while the kids ran around and played.

i have my laptop hooked up to the tv so we can look up anything like videos or trivia facts and questions and my aunt had mentioned the oscar winning film ""shape of water"" that had garnered much praise in 2018; which had me thinking...last years oscar winning film was 'moonlight' an incredible film about a young man struggling to grow up with a dark secret (he's gay).

however, for whatever reason i absolutely could not come up with the name of the film and i knew i had watched it but no matter how hard i tried i couldn't get the name out. at this point i look like an idiot trying to explain to them about last years movie and my whole families staring at me so i said all right screw it; my trusty friend google will help me out.

so without thinking of the imminent consequences and without thinking to just type in '2017 oscar winner' i typed in the search bar ""movie about two gay black boys 2017"" and, honestly at that point my internet speed could not have been any faster, tons of images of porn sites, men on men, ebony, large black **** filling the screen and the kids stopped dead in the their tracks and my sister screamed. my aunt was laughing her skirt off and i turned beet red. we all kind of laughed and brushed it off until just recently my sister calls me up saying thanks to me now she has to explain sex to an 8 year old that she caught her looking up minecraft porn on her tablet; ruining her innocence.

tldr: was trying to find the name of last years oscar winner 'moonlight', couldn't think of the name so i googled my best description of it in front of my entire family on the large tv connected to my laptop, without much thought of consequence typed ""movie about two gay black boys 2017"" and intense men on men porn showed up. sister calls me up weeks later explaining that now her 8yr old was caught looking up minecraft porn and i had ruined a young girls innocence.

"for buying my brother-in-law condoms when i heard he doesn't use them?. my wife has a younger brother (29) who has been in a relationship with his high school sweetheart (who's also a 29 year old male) for about 12 years. i think of both of them as my family, they're my children's uncles, we spend a bunch of time together and we get along great. i recently had a vasectomy, i'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. after one sunday lunch with our bils, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy. at one point, i said how great it was to finally not have to worry about protection, and how great it felt without it. and i said i almost feel sorry for them not experiencing it. my bil laughed and said: what are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.

i was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so i dropped the topic. i later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that i don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? she told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.

i thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. so i figured i would buy some condoms and give them to my bils and tell them i was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.

a couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and i gave them the condoms. i rehearsed a whole speech about how i wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. but, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. they asked if i am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? they said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. and my wife's brother also said that, by the same token, i should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. after shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. my wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded i apologize to them, but i refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. i don't see how what i did was this horrible. they could have just declined the condoms. and their arguments are ridiculous. so what if they've been together for 12 years? people have cheated on each other after being together for longer than that.",3

"how to prioritize spending your money - a flowchart (redesigned). **edit 3: .png version of flowchart: https://i.imgur.com/u0ocdri.png**

roughly two weeks ago, /u/beached89 shared(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4e8n3n/how_to_spend_your_money_the_flow_chart/) an informative flowchart on how to prioritize spending of personal income.

i like what he shared and think having a flowchart of that calibre can be a useful tool, so i decided to make some alterations and revise it into something i felt would be more polished in terms of reflecting what is in the pf wiki as accurately as possible.

my goals for this revision included:

* major aesthetic redesign to more closely reflect the simplified graphical version(https://i.imgur.com/fb7dtmh.png) of the how to handle $(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) pf wiki entry
* removal of arbitrary numbers and streamlining of certain node paths
* reordering of certain nodes to more closely reflect the pf wiki
* reworking of some information to more closely reflect the pf wiki
* replacement of the ""entertainment expenses"" node with a footnote on entertainment expenses due to its highly discretionary nature and its absence from the pf wiki

no single personal income spending flowchart can truly be a ""one-size-fits-all"" thing, there are scenarios where certain nodes might need to be moved around, but the vision was to have something *as close as possible* to a ""gold"" standard.

keeping that in mind, here it is—

**the flowchart v4:** pf - income spending priority flowchart(https://i.imgur.com/ccevqav.jpg)        
*previous versions*             
1(https://i.imgur.com/fsf0hng.jpg) 2(https://i.imgur.com/qaxycwz.jpg) 3(https://i.imgur.com/1rpekgq.png)

*changelog:* 
    
* ~~relocated ""pay any non-essential bills in full"" node after employer match nodes~~
* added title text to indicate this flowchart is us-centric  
* reattached missing arrow      
* changed phrasing from ""low risk, low volatility investments"" to ""savings or checking account""

due to the progression of the how to handle $(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) entry, there is some overlap present in the flowchart, particularly related to the emergency fund steps. i've tried a couple different things, but haven't been able to successfully rework the layout without the flowchart becoming unnecessarily convoluted/hectic. 

i'd love to get any feedback or insights regarding this, or anything else. your thoughts would be appreciated :)

again, the inspiration came from /u/beached89, so thanks to him for laying the groundwork for this. i'd also like to extend thanks to /u/dequeued who has given extensive feedback to help shape this into something that aligns well with the pf wiki.

i hope this is beneficial, and thanks for any feedback or thoughts you leave. if the consensus is there, i'll make sure to update as soon as i'm able to.

***edit 1:*** i am reading the feedback! thanks for all the comments, i truly appreciate it. i have uploaded a new version of the flowchart. changes may be slow, we want to make sure that any changes made stay true to the pf wiki, so thank you for the patience :)

***edit 2:*** after some discussion, i have reverted the changes implemented which relocated the ""pay any non-essential bills in full"" node. as much as it seems logical that it would be something done after employer matching, it's not realistic or reasonable, particularly when we consider that many people will be utilizing a chart such as this will already be on contracts for internet/phone services. as such, these bills do need to be paid before employer matching.

"i sympathize with incels. of course not the radical ones who hate women,

but the average guys who are probably depressed, lonely and relatively anti social.

not everyone can be this charismatic, gregarious person and not everyone wants to. so when people tell men that looks don't matter(an absolute lie) and reality blatantly reveals otherwise. of course you're going to begin resenting people. 

there's a strong chance most incels are good hearted intelligent people who are frustrated, envious because they have difficulty cultivating options. the most powerful tool in a man's disposal while dating. if a man isn't naturally attractive(6ft+ beard decent face) to an abundance of women looks wise he will have to face constant rejection, bad dates and dry spells.

wouldn't you be angry as well? many women have natural abundance from a young age. of course this comes with its problems(creepy old men, weirdos and creeps in general) not denying that. 

but if you had to hit a target with a revolver or a machine gun which one is easier? 

go fishing with a fishing rod or dynamite and a net?

there has been a plethora of books written for men trying to become more attractive to women. the internet has exploded and men have begun congregating about their difficulties dating, when similar trends appear from just observing life(""man tall guys sure do get a lot of women"", ""man that cocky dude is beating them off with a stick"") you begin to harbor vitriol toward god, society, mankind, women and everything else. these people then form echo chambers and hate grows until terror attacks or whatever happen.(ahem sound like anything else?)

men are kind of in a weird place right now, our traditional roles are changing, we are frustrated with dating and becoming more sexless and celibate, we live in a world of abundance with instant gratification at every corner many have lost their purpose and passion in life.

no product was ever pushed, no company was ever mentioned. this just sounds like a mlm, but there is no product that we've been made aware of. and i really don't get the scam artist vibe - they don't want our bank accounts.

"by helping my wife breast-feed our newborn. i was tidying up our back porch and noticed i hadn't yet put anything in one of our planters. i remembered some assorted dried pepper seeds i had in the kitchen cupboard. the thing is, i couldn't remember what pepper was what now that they were all dried up. so i grabbed a yellow one and a red one. i tore them open, planted them, and went inside: no problem. 

now our newborn is feeding every hour, so my wife has to use a nipple shield (it's a piece of silicone with holes in it that extends the nipple and protects the nipple from getting too raw). i heard the baby's timely cry, so like clockwork, i grabbed the nipple shield, washed it, and placed it on my wife's nipple for her so she could feed the baby without having to get up. i am the worst dad ever: little did i know, but some of the pepper oil that got on my hands (i didn't know dried peppers could still have oil in them) got on the nipple shield. our baby started to wail and nothing could make him stop. we couldn't figure out what was wrong until my mouth began to burn. i guess i had also gotten my fingers near my mouth. so i full on stuck my fingers in my mouth to determine what kind of pepper. judging by the heat in my own mouth and knowledge of the peppers i had dried, i had planted a carolina reaper. my tender little boy cried bloody murder for at least two and a half hours straight and we did everything we could think of/find on the internet to stop the burning. 
luckily, from what we can tell, not very much got on the nipple shield and the pepper wasn't to it's full potency or things could have been much much worse. now i feel like i should never touch my child again- this whole fatherhood thing is not off to a great start. 

tl;dr
touched some dried carolina reaper seeds. then touched my wife's nipple shield that goes in baby's mouth. baby cried horribly for two and half hours straight. i'm the worst dad ever.

edit: i did wash my hands after, but i used hand soap instead of dish soap. even with dish soap, it didn't come off. the pepper oil finally came off after i poured 91% rubbing alcohol on my hands.

edit 2: he wouldn't latch to drink milk because he was crying so hard, so i eventually got a bottle of pumped milk and put some of it around and in his mouth.

edit 3: baby is okay. he's still feeding normally and acts as if nothing happened. but we all know the truth... we know.",4
"for being angry at a woman flirting with me and reporting her to the college authority?. so, first of all....let me just tell you guys i am ugly. ugly as ugly can be.
i won the ugliest guy in high school competition 4 years in a row and was relentlessly bullied.
fortunately college is a lot better. i still don't have any friends but i get to keep to myself and no one bullies me as such. i get to make my own little world and i feel fortunate:)

when i was walking to the library today, an extremely attractive woman started hitting on me. at first i was in disbelief and asked her if she had the wrong person. but she said she would be willing to carry my babies in a joking tone and had a chat with me.
after about 2 minutes and me literally holding back tears because i had never felt so loved in my life, she tells me she was filming a 'fun' youtube video where she told random guys she would have their babies.
apparently the channel is pretty popular and people like stuff like this.
i told her i wasn't comfortable with being in the video and that this was harmful and would ruin people's self esteem. she tells me i should feel good because i am 'definitely not the best looking guy on campus' and that they needed 10-15 more people to finish the video.

i was honestly indifferent at the ugly part because i was used to it but this felt like a shitty thing but i didn't want other guys to go through it and cameras were technically not allowed so i reported to the campus authorities about it and they have banned anyone from their channel from shooting videos at our university again.

honest opinion would be appreciated! sorry if i made any grammatical errors, i am in a hurry. thanks for your time guys.

edit:thank you to each and every one of you for spending your valuable time to help me, genuinely means a lot",3
"for not wanting to pay for a vacation where i spent almost all of my time helping my friend recover from her butt enhancement surgery?. since this is a very specific situation, i'm using a throwaway for privacy reasons. 

**note - my friend has now said that although she is ""extremely disappointed"" in my actions, she's going to drop the money issue.  so it's not like i'm being sued or anything. i'm just posting to see if i am in the wrong with how i handled things.**

my friend recently got this butt procedure done in mexico for cosmetic reasons. i personally thought it was a little unnecessary but i try to be a good friend and support her regardless. 

she ended up inviting me to come stay at a hotel with her for a week while she recovered. then we would fly home together. i am a teacher and have summers off so i agreed to do it. there was no mention of money. (because my husband happens for an airline, i hardly ever pay for flights, so the plane tickets were covered). 

i get there and the hotel suite my friend rented is beautiful. i have my own room and everything. but my friend was in no position to do much of anything. i had to basically play nurse as she couldn't even use the restroom on her own. whenever i got a chance, i would try to eat out and go swimming or explore, but since my friend needed me, my time was limited. i managed to squeeze in one hike and that's it. obviously, it was not exactly a traditional vacation for the reasons i've outlined. 

on our last day there, my friend asked me when i thought i could ""pay her back"" for half the cost of the suite. i'm like uhhhh excuse me?? why would i pay you to play mommy/nurse for seven days?? she was pissed and we got into a big argument which obviously ruined the end of the trip.

my husband thinks it's insane that she would ask me to pay her anything. however, a mutual friend of ours is on the side of the friend who had surgery. so i'm starting to doubt myself. 

am i somehow wrong to expect that she'd cover the cost of the hotel under these circumstances? i mean, would you ask a friend to pay who spent time taking care of you?",3
"by drinking an energy drink and almost dying.. this very recently. 

it was my day off, and i usually start my morning by drinking an energy drink and playing some video games. 

so i popped open a monster drink and sat down to play. 

about 20 minutes later, i started feeling very anxious for no reason. then all of a sudden, my chest started pounding really hard for no reason. 

i've had panic attacks before, but this was different, it felt like my heart was pounding, at a rhythm it wasn't supposed to. this scared the crap out of me and i thought i might be having an attack or something. i tried breathing slowly, but it wouldn't stop. 

so i drove myself to the hospital. (i know that was really stupid, but understand that by this point i wasn't thinking straight, my brain was losing oxygen and i was in a delirious panic. )

upon arriving at the er, i checked in and they immediately rushed me back to a bed, and this is when it got really scary. 

i couldn't really understand what was happening, but i knew i was losing feeling in my limbs and my vision was going dark while nurses crowded around me, and they told me they needed to stop my heart. i cried out terrified, saying i didn't want to die.

i woke up a little while later with a tube in my arm in the same room. the doctor had explained to me that i had a severe super ventricular tachycardia, or in other words, my heart had been beating irregularly and in excess of 230bpm. at that fast of a rate, the blood doesn't have enough time to absorb oxygen, hence the delirium and loss of feeling. so they tried to chemically halt my heart, but that didn't work, so they had to use a cardioversion machine to stop and restart it. 

after talking to the doctor about my diet and personal habits, he summarized that i had been malnourished to the point of having very unbalanced electrolyte levels. 
electrolytes are basically what allows your nervous system to control your motor function, and having poor electrolyte levels and introducing a strong stimulant made my heart go crazy. 

i haven't touched energy drinks since, and i try really hard to have a balanced diet now. 

tldr: poor diet and energy drink consumption made my heart go crazy, almost killing me. electrolytes are important kids.

edit: holy shit, i was just trying to share a scary experience. i had no idea  this post would blow up so much! 
umm, thanks i guess, i don't know what to say. 

i agree with those of you saying it wasn't strictly the energy drink that caused this, it was mostly my bad diet depriving me of potassium and phosphates specifically. but the energy drink is the match that lit the tinder i laid out. 

some are telling me this event is rarely life threatening. 
that may be true, but i will say that some may be confusing what i wrote about with a super atrial tachycardia, which is far less serious than a ventricular tachycardia, which is serious enough that i am not allowed to donate blood or plasma due to me being permanently labeled a saftey risk. this isn't from my knowledge, this is from several doctors who told me so.


i appreciate the well wishes and the concern, i am eating a balanced diet, i exercise daily, and i only have the occasional coffee or tea now, i do not wish to repeat that stupid mistake. 

edit again:

a lot of people have been asking what my diet was like before this happened.

it wasn't so much to do with what i was eating, but that i wasn't eating enough, i work very long hours and i usually only spared myself the time to have one good meal a day, usually something my wife cooked at home. the doctor said that because i wasn't eating frequently enough my body wasn't able to build up enough potassium and phosphorus to keep my system stable. the long periods of fasting coupled with long strenuous hours of working severely depleted my electrolytes. 

so the lesson is that you should not only eat a balanced diet, but also eat regularly. 

edit x3: first time reddit gold!! thank you kind stranger! 
all i had to do was nearly kill myself from shitty habits.

"my(27f) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31m). everyone thinks i should break up with him but i don't want to. what do i do?. my husband (my son's dad) passed away when he was 2. i thought i could never date or be with anyone ever again until i met my current boyfriend a year ago. he is a wonderful person and we got serious pretty quickly.  i introduced him to my son about three months into dating him and they got along fine. he is really good with my son and he genuinely enjoys spending time with him. my son was also happy to spend time with him and he got along with him fine until about a month and a half ago. i don't know what happened, he went to visit his grandparents for a week and when he came back he became quite withdrawn and didn't want to spend time with my boyfriend anymore. he told me that he doesn't want me seeing him anymore. i thought maybe he was just reminded of his dad after spending time with his grandparents. even though he was 2 when he passed away i've always tried to make sure he knows about his dad. i thought he would be ok after a few days. but he still hasn't warmed back up to my boyfriend. 

i think he still does like him but is apprehensive about spending time with him for some reason. the other day he was really excited and asked me whether ""(my boyfriend) will be coming"" with us to watch a movie but then seem to check himself and refuse when i offered to call and ask.  i have tried to find out from his why he's being like this and he just says he doesn't know or i just don't want to (see him).  i am at a loss for what to do. 

this has been very hard on me and my boyfriend. he has grown quite fond of my son and this rejection is making us both feel really shit. my mother and older sister are pressuring me to do what's best for my son and break up with him. my older brother thinks that this will pass and also that my husbands parents may have said something. i can't imagine them doing something like that. i also think maybe he just needs more time and to just spend more time with my boyfriend (although i also don't want to force him) . 

am i being selfish? i love my son very very much. but i also don't want to break up with my boyfriend and i also think that he's good for my son. am i being a horrible mum?

go into the gym today and see another coach got a promotion to the same position at $33.5k. i saw it on a paper left out by accident i assume. i work much more than he does, i do more for the gym outside of coaching, i clean, i work 7 days a week vs his 4 or 5. it was very upsetting to me and demotivating. i do a much better job than he does, as said by my bosses themselves.

i love this job and work extremely hard but this is definitely hit me kinda hard. i feel undervalued. how do i approach my employer about this? 

update: scheduled a meeting with the owner tomorrow. going to try negotiate a better pay. i will mention that i saw the other workers salary and make my case for why i'm undervalued. i'll update you guys on what happens 

update: just had the meeting. told him i feel undervalued and what i bring to the company. he didn't seem like he was gonna budge but he's having a meeting today with the other owners to figure some stuff out and said he would have another meeting with me. i didn't bring up that i saw the other workers pay.

we just finished up with our initial meeting with the attorney. we all agree that we are going to try to get an annulment. the guy has such a common name that it's going to be close to impossible to find him. they will do a search, followed by a publication. then the petition for annulment will be filed. 

annulment is best case scenario because it will be like it never happened and we can go about our lives.   he thinks she has a good chance of it being approved since they never lived together, filed taxes together or even consummated the marriage. 

the tricky thing is if the judge doesn't approve the annulment. because of our marriage, adoption of our kids, tax filings, etc., we might be in for a world of shit if she has to file for divorce. let's hope it doesn't come to that.

"my mom keeps telling people i'm a lawyer when i'm not. worried about liability or potential character and fitness issues (ca). hello everyone,

i'm currently a law student (2l) and my mom is really starting to make me worry.

she's a very verbally aggressive and entitled person. anytime something doesn't go her way, she immediately starts screaming law suit when 100% of the time she's at fault or doesn't have a claim anyways.

recently, she took her cat to the vet to get vaccinated. a few days later, the cat was very sick and would scream if carried. my mother took the cat to the vet, but informed them she was refusing to pay for the visit or any tests because she just knew it was their vaccine that made the cat sick and therefore the office was at fault and should eat the cost. 

understandably, they said no. my mother announced she was going to sue them, that it was unconstitutional for them to deny her cat free care (i don't even), and that i, her child, was an attorney and was going to sue them for everything they had. she left them my information. 

i got a call from the vet's attorney who wanted to talk about the matter. i immediately interrupted them and let them know that (1) i was not an attorney, (2) i never agreed to represent my mother in the matter, (3) i could not legally represent my mother in the matter, and (4) i was terribly sorry about this. i explained how my mother did this all the time. the attorney understood and let me go.

while nothing bad came out of it, i'm worried someone will report me to c&f for unauthorized practice of law if my mother keeps this up. i have repeatedly asked her to knock if off, but she just won't. she's also given her friends my information to get legal advice from me and i have to keep telling them that i can't help them. 

can i get in any kind of trouble because of my mom's assertions that i'm an attorney? what can i legally do to protect myself? ",2

"for being upset at my wife's friend for telling us we can adopt her unborn child, only for her to terminate it a week later?. i'm getting a lot of flack from my wife for being visibly upset at this woman and i am currently in a state of being where i just don't want to be around her right now. 

this woman had a rebound relationship and got pregnant. she told my wife that she preferred to go condomless and, wouldn't you know it, when she missed her period, she insisted there was no way she could be pregnant. 

my wife and i had a feeling after her third missed week that she was pregnant. at work, she asked her, 

""if you *are* pregnant, are you thinking of getting an abortion?""

the friend responded, ""absolutely not. i would literally never do that. if *anything*, adoption.""

relieved, we offered to take her child. we realized that it was financially difficult for her so we even offered to help her out money-wise as well as emotional and familial support before and after the baby was born. i'll let it be known that she actually made us believe that if she *were* pregnant, we'd adopt it. this got me emotionally attached to the idea because she said that, at the very bottom line, she'd never ever even think about abortion.

it got brought up weekly for about a month (they're really close, this wasn't intruding- just causal conversation) until she went silent. we didn't hear from her for about 10 days. she sends my wife a text and says she got an abortion.

while i understand her fear (and realistically i *don't* fully understand since i'm a guy), i feel like i got bait-and-switched with a potential child of mine. i know it wasn't mine, but the reason i'm so upset is because she actually had us believing that this child could have been a part of our lives. this goes beyond an abortion debate. it got real and emotional investment happened. 

i have a hard time seeing her, so when she comes over, my wife intentionally keeps distance by hanging out with her on the porch while i go work or hangout in the basement. i understand she's probably hurt to, but i feel hurt to, and i just need time to get to a place where i can be civil and polite, because right now, in my heart, i'm not.

**edit:**

i think people are misreading, or maybe i wrote it poorly. here was our outlook.

a. if she wants to keep the pregnancy, we will be there for emotional support and, since she's single and not really established, financial support. we would first to just be helpers, not trying to steal anyone's baby here. 

b. if she didn't want to keep the baby because of financial stress and emotional toll, we would gladly give it a home.

since she was clearly against abortion, we thought those were the two best options to keep the baby in a stable environment.

"by ruining my moms friend's sweater. this happened a few years ago when i was 19.

i went on vacation with my family over the holidays, so we were out of town for christmas. we were gone for ten days and i never got the chance to jerk off on the trip. we got back home late (around one in the morning) so we all just brought out stuff in and immediately went to bed. the next morning, everyone goes out to breakfast but i stayed home to sleep some more... is what i said. i actually wanted to stay home because i woke up with a massive hard on and i wanted a good amount of time to masturbate without being bothered.

so i'm about 15-20 minutes in when my mom calls me. i take my hand off my dick and answer the phone. i can't be touching myself while talking to her lol. she tells me that allison (family friend, her and my mom go way back) is going to be stopping at the house to drop off some late christmas gifts for us, so i have to answer the door/let her in, etc. i tell her all right and figure i have time to finish before i have to do this. well i'm just about to climax when the doorbell rings. ah shit. guess i'll take care of this then finish myself off after.

i quickly put on a pair of sweatpants, pull the 'ol flip and tuck and put on a shirt. i answered the door and she immediately comes in and gives me a hug. now, the shirt i was wearing was a little bit tight so it wasn't the best fit. when i reached out to hug her that pulled the shirt up a little bit, exposing the head of my erect (and very sensitive) penis.

now, there are a couple of things that came in to play: she was wearing an extremely soft cashmere sweater. she hugged me very tightly and began to rock back and forth a little bit, as we hadn't seen each other in a very long time and she's a close family friend. so after a few seconds of this i feel my cock starting to twitch and i realized she set my virgin dick over the edge. my brain begins to cloud as the orgasm quickly builds but i'm trying to do anything to get out of this... i pulled away from the hug just as i started cumming but it was too late. keep in mind i hadn't had came in ten days so this was a huge 'gasm.

i grunted an apology as my dick sprayed her and myself with man chowder. she was extremely taken aback but she just went to the bathroom and tried to clean it off as best she could. i apologized profusely and told her i wasn't sure what happened. she said it was fine.  the real fuck up was that a week later she called me and told me that i had to buy her a new sweater because it was a gift from her husband and she didn't want to explain what happened.  plus, you can't get cum out of cashmere.

tl;dr family friend hugged me while my dick was extremely sensitive and it set me over the edge. came all over her and myself.  she made me replace her sweater which cost over $200.

1. i did not do this intentionally, it was circumstantial.  i also didn't just stand there and empty my clip on her.  she only caught the first couple ropes and then got out of the line of fire as i was getting it back in my pants, where i finished.

2.  i didn't have time to put on boxers, and sweatpants just made more sense so my only option was to tuck. 

3.  i did not keep the original sweater.

"being fat is gross and shouldn't be defended.. i am 6' 4"" and just over 400 lbs.

i know that my problem is diet and not exercising.  i'm generally a lazy person and work a desk job so over the years i have ballooned up to this weight.
since i've had the experience of being an absolute unit, i can tell you that it sucks, it's gross and it shouldn't be defended or glorified.

being fat like this is literally tiring. it's  embarrassing when i get on a plane or go to an arena with small seats and i can hardly fit in.  i start breathing heavy doing the most minimal of excercise.  i can feel it in my legs and knees getting up or going up stairs.  i eat too much too often and feel gross after.  lastly, i know in my head i have to change my ways or i will have some medical complications down the road.

so having this lived experience, it drives me batty that people talk on the internet about body positivity in relation to obesity.  i'm not saying you should bully fat people into the ground, but it sure looks like it is being excused an awful lot.  this is bad for me and anyone else who just truly hasn't put their best effort into trying to control their diet and exercise.  

instead of morally posturing about how fat shaming is bad, can we go the route of encourage healthy eating, benefits of exercise, encouraging accountability, etc.  i think it would be more beneficial for obese folks, including myself, to better understand the benefits of healthy exercise.  stop white knighting on every little negative comment about being overweight.

tl;dr i'm experienced being fat and the internet should be encouraging healthy lifestyles instead of defending obesity as body positivity.

edit: thank you for the silver and all of your encouragement!  if this sounds like my opinion is fat=bad, my apologies.  i meant to make it more about how people shouldn't be defending fatness.",6

"my mil tampered with my birth control resulting in me getting pregnant 3mo postpartum. not really sure what to do from here.. let me just start out by saying if you know who i am, please don't say anything. i created a throwaway to vent and cry and get support as anonymously as possible. i'm still very happy about the pregnancy, or at least want to be. i just need support. thanks for understanding. 

my husband (22m) and i (20f) welcomed our daughter into the world 18 weeks ago. she's a darling baby and really pretty easy as far as new borns go, except for one: she wasn't a son. my ils were obsessed with the idea of us having a son, to the point that they denied she was a girl up until the moment she was born. why? because, ""the bloodline follows the father. if you don't have a son, our family name will die out, because your daughter will marry a man and carry on *his* bloodline. so girls don't really count."" the day they came to visit in the hospital, my ils asked when we would be trying for another baby. we kind of just laughed it off, but my mil got more insistent, straight up telling us ""y'all need to try for a boy!"" 

over the next month or two the conversation about us having another baby sort of tapers off into little comments every now and again. i had no problem ignoring them, and we'd already told them it wasn't happening so i just let it run off my back. around this time, mil started coming over daily for a few hours, watching the baby for me so that i could sleep and also occasionally clean up a bit for me. she'd be over unsupervised anywhere from 1 - 4hrs. 

fast forward to present day. two days ago now, my husband poured me a mixed drink, and when i brought the cup up to my lips, i got hit with this paranoid and panicked feeling. i immediately put the cup down and insisted we take a pregnancy test. sure enough, it comes back positive. we wait until the next morning, take a digital test and again, positive. based on lmp i should have been about 6 weeks along. after getting over the initial shock, we were excited but confused. for several reasons, we hadn't been able to get hormonal birth control, so we'd been using condoms and lube to make sure they didn't tear. so we weren't sure how we'd gotten pregnant, but we're happy with the news. we decided we wouldn't tell anyone because we didn't want another baby stampede from his family, but i'm incredibly close with my sil so i decided to tell her after swearing her to secrecy. 

when i told her, her yes got wide and started to water and she asked if i was serious, and was i sure. i told her i know my husband and i are young, but between us we make more than enough to support another baby. sil bursts into tears and starts to apologize over and over, meanwhile i sit there with my mouth hanging open and lost. she calms down a bit, and through her tears tell me that *my mil has been poking holes in our condoms pretty much since we came home from the hospital*. she claims mil told her she did it, but she thought that she was just spouting shit because she was upset we didn't have a boy. and suddenly everything clicked into place. that's why the condoms didn't work even though we were careful with them. that's why she'd always shoo me off to sleep while she was around. and that's what she was doing when she was ""cleaning"" my house - snooping for our condoms. and she knew i wasn't on birth control because i remember complaining to her about how my ob went on maternity leave and i wasn't able to find another one that took my insurance at the time. 

i'm so angry i don't know what to do. i want to go right over to her house and tear her a new one so bad i can smell my tires burning in the blacktop. i'm also illogically angry at sil for not telling me - how could you think this was a joke when she was so specific about everything she was going to do?! why didn't you warn me? i would have put my condoms in my room. i'm livid with mil. i'm pleased with this pregnancy but it wasn't my choice. it wasn't even an accident, it was her meddling because she didn't get the golden grandson she wanted. i don't even know how to handle this. i want to scorch the earth but i also still don't want his family knowing i'm pregnant. and i'm not even 12 weeks yet so the risk of a miscarriage is still uncomfortably high. the only bright side of this whole thing is it's snatched my husband out of his mothers fog so violently he's probably got whiplash. personally, my pregnancy has soured a bit so i'm really trying to hang on to any happiness i have about the pregnancy left. if you have irish twins of your own or are one, i'd love some positive feedback on that situation. 

where do we go from here?

eta update:

first, let me clarify: i am 20yrs old, not eighteen. i'm 18 weeks postpartum, not 12. 12 is when i would have conceived given that i'm 6 weeks along based on lmp. second, i don't give a shit if you think this is fake, i honestly wish that it were. if you don't have advice to give i kindly ask that you take your judgement elsewhere. 

now that that's out the way, here's the update:

i want to thank you all for your support and suggestions. having a plan makes me feel way less panicked and overwhelmed. sadly, what mil did isn't a crime here, so there won't be any jail time of charges pressed. for now, game plan is nc with mil for me, babe, or growing babe once the truth is out. before then, i want all the proof in the world she did this. i've ordered a hidden camera, and am going to buy new, latex free condoms claiming that i'm suddenly allergic to latex. hopefully she'll poke holes again and i'll have video proof this time. even if i can't use it to press charges, i want all the proof i have that she's not safe to be around so she can't sue for gpr if this baby *is* a boy. i also have decided to change our family last name to literally anything else bc i'm a petty bitch and since she wants to act an ass over this stupid name, then nobody gets it. as for my husband, he's willing and ready to do whatever i decide. currently he's asleep, so we'll be discussing everything at breakfast. thanks again everyone.",7

"three people die and appear before buddha. stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.

-raise your heads. you were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. you have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. you have much to accomplish yet though.

one of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.

-benevolent buddha, what more could i possibly do in my next life? i thought i lived and acted to the fullest. because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.

-my work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. right now, the world i leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.

-my connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.

-i know all of your actions well. but that is still not enough. here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that i ask for. they are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.

the three people now both curious and excited follow buddha to a small building. their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. so ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. before the buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.

-impossible, yells the 1st person! such a plain human being! you! what was your work during your earthly life?

-who? m-me? i only had two part time jobs, nothing else that i can remember. during the morning hours i worked in a small plantation. fruits and vegetables.

-you're joking! shouts the 2nd person. and the second job?

-oh...that one was a bit odd. my village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. but because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. my job was to put them back in their place.

-this is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! how could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?

-w-well, i don't know what to tell you. but i've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.

"by having to give my 5yo son $100 for beating my high score.. happened a couple of hours ago. 

i've been playing this game i stumbled across recently. 
you know the ones, free, highly addictive, but jam packed full of advertising. 

anyhows, i thought i was an absolute champion when i scored 34 earlier today. the first thing i thought of was boasting to my boy when he came home from pre school since he likes the game too. i was all in his face like ""i'm the game king"".  

i figured my 5 year old had no chance of beating my score as the highest i'd seen him get was a measly 21 - and he fluked it, so i told him i'd give him $100 (australian) if he could beat my score. 

never underestimate the power of a huge financial incentive. i heard uncontrollable laughter about 15 minutes later. sure enough the little guy had cracked my high score. 38. 

parents of reddit will understand you can't go back on your word with children. his piggy bank just got $100 fatter and i've had to put up with ""i'm pretty good aren't i dad?!""  :)

tl;dr got cocky, told my boy i'd give him a $100 if he beat my high score. he did. never underestimate children and the power of a financial incentive. 


edit: understandably my original post was removed by mod. made some small changes so it didn't appear that i was an advertising genius.

"for turning off the dryer on someone who removed my laundry before it was done?. i live in an apartment complex that has a common wash room for clothing... laundromat style. today i did a load of laundry, and all was normal until i went to go get my stuff out of the dryer. someone had taken the liberty of unloading the dryer and setting my clothing on a random washing machine. my clothes were dry, yes, but i had set a timer for about 4 minutes before the dryer ended so i could free it up asap. i walked into the wash room knowing i had time left on the dryer, expecting to see my clothes still drying. upon noticing the disparity i became pretty mad.... so what did i do? i noticed the other residents clothing still had 37 minutes left, they probably bought 40 minutes. i decided to open the dryer door, stopping the drying cycle, close it, and not start it. the question is, am i the asshole for ensuring my fellow resident a soggy pair of underwear after they stole dryer time from me, and took the liberty of throwing my personal laundry around without my knowledge.

edit: there were like 10 other dryers free

"a tip for your car payoff and credit score. perhaps i am naive to the ways of the world, but i thought i'd share my life lesson here for others who might meet the same fate as i.  check your auto loan!  check your credit score! 

my so (then bf/now husband) picked out a new (er) car for me once we were engaged.  i'd driven the car my parents got when i was 15 since i was 16.  it was a sunfire and let's be real...after 12 years of me driving it and 1 year of my parents driving it...it was time to go.  

i had great credit and qualified easily for a loan and set up payments with the loaning bank for automatic bill pay.  i got the car five years ago and was very excited knowing it would be paid off at the start of this year.  over the past 5 years since  making the purchase i have gotten married, bought a forever home, had a child, and am pregnant with our second.  i'm pretty on top of things and in charge of finances as my husband is notoriously bad with money.  this january i see the car payment come out and read up on paying off an auto loan.  i learned that sometimes a credit score will drop right after a big loan is paid off, but that it will bounce back within a few months.  

cue february.  no car payment comes out.  no worries.  i knew we had one or two payments left on the car so i assumed the final payment was made!  yay!  i checked my credit score on credit karma to find that my score dropped some, but it was to be expected.  i am now over the moon to have completed my first car loan!  

today i decided to check my score again to see if it had in fact bounced back up.  to my horror i discover my score has fallen an additional 78 points!  i start digging and discover the car loan is claiming i never made the last payment.  after being up all night with anxiety about the situation i get in contact with the bank this morning.  it turns out that this bank only accepts the final payment via phone or mail even with auto bill pay set up.  this bank also will not let you set up online banking with them unless you also open a checking account with them.  a loan account alone will not suffice.  

so the moral of the story is that despite being extremely financially responsible and doing everything i thought i should be doing - shit happens i guess.  make sure your final loan payment meets all the requirements of the bank and do not assume that auto bill pay ensures that your bill is paid.  

side note: this bank also does not send paper or email or phone notices when a payment is missed.  so despite 5 years of on time payments - there was no notification that the final payment did not occur.  it was only checking my credit score that alerted me to the situation.  had i not checked it i hate to think the outcome given the account was now 90 days late.  so now i'm coming to grips with my ""fair"" credit score and mostly thankful that i have no major purchases in the near future where my score would be needed.  

tldr:  make sure your final loan payment does not have to be made via phone or mail.  it turns it that auto bill pay does not necessarily mean that payment is made if the bank has stipulations saying otherwise.

edit:  bank is bmo harris.  it is not local to me.

edit 2: for those asking - i live in illinois where it has taken 2 months to get a new drivers license mailed to me.  where it takes months and months to renew a foid card despite the only change being that you are a few years older and actually had it updated three years earlier when changing last names.  this was my first car loan and i had no prior knowledge on the timeframe needed to process a legal document given how long everything else in this state takes.  i had decided to reach out or look into it more if i didn't get anything within the next month or so when all this went down.  i'm feeling rather foolish about the entire thing and hope that sharing can help some others from potentially going down the same path.

update:  first - thanks for the advice on helping my credit score (as scammy as credit score can be).  i just got the opportunity to sit down and call the bank (rascally two year old needed worn out before a long phone call was possible).  it took some transferring around and initially they were going to have me submit some paperwork for review.  i made sure to ask all the little questions suggested and point out 59 perfect payments previously and the lack of contact from them.  this lead to the credit dispute person speaking to her supervisor.  after she returned to the call she said her supervisor said to go ahead and bypass my submission and that they would submit a retraction with the credit places and that it should be resolved within 14 days.  

i rephrased everything she said they were doing to get a second confirmation i was understanding correctly.  she verified and even said this is a recorded call so she is being completely direct with me and not just telling me what i want to hear.  so hopefully in the next 14 days i will have a title in hand and my credit score will be sparkling again.  thanks again for everyone who encouraged me to call back and continue to ask to speak with whoever needed to make this go away.",10
"nsfw caught my boyfriend of over 10 years masterbating to my female guest in the middle of the night.. ok, so this is an issue i thought i would never have happen to me. it was in the middle of the night and my boyfriend got out of bed without realizing i was still awake. he went to use the restroom and ended up taking a longer time than expected. i got up to see what the issue was, and there he was, jerking off while looking at my sleeping female guest in the living room. i watched for about 5 seconds and then made a noise to alert him i was watching him. he saw me, tucked his member back in his pants, and walked back to the bedroom.

im completely in shock. i had no idea the man i've spent so many years with, was such a pervert. i feel violated and disgusted.

i don't know how to even approach the next steps. we have an apartment together and have really built a life together. i cannot imagine myself forgiving him. what do i do? this happened tonight and i'll be going to work off no sleep. someone please help. 

update: there's a twist to this story i haven't said yet, and it's who the female guest is. she's my 59 year old mother. 

next update: 
i sent a text saying- 

i know what you did, don't think i'm dumb. we are having a very serious conversation tonight. 

his response copied and pasted - 

ok i know your not stupid and i'm not going to play dumb l made a really bad decision by doing that there's no excuses and in no way will i be trying to defend what i did i'm going to take my repercussions whatever they may be i know you're not going to believe me but i'm sorry i guess we'll talk more about it later. 

my response - 

i don't even know if i want to talk. just leave me the fuck alone. don't talk to me or text me. 

my next update: 
i kicked him out for a couple days. he's on his way to pick up a few things. i thought i was able to really speak about what happened last night, but i can't. i have so many thoughts and words i could yell but i feel no energy or want to go there. so i lay here alone crying my eyes out. wishing for a hug or someone to help me stay strong through this process. he already has sent me money to pay for the bills that are due. he's being mature and respectful. i'm being petty and angry and i have every right to be. the caring part of me is still asking where he's going. i shouldn't care but he's been my best friend and only friend for a long time. he says he'll be staying in his car. i tell myself i don't care. does it make me a stupid person if i still do care? anyways. i'm trying to stay strong and recover while alone. thank you so much for everyone's kind words. 

my final update: i couldn't bear leaving him out somewhere on the street. i've asked him to come back. we talked it through for over an hour now and yes he does fantasize about being caught. no he is not attracted to my mother. he regrets his decision fully. we laid out all of our dirty laundry. i do not forgive him for this and am not accepting this apology right away. i don't know whether or not i should forgive him. yes my rage level was through the roof today. i was irrational in some of my responses earlier to him. i've made it clear a therapist is completely needed for us to move forward. he is sleeping on the couch for a while and i am not looking for his comfort anytime soon. thanks to all who have given me constructive criticism and really helped me get through this hard conversation and reality i had to face. this man is my best friend. he did make a mistake and he is willing to work through whatever it takes to move forward. yes i can understand we can all be a little messed up at times and make stupid decisions. he's keeping his distance from me as requested. but i don't want to deprive him of our home as well. this may take months to truly come to terms with the situation at hand. and i may take months to fully figure out what direction in life i want to take. all i can do is try to stay as positive as possible and know i'll get through this with myself day by day. with or without him is still the question.

btw i'm sorry i don't know if i'm supposed to be updating through comments or on here. i really haven't used reddit too much.  ",7

well, now i read another post on la about a guy who might have gotten married to a stranger in vegas. someone on his post added a link to the clark county marriage record search. i put her name in and holy shit if a certificate didn't pop up. she is sitting next to me ready to puke. she didn't think it was a legal marriage either.

so now what?  she didn't even really know the guy. has no idea what happened to him. she is frantically searching google and facebook for him with no luck. 

so i guess our marriage is invalid?  we have two kids!  what does this mean. were they adopted fraudulently because our marriage certificate is invalid?  i will get an attorney tomorrow but would like to know what to expect. 

1. what if we can't find this guy?
2. what if we do?
3. how much shit are we in for: filing taxes together, getting our names changed, adopting our kids under the pretense that we were married?

typically, i'm a morning person, but i couldn't sleep last night due to stress from work, etc, so i took a few unisom to help me doze off. fine, nothing out of the ordinary. i wake up this morning, feeling like the grouchiest asshole this side of the atlantic. my wife and 10yo daughter are fighting about some dumb thing or another, which is an all day/every day thing as of late. all i want to do is make a cup of tea and smoke a cigarette, but everybody seems hellbent on getting in my way and stressing me out first thing in the morning. the screaming match wakes up my 2yo son, adding to the stress. he starts crying. the water in the kettle starts boiling. i'm pissed off because not  only did i wake up to a mild approximation of the battle of normandy after getting very little actual sleep, but we're out of tea, my mug is missing, the unisom hadn't fully worn off (that stuff makes me extremely irritable), and to top it off, i can smell shit. i was ready to flip the fuck out.

i ask my wife if she'd mind cutting out the screaming match and just take our daughter to school, and pick up a box of tips on the way back, but she ignores me. my daughter bolts out the front door like a horse in a thunderstorm. my son had stopped crying, but absolutely did not want to have his diaper changed. he starts running away, laughing, having a blast. i finally catch him, but getting him to lie still was all but impossible. when i finally manage to get him onto the changing mat, he starts kicking me repeatedly in the face and chest. i lose it, hold down his little legs, undo the velcro-ish straps, and...fling the shitty diaper as hard as i could across the room. it took a moment for my sleep-deprived mind to realize what i've done, and when it finally catches up, i turn around and see an arc of shit across the ceiling  (a *popcorn* ceiling, no less), ending in a jackson pollock of shit all over the wall and my tv. to top it off, by the time i turned back around, the poopy-butt toddler is gone. i find him sitting in his brand new car seat, eating peanut butter with his bare hands.

i ended up calling out, so i could clean up the *shit* and not go to prison for murdering someone at work.

over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. so the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily ""get on my back, we'll get him together"".

"a little girl was playing in the garden. a father watched his young daughter as she played in the garden. tears formed in his eyes as he thought about her seeing the wonders of nature through such innocent eyes.

suddenly she stopped and stared at the ground. the father went over to her to see what had captured her attention.

he noticed she was looking at two spiders mating.

""daddy, what are those spiders doing?"" she asked.
""they're mating,"" her father replied.
""what do you call the spider on top?""
""that's a daddy longlegs.""

the little girl thought for a moment. ""so, the other one is a mommy longlegs?"" she asked.

the father's heart soared with the joy of such a cute and innocent question. he laughed, and then replied, ""no sweetheart. both of them are daddy longlegs.""

the little girl, looking a little puzzled, thought for a moment, then lifted her foot and stomped the spiders flat. ""well, we're not having any of that gay shit in our garden.""

"i'm 46m having a hard time accepting that my son 21m is gay. can you guys help me?. my son recently came out to my wife and i. he sat us down on our living room couch and told us he had to tell us something. he asked us if he could tell us anything? we said of course. he then asked us would we always love him? we said always, no matter what. he then told me, ""i'm gay."" that shocked me. his mother gave him a big hug and told him, ""that's okay, you're still our son and we will always love you."" i was unresponsive. i'm actually having a hard time accepting that my son is gay. it's not the kind of life i envisioned for him.

my parents always told me growing up that homosexuality is wrong, me and the guys i hung out with would make gay jokes, etc. the way i was brought up makes it hard for me to accept it. and just thinking about what gay men do behind closed doors is very disturbing to me. i don't want people to look down upon me for having a gay son. i'm sorry if i'm offending anyone, i'm just trying to be honest and express my thoughts. i still love my son, i'm just having a hard time coming to grips with his sexuality, which is why i turned to you guys. can you guys help me or give me advice with accepting my son?

edit: i just want to say that i am very overwhelmed by all of the comments. most of you guys have given me great advice. i still love my son and i always will. i agree that it's most important that he's happy. it's just that it's hard to change something that you've been hardwired into believing, but i will try my best to change my views if it means i can have a relationship with my son. i will definitely talk to my son and tell him that i love him and that i accept him. thank you all for the great advice, it's much appreciated.",7

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bef1ru/update_all_3_of_us_got_arrested_my_girlfriend_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app


hey guys.

i figured i'd give you one final update. unless you guys want another one after court. let me know.

we are all awaiting court. mine is in 2 weeks and so is my exes. my ex's boyfriends is in 3 weeks. i don't think they will last though because it's seriously looking like they're gonna do some time. my lawyer is telling me he thinks they might get years. i forgot to add that she actually got charged for fraud and identity theft as well because apparently she was trying to use my social security card for something. i'm really glad i listened to everyone and called the cops.

she keeps trying to tell me to get back together with her and that she'll break up with the other guy and that we will have the life we were supposed to have. it sounds tempting but as soon as i drop those charges i know she'd run. 

i'm not dropping anything. my son is currently at my house with me. i'm hoping to get full custody. if she somehow avoids jail it's going to be very hard. but i'm going to try. 

that's it guys. i can update after court again if you want. just let me know. i'm scared for court too because i don't want to go to jail. my ex's grandma is actually paying for all my legal fees because i told her the story and she always liked me and she felt really bad. she also gave me a very very hefty check and told me to take care of myself. my ex also gave me everything she stole from me back thinking it'd help her case. so i don't need to work for probably the next 2 years and i'm going to rent my own apartment and just pay rent for the year in advance and then quit my job for awhile and figure out what i truly want to do in my life. 

my ex is probably reading these as she keeps tabs on this reddit account. i appreciate all the advice i have been given. i still miss her. i still love her. i still feel empty. if you guys can give any advice on where to go from here i'd appreciate it.


honestly i'm a bit scared at what she may have planned next. i don't know how far she will go to win against me or whatever she's trying to do. i hope she doesn't try anything serious but until court is over and they are roaming free i do fear for my safety.

i'm probably also going to hire a financial adviser for myself. and get their input on what i should do here. honestly i may or may not quit. i might need to because of the baby. i make good money but i want to be there for my kid and i also want all my finances in order so it's best to hire someone especially with me being this young i'm nervous to have this amount of money. i don't want to lose it.",7

"update: i'm the girl who recently travelled to india and was worried about arranged marriage - i'm fine!. hi everyone,

first off, thanks so much for all of your concern. i was really struggling with this as a looming event in my future and after reading your advice i became really worried i was going to be married off during this trip to india. however i just got back, about an hour ago, and i am 100% fine, apart from a nightmare i had about arranged marriage while in india. as you can tell, i'm pretty stressed about it, whether it was going to happen this year, next year or in five years.

as i said, i got back recently and i'm doing fine, nothing was out of the ordinary, we even bought a few books as my dad promised. 

thanks again everyone! i may post again here in the future if i need any more legal help but for now this is it. i know i don't want an arranged marriage so when the time comes i am pretty sure calling shakti will be the way i'll go. thank you for giving me the confidence to make this decision.

"on the walk of shame. 
this happened last week. no throwaway because everyone already knows what happened. 

i ended up at a guys house for a casual hookup. he fell asleep and it was only like 11pm and i couldn't sleep to save my life. so, being considerate, i decided to bail so that i could go play on my phone(reddit) and not wake him up. 

i exit the house and find the gate we'd come through, only, it's closed. to make matters worse, it's one of those weird gates that doesn't have a handle, but a keyhole on both sides. 

i decide, hey, i'm an adult, i can climb this fence, no problem. it's got spikes on top, but i'm pretty positive that i can handle it. 

so, in my heels i decide to climb the fence. i get to the top and look down and realize this is easiest the highest gate/fence i've ever climbed. however, being precariously perched over the spikes, i realize it's too late to turn back now. 

so i jump down, and perfectly stick the landing. yes.

then i take a step forward and feel the arch in my left foot scream in protest. 

it's cool, i can totally walk this off.

make my way home and by the next morning, i can no longer put weight on it. fuck. 

so i head to urgent care where lo and behold they ask for my id and i realize i've left my fucking wallet at the guys house. 

i get put into a boot and told i have a sprain and possible fracture. not only this, but i had pax east (a gaming convention) the following weekend and ended up having to cancel because i couldn't walk as much as i was going to need to for all my meetings. double fuck. 

so now i'm in a boot, missing my favorite con, and still ended up having to go back to the guys house to get my wallet.

"for telling my 8 year old he can't go trick or treating with his sisters. i have 3 kids, a 10 year old daughter, a 8 year old son and an almost 7 year old daughter. my son is on the autism spectrum, but is very high functioning. lately he's been very mean, mostly to his younger sister. it's been going on for a few months, and we've talked about it with his therapist, discussed it alone with him, giving him a lot of 1 on 1 time, we've tried everything thinking maybe it's because he's jealous of no longer being the baby. this morning i heard my 7 year old crying bloody murder and when i went upstairs to her bedroom i see my son with scissors and my daughters costume that we made together as a project was all cut up to pieces. 

i comforted my daughter, made him apologize and brought him downstairs. my husband and i asked him why he would do that and he said ""it was ugly and i didn't like it."" i told him that was the meanest thing he's done, and that he's grounded and can't go trick or treating. he completely freaked out, had a tantrum, kicked and screamed and we just put a pillow under his head until he stopped and got our other kids ready for school. 

while we were getting the girls ready, i guess he called my mother and told her that we weren't letting him go trick or treating and she called me yelling about how could i do that to our child and he has autism and he didn't know what he was doing. 

my husband thinks maybe we also over reacted and we should let him earn the chance to go trick or treating but he completely destroyed his sisters costume and that's not something we can brush off. 


for not budging?


edit: my husband and i have decided he will not be trick or treating. he has shown no remorse throughout the day. we are going to discuss this with his therapist when we see her later today, but this malicious behavior is not going to be tolerated and i will not coddle my son to be a shitty person and man. thank you all for your responses.",3
"my personal tools were stolen from a company van, behind a company gate that should have been locked by a company security personnel, but wasn't. the company says i have to replace them myself, even though it was due to another employee(s)' negligence. is this right?. all of my hand tools, my tool bag, my tool belt, my socket set and drill with batteries and a charger were stolen out of my employers 5-ton truck that was on my employers property that was behind a gate that should have been locked by a security personnel, but wasn't. i rode in the truck but did not have keys for it. i was initially told by my direct superior that the tools would be replaced, but have now found out that the company we both work for will not replace them, even though the loss was because of another one (or multiple) of their employees' negligence. 

no, i do not have my own personal insurance on them. yes i am an employee, not sub contracted. the total value of my property loss was estimated at $3000. the employees are unionized but i am not yet a part of the union (i don't know if that makes a difference). i live in, and the theft was from winnipeg manitoba canada. 

more details: there were also two company vehicles stolen and a bunch of company property. i was under the impression that i would have my stuff replaced when the company stuff was missing as they were filing an insurance claim, but they have since recovered the two vehicles and now it seems like my stuff is the only stuff not recovered, and so their tune has changed, and i'm left to fend for myself.

"jesus is either the most successful cult leader or the least successful savior of humanity.. cult leader:
1. 2.2b followers
2. massive amount of money raised by his ideology
3. people give their lives to be saved by him
4. beloved and accepted by most the world and even his main rivals see value in him
5. a legacy spanning thousands of years.

least successful saviour:
1. none of his followers actually follow his advice 
2. many completely disregard his advice and think you just have to go for a dip in water and you're good.
3. nothing changed after he died holy men are still corrupt people still cling to wealth nobody helps the poor except for selfish reasons 
4. people use his teachings to justify their bad behaviour and paraphrase him to justify bigotry racism and nationalism 
5. he couldn't even save the jews from their fate at auschwitz at the hands of one of his followers 
6. many have robbed him from his true belief and used his name to promote their personal agenda 
7. many people celebrate a pagan holiday as his birthday and use his death as a reason to over indulge on chocolate 
8. his name is used to promote greed envy wrath and turn away from one of the commandments of god in the sense of modesty as the bible says the first sin was for man to become aware of our nakedness and be shamed by it and god's plan for us was to inherit the earth and multiply 

edit: just a little context, the messiah in the jewish faith is actually the one who was supposed to save the world from religious hypocrisy and ""fulfil the law"" meaning, save all humanity from original sin. according to prophets, priests and pastors, sin still exists. none of us are saved unless we're baptised. (something jesus didn't actually do until well after establishing his cult but people argue he didn't need to, because he was perfect. even though all humans at this point had the sins of their fathers, he was perfect because god was his father. though god himself never claimed to be perfect, this is an assumption.) we must go to church every sunday to eat bread as a tradition remembering him however originally this was a tradition brought over from the jewish faith, where the angel of death literally passed over egypt and liberated the jewish people from slavery by killing the first sons of egypt as a warning to their masters. it was not a weekly thing and jesus was against tradition and standardized churches. so it's kind of ironic that this has become a thing. in that regard, jesus kind of failed in his mission no matter how you look at it. he didn't clear anything up, or abolish any rules of tradition. if anything, his followers and by extension himself have only made more.

edit 2: grammar, spelling :)

disclaimer: i have received a few questions and concerns and before my inbox gets too flooded with the same ones i thought i'd make an update here. a lot of you want to know my faith, i am religious and this post was written with love. i do not believe it was jesus' fault that religion has become so corrupt i think it is the fault of all those in religious power who abuse that authority and our own fault for desiring religion to be watered down for us. while many of you are from different sects to me i am more than happy to discuss your sect with you (or your lack of one / your choice to be atheist) i might do a part two with more detail so look out for that if you're interested. also for the hitler point i hold my hands up and say it was a low blow but hitler did indeed maintain a facade of christianity while he was in power and had ties with the church. it is my belief any church leader who did not outright condemn him turned their back on jesus and their faith and while that is an easy point for me to state in these times i believe the essence of christianity to be doing the hard thing that's right, no matter what it cost you. jesus died for you, the least you could do as a christian is do the same for him. if you are an atheist i fully support your decision. in the jewish faith their are many paths to god not all of them are religious live a good life and live it well and peace will be with you. there is too much fear in this world, if you're a person of love then i love you too. 

for the christians yelling at me in the comments i made you another post going into more detail on exactly why i feel this way as a christian here you go(https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9ico0m/an_argument_against_modern_day_christianity_from/?)",6

"learn the basics of car maintenance, get involved with your car's maintenance. even if you don't physically do the work, know what it takes to go from a to b.... something i was never offered in high school and i wish i was, was a driving class that you got your hands dirty with. luckily, i have some very mechanically talented family members who i've been able to walk through issues with. i have the ability to change my brakes or change the oil. other than that, i'm not very useful with my hands, but i at least know some basics in terms of different parts on a car, what they do, how they help other parts function, etc.

if you can get with someone you trust, watch them work on a car or have them walk you through how to do it yourself. i see it more and more now. younger kids (and it's not just reserved to that age group) know absolutely dick about cars and it's not a good thing. did you invest four digits into your car? maybe you splurged and invested 5 digits. you bought a reliable honda or a subaru for $14k because you've heard good things and you want a car to last you for awhile. if you're willing to invest that kind of money into something you use every day, you need to invest the time to learn what makes the thing tick.

aside from knowing how to change a tire, you should look up resources online to see what makes the car go vroom vroom and not fek....feeeek....fekfekfek... 

knowing something simple like the difference between drum brakes and disc brakes could save you asinine amounts of money at a later date.

edit: some mechanics appear to be increasingly shady these days and they can and will take you to the woodshed if you're not careful. my dad once had an issue with his suv... the mechanic said it needed a new engine. he took it to a trusted friend and it just needed a valve adjustment. almost 7 years later and that car is still running. that's roughly $5-10k in cost compared to a $100-200 valve adjustment...

edit: not all mechanics are bad, but one bad experience can put a sour taste in your mouth.

when i was in college i got a routine oil change at a national tire and battery. dudes told me i needed to have calipers put on my rear brakes. my brakes were drum brakes. drum brakes don't have calipers. knowing this simple factoid about brakes helped me save probably $300-500 and honestly who knows what the fuck they would have done had i let them work on my brakes. 

again, if you have time time to search and purchase a multi thousand dollar car, then you have the time to do research and learn about what you're driving. do it. you may find that you're actually mechanically inclines and enjoy working on your vehicle. it could save you a few bucks or maybe even a few thousand bucks.

i can not recommend https://haynes.com/en-us/car-manuals enough. these guys write complete guidebooks and complete breakdown and repair of many models/makes of cars. you can quickly become an expert on what your car is by reading these. sure you may not be able to do the work, but you'll know what makes your car tick and it will help you be a better informed consumer, especially when trying to find good mechanics for the more complex stuff.


edit: i've changed the mechanic/trust part a bit because people didn't like the perceived generalization. i'll repeat it here: not all mechanics are shady. good mechanics are great, but if you have one bad experience it's souring and really effects someone and makes it hard for them to find one they can trust. do your research. talk to the mechanic.",10
"update: my (22m) girlfriend (20f) has been hoarding my used condoms. original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc20or/my_22m_girlfriend_20f_has_been_hoarding_my_used/)

well, i feel a lot better. definitely wasn't as big a deal as i thought it would be.

i went to v's place after class and we watched some got, and told her i had something serious to ask her. she looked scared like she thought i was going to ask to take a break, which made me feel bad but it made my actual question easier to ask. i cut straight to the chase and asked ""why is there a tupperware container filled with used condoms in your bathroom?"". she took a few seconds to process and then kinda laughed, and said ""i promise its nothing bad but it might be better if you don't know for another month or so"", which made me feel way better but i told her that i needed to at least have a vague idea of their purpose. it actually is pretty funny.

so, v is on a sports team that is kinda rowdy. and the team has a fierce rivalry with another team at a college in the same town. the other team stole something from them recently so v's team has been thinking of a way to get them back. the girls settled on the idea to hoard condoms and dump them on or in something that belongs to the other team (they aren't sure whether it will be easier to do their house, their car, their backpacks, or something else like coat pockets). so all the girls have been hoarding for like three weeks now, and they plan on striking soon. she didn't want to tell me because she didn't want me to be an accomplice. i love a good prank war though so i approve. i'm slightly worried that my dna is going to be mysteriously found at a crime scene this summer, but i honestly can't imagine things going that far.

the lesson learned is, always ask your partner before jumping to conclusions. although me posting this on reddit might save my ass if i do get framed for rape, so i don't feel too bad about my decision. also, to the person who posted that she is keeping them because she has a fetish for swallowing huge loads at a time, god bless you.

we decided to go to a romantic touristy island near canada for the weekend and do sightseeing and eat all the fudge we can before getting diabetes (some of you can probably guess where we're at by now). 

now, staying on the island itself is crazy expensive, so i found us a cute little air b&b ""tiny house"" style cabin(https://i.imgur.com/jvupf4c.jpg) to stay in instead. it's cute, has a sauna, fire pit, and a loft bed area.  

the drive up was long and uneventful. when we got to the cabin we decided to find a fun place to eat and have a few local beers before turning in. this was my first mistake. 

i ended up drinking four hard ciders of unknown alcohol content and getting a pretty good buzz. 

we decide when we get back to the cabin to just go straight to bed, so we crawl up there and pass out. i slept on the side closest to the tv, farthest from the stairs. this was my second mistake. 

at some point i have to pee. bad. so i start to get down from the loft.

and i didn't take the stairs. 

dear readers, i decided in my half asleep state to climb over the railing (by the tv) because i thought the stairs were there. i come to full consciousness when i crash to the floor hard. 

i screamed for my dear husband to save me since i didn't know the damage and still had to pee. he flew down the stairs and helped me get to the bathroom and set me up on the couch for the rest of the night because i was too scared to be up in the loft again. 

luckily i didn't break anything (on myself or the cabin) or hit my head, but my hip took the brunt of the fall and we have a full day of sightseeing today. and a seven hour car ride home tomorrow.

due to her work schedule,  she has 2 weeks off upcoming. i asked her how she planned to spend these weeks, and she revealed she will travel to her old college town about 3 hours away to meet her school friend. when i asked if i had met this friend before in the bar, she replied that this male friend is her best friend. he ""saved her life"" when she was depressed in college, and is an important person for her. sure, no problem i thought. then she revealed she always has sex with him when she visits. 

i was shocked and played it off, and only waited until one day later to talk to her about it again. she doesn't see this guy but once a year, and is adamant that there are no romantic feelings there. i get a seriously weird vibe from this: guy helped you when you tried to kill yourself, so now you owe (or give) him sex? wtf. 

she says this is something i have to accept, but i wanted to have a good think before i make any decision. i really care for her and her little doggo, but this situation makes my stomach uneasy. 

has anyone experienced this before? 

edit 1: i went to her on her lunch break, and laid out how i really feel about this. how bullshit it is that she wants to have her cake and eat it too. i'm not forcing her to cut off contact with the guy who ""saved"" her, but she cant be fooling around with him and keep me around. she was taken aback by how i came out verbally swinging. she'll gather herself and we'll talk again tonight. 

ps info: few have asked whats up with the dog: i was viciously attacked by a dog as a youth, and her dog is the only dog i ever let close to me. we all even sleep in my bed 😇 hence the attachment to him.

"update: my 36 f so 41 m of 7 years left, and i'm in a total crisis.. my post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cz6ne8/my_36_f_so_41_m_of_7_years_left_and_im_in_a_total/) didn't get a lot of attention, but i figured i'd give an update to those who read it.

i managed to get ahold of his family, as he hasn't been answering my calls or my children's calls as usual, and i was trying to get them in touch with him. and surprise... he's not back in his country. apparently he called them from rome the day before. he has been there for two weeks now, since he left. his family was also surprised to learn about the lie.

so, it's 100% clear that he has left for someone else, as he has no other reason to be in rome, and lie about going back home. of course it hurts like nothing else. but this is helping me with the self-blame and the guilt at least. i do recognize that i had become emotionally detached, due to lack of trust from past episodes, which i blamed myself for to no end after he left. but apparently i had some big ass basis for having those reservations.

i'll get a lawyer and fight for custody, and i'll try to heal from the immense pain this man has caused me and my children.

thanks for reading.

"kentucky when my daughter was 9 months old a medical student attempted to do a muscle biopsy on her. now her leg is severely disfigured.. need some advice please..

when my daughter was 9 months old, she had health problems and was in and out of the hospital for about 2-3 months. the doctors ordered a muscle biopsy on her thigh (she had had one on her heart and they thought she had mitochondrial disease) and had a medical student do it. the first time they didn't go deep enough and had to cut her open and redo the cutting of her muscle. after we done some digging and talking to her new doctors the results were inconclusive and they had no answers for us (this is 8 years later) she's now got a 4 inch scar that's deep and tight on her thigh and it bothers her terribly. it's so tight and big that it affects her walking. they sent her home on hospice with it open and not sewed shut. it looked terrible and even the doctor that seen her before she was sent home said he didn't want to send her. is there anyway we could get the hospital to pay for the damages they done and help her get some cosmetic surgery to fix her problem? sorry for the lengthy post.",2
"i 27f caught my eight year old niece trying to breastfeed her baby brother. apparently it's something she does to stop him from crying when my sister 32f leaves them by themselves. my sister has an eight year old daughter and a five month old baby. i was at my parents' house and my sister and her boyfriend came by with the kids. they stayed for a little then went somewhere but left the kids. i heard the baby crying and went to check on him and saw my niece with her shirt pulled down and holding him to her chest. i took him from her and asked her what she was doing. she said she was trying to make him happy. i told her not to do that because that's something only her mother should do. she said she does it when her mom isn't home. i asked how often does her mom leave them by themselves. she said a lot.

we confronted my sister when she came back and she got mad. she thinks an eight year old is old enough to stay home alone. she says she fixes some food and bottles before she leaves. my niece just does the breastfeed thing to comfort him because it's what she has seen my sister do. my sister doesn't think there's anything wrong with it. my parents were furious. she snapped and said if we are so concern then why don't we just take them. my mom hit back saying that we didn't birth them therefore we aren't the ones who should have to take care of them. she took the kids and left.

no contact since. we're worried about the kids. we don't want to call cps but we don't know what else we can do.",7

okay so husband and i put the son to bed and decided to take a shower together. afterwards we gave each other foot rubs (still in the nude) and our cats decided they wanted to snuggle while we were hanging out on our bed. they're both super fluffy and had cuddled up on his chest and spilled over his sides.

i thought it was super cute and snapped a picture of the 3 of them. i showed my husband and he said he thought it was cute. now here's the fuck up. i'm so focused on the giant purring cats that i don't notice my husband's huge, bushy pubes against his notably pale thighs in the corner of the picture. i sent the picture to my mil with the caption ""when dad gets home everyone wants a cuddle!"" 

i'm hoping that she doesn't notice them but i don't have that luck. here's to never being able to look her in the eyes again.

"i 34/m found condom wrappers in our trash can. my wife 34/f and i don't use them and i'm wondering how to approach this.. i'm in a bit of a difficult spot here and looking for some advice.  earlier this week i was taking the garbage out.  we have one of those large 90 gallon wheeled trash cans provided by the city and it sits outside.  i noticed that an animal had gotten into it and torn one of the bags open which happens occasionally.  i also noticed a couple of condom wrappers in there.  i had a vasectomy a few years ago and my wife and i don't use condoms.  this has led me to wonder if my wife might be cheating.  i realize this isn't damning evidence of course and there are other possible explanations.  and before now i've had no reason to suspect my wife of infidelity in the 10 years we've been married.  but i also don't want to be the naive guy who says ""oh it could never possibly happen to me"" and ignores what's staring him in the face.  i'll try to organize my thoughts a little bit below.

there's a couple parts of this that make me suspect her, at least a little.  as i said, i can't think of anyone else in our house that could have used them and thrown them away.  it's been a couple years since we last used condoms but the wrappers i found were her favorite kind when we were using them.  we have two preschoolers and our sex life (and intimacy in general) has been in a little bit of a rut lately.  not to a terrible degree or anything and likely no more than is to be expected given our situation right now.  but there have been some minor complaints from both of us about dissatisfaction with the status quo.

on the other hand, it's an outdoor trash can, so it's possible someone else could have thrown them in there.  although we've lived in this house for about 6 years and i can't remember that ever happening before.  we've been married 10 years and i've never had any reason to question her fidelity before today.  and my wife's not stupid either.  i feel like if she was going to cheat she wouldn't be dumb enough to leave evidence just lying around where i could find it like that.

i'm looking for advice on what i should do next.  do i just assume it was someone else throwing them away in there and forget about it?  do i stay quiet about it but raise my ""alert level"" so to speak and be on the lookout for other evidence?  do i actively go snooping for further evidence?  or do i confront her about it?  like i mentioned above, i don't want to be so gullible that i insist it could never happen to me, but i also don't want to damage a good relationship with false accusations or dishonest behavior.  help?

**edit to respond to some of the most common replies i'm getting:**

it's possible she's using them for sex toys, but i think it's unlikely.  we've used toys together from time to time, but it's very rare for her to use them by herself.  i know where we keep our toys and there are no condoms in there, so she'd have to be hiding them from me, which would be out of character for her.  

the wrappers were trojan fire and ice.  not normal condoms but not something super unusual either.

i'm not jumping straight to secret cameras, gps trackers, or hiring a private eye.  whether she's cheating or not those all have a high potential to end my marriage simply due to the level of distrust and paranoia involved.  if i find more evidence elsewhere i might go that far, but to me those ""confirm what i already know"" options not step one.

the trash in the torn-open bag was from our house, but due to the raccoon rooting around in there it's impossible for me to tell whether the wrappers were originally in the bag of trash or just thrown in the bin.  i didn't find any condoms.

she hasn't been secretive about her phone.  i checked phone records and there was nothing suspicious.

thanks for the advice so far.",7

"(update) boyfriend 29m keeps asking me 24f to let him do horrible things to me -- he actually did it. last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/addm05/boyfriend_29m_keeps_asking_me_24f_to_let_him_do/

after i posted, i had a lot of people tell me to leave him. i was hesitant to, but someone in a private message convinced me to at least pack an ""emergency bag"" just in case that had clothes that he wouldn't notice went missing. 

then, after 3 years of ""joking"" he actually did something. while i was brushing my hair he came up behind me and hit me hard on the butt with a coat hanger. then when i turned around, on the face. all while laughing like a lunatic. 

after that, he didn't hit me again. i snuck out that night when i didn't think he'd follow me. when he noticed i was gone he blew up my phone, trying to say he was sorry, didn't mean it, and that he needed to get help/was mentally ill. i called the police the next day. 

i wouldn't say anything much interesting has happened since. it's been about 2 weeks since then? been living in a motel for a bit now. on the 2nd i am moving in to an apartment. still kinda in shock, i think? single for the first time since i was 18 and it should probably stay that way for a good long while. my face is mostly healed now. not sure what to do with myself now.",7

added the nsfw tag just to be sure...

&#x200b;

i work at a fairly small company, full of programmers. we have the policy that, if you're tired and/or you're mentally exhausted, just do something else. in my case i usually read the news, play a quick game or read some interesting articles. now, lately i got into the whole scp universe (for those of you that don't know what that is: its basically a collection of fan fiction about a foundation that secures and contains objects and phenomenons that are unexplained and/or dangerous). the scps are ordered numerically and i'd usually just google something like 'scp 093', go to the page, read through it and go back to programming. now our boss doesn't strictly monitor what we do online but if we search for something offensive and illegal, he will get a notice and usually addresses is fairly quickly. now the fuck up: yesterday i casually searched for scp 013 and didn't type in the s, searching for 'cp 013'. the algorithm noticed that and messaged my boss. at that moment, i didn't think about it, rewrote my search, read through the article and continued programming. so later that day, my boss would come up to me and ask me to speak to me in private. i go 'sure' and wasn't sure at all what i'm in for. he starts asking me (and mind you, me and my boss have an extremely good relation) if i wanted to tell him something and if i'm aware what's legal and illegal and so on. i was so confused for like 5 minutes, feeling his worried and somewhat angry face staring at me,  until he finally asked me, why i searched for 'cp 013'. i started to laugh and explained it to him. he laughed too and we sorted it all out, but for a couple minutes i thought my heart is going to jump out of my chest. he would proceed to tell the story to everyone at my office and we all had a good laugh out of it.

"neighbor keeps flying drone above privacy fence, recording us during private moments... i'm trying to figure out what the laws are in tx for drones in neighborhoods. 

not long ago i was sick and went out into my backyard with my husband to get some fresh air. he went back inside and went to the bathroom. due to being unwell, i suddenly needed the bathroom (we have 2) and went to rush inside, but my husband had locked the door out of habit and couldn't hear me banging on the door. someone must've heard, because suddenly i heard a drone approaching. this camera-equipped drone flew over our fence and had the camera pointed at me for a good 5+ minutes while i desperately knocked on the door, doubled over, trying to get my husband's attention. it was pretty embarrassing, and i'm sure whichever neighbor owns it got a kick out of it (and who knows if they showed the video to anyone else). 

since then, there have been numerous times when my husband has gone out for an early morning cigarette while wearing nothing but his underpants, only for the drone to fly up and stay pointed at him until he comes back inside. 

i'm agoraphobic and don't leave my house unless i'm with my husband. i bought a washing line just to give myself an excuse to get outside more, because i'm otherwise cooped up inside 24hrs a day, 5+ days a week. i've now stopped going out in my own yard for more than a couple of minutes in case this drone comes to record me. we have a 6ft privacy fence just so i could feel comfortable in my backyard, but that doesn't help with a drone. 

if this drone were to get ~~""taken out""~~ knocked down by my husband while above our property, forcing the pilot to come and retrieve it, what is the liability there? i also don't know if it's worth mentioning, but we have a local air force base. we're probably ~15 miles away from it, but our house is directly below the flight path and we have military planes fly over, very closely, on a daily basis. is this drone being flown in proximity to the flight path of any significance in an aviation law aspect?


*edit: definitely didn't expect this post to get do much attention. i've woken up to dozens of messages, a lot saying the same things such as ""buy your own drone and follow it/crash it into theirs"" and ""learn how to hack and disable it"", as well as some other very illegal suggestions. i'm just going to film it next time it's filming one of us, then contact the sheriff's department.

"debt collection negotiation script. so i made this script for my wife.  she has to call and handle some debt collection from credit cards we stupidly incurred in our early 20's then defaulted on.

these are tactics that were modified from a decade of working in dealerships and watching successful car salesmen use them on customers for years.

**have a price and stick to it!!!**

they say: ""we'll settle this debt for $xxx""
you say:  ""i can't afford that right now.  how about $xx?""

they say: ""well we can offer payment plans!  how does $xx a month sound?""
you say: ""i can barely pay my bills with the money i make now.  i just received a little bit of extra money that i'm trying to pay bills with.  this has to be in one payment.""

**don't tell them anything about why you're paying debt off!!!**

they say: ""why are you trying to settle the debt?  are you trying to get a new car or a house?""
you say: ""no.  i'm simply interested in settling this debt.""

**don't be afraid to hang up!!!**

they say: ""we can't go any lower than this amount right now""
you say: ""well, unfortunately i have some other debts.  i can't afford your offer right now, so i'm going to contact them and see if they can settle for what i have.""

they'll come up with something to try to keep you on the line.  you have to stand firm that you simply can't afford their lowest offer at this time and you're going to search elsewhere.

**silence is your friend**

if you hit a lull in the negotiation (no matter what side), do not break the silence.  when this happens after an offer on either side, the first to break loses.  let them sit in the awkwardness of the silence.  if it was their offer, they'll ask if you heard them.  respond yes.  then let the silence settle again.  when they break it a second time, let them know that you can't make that payment and this may be an opportune time to say that you don't know if you can pay anything on this at this time and you're going to call some other debtors.

**all personal info hurts you/helps them**

do not reveal anything personal.  there is no situation where you will be able to use guilt, shame, or empathy on them.  they don't care.  they hear it every phone call.  nothing about your personal situation will help them, but talking about your kids and lack of (enter necessary item that requires good credit) will give them ammunition to drive their final price up.  you look desperate.  they have to be afraid that if they don't settle today, you won't ever pay them and you'll still be fine.  this is not an emotional issue.  emotions will be exploited.

by all means, feel free to add to this in any way.  i'll add/edit what i have in the original post with other good tips.  hopefully they can help people in similar situations.

edits: dealing with debt by phone call isn't always necessary.  as pointed out below by /u/thewitchof-el, you can contact them by mail and not have to deal with some of the hassle of trying to haggle.  you'll have to make your own decision on how pressing it is and whether or not you could wait a couple or several weeks to settle your debt.

from /u/remembertosmile

a few more things:

a debt settlement is different from paying a debt. look up how a ""debt settlement"" affects your credit in your state.

keep a log of your phone calls and always ask for a reference number. it makes it easy to continue the conversation if it requires multiple back and forth calls.

always get a copy of the settlement agreement in writing, before paying.

try to settle with the fees included. many collectors will charge a processing fee for paying via phone or wire.

don't be an asshole. the other person is just doing their job. keep calm and it'll make the entire process less stressful.

"i have never had a credit card because i wanted to establish healthy financial practices first. i checked my credit after filing my taxes this year and have 30k in credit card debt due to my mother opening cards in my name. what should i do?. please refer to updates.  updated situation title is no longer accurate.


it turns out i am an authorized user in regards to her bad credit.  i owe a lot less than 30k now if i am removed.

i'm sorry if this is a bit long or unclear, this is my first time posting here and i'm not sure where else to go or what to do.

i am a 22 year old national guard soldier trying to get back into the local university.  i just got back from years of training and am trying to i'm to readjust to being a civilian again.  i am working part time in addition to regular monthly drills and don't make a lot.  i also don't spend a lot and have been putting most of what i make into savings.  filing taxes was fairly easy and turbotax allowed me to check my credit score as i had filed with them.  

i haven't really tackled credit whatsoever before this as i had been an incredibly impulsive person before the military and worried that i'd go out of control with credit.  so i didn't touch it and instead developed a healthy habit of saving and budgeting before even considering getting a credit card.  i know i was stupid to not regularly check it earlier, but i thought the second best time was to do it now.

turns out my credit score is dismally low as there is more than 30,000 dollars of debt in my name which is more than triple of what i have saved up over years.  my mother has opened three accounts in my name and while she has been making the minimal payments on time, she's racked up a tremendous amount of debt.  some of the cards were opened as early as when as i was 2 years old.

i have documentation of everything that has happened, with each page of account information saved as pdfs.

i have spent the past couple of days trying to not panic, i've confronted my parents and am currently looking for cheap apartments so i don't have to live with them anymore.  however, i don't know what to do beyond that, really.  30k of debt is enormous and i don't even make that in a year.  i don't even know how to begin tackling this.  i just know that i'm heartbroken and i feel absolutely betrayed.  i never thought my own mother would steal my identity.

should i put off college and try to pay it off by working more jobs?  should i stay living with my parents to save on rent?  what should i do to tackle this debt and fix up my financial situation so i can move on with my life?  i don't want to be my parent's piggy bank anymore.

update: equifax has me quoted at 481.  when i opened creditkarma it asked about a possible home mortgage made in january 2016 that i do not see in my report.  i do not have a mortgage.  i hope this is a mistake and that there was no mortgage made in my name.  the cards that are there have me as an authorized user, thank god.  there are still 5.5k in loans, however, and the fact that my mother wants me to pay the student loan that is in her name.  her listing me as an authorized user, however, may still lose me my clearance and thus my job in the military.  i will be speaking to ncos tomorrow regarding what to do next and the status of my clearance.  in regards to the years of training (i lost track of your comment i am sorry), i had to learn a new language in addition to ait.  this took two years.

update 2:  the mortgage thing has been explained.  thank you.  i am an authorized user on the two accounts but have never been given a card nor been informed of the existence of these accounts.  i have simply been associated with her rotten credit it would seem.  i do not know why i am listed as an authorized user as i have signed nothing and have never touched credit in my life until checking my credit a few days ago.  i doubt this is reportable to the police, and will be talking to the financial and legal support provided by the military tomorrow.  thank you all for your advice!

update 3:  a lot of people questioning my military service.  understandable as my situation is strange.  i am an e4 35p who has recently got out of tradoc.  ait for 35p is one of the longest in the army, as it is language dependent and i was required to become fluent in a foreign language.  my language course at dli took a year and a half, and due to financial and familial issues stemming from what i'm detailing right now, i was recycled a few months in and had to start over.  it ended up lasting 2 years for me.  i have been with my guard unit for two monthly drills now and am still relearning how to be a civilian again.  trying to figure out my credit and how to become independent is also a part of that, and why i made this post.  thank you all again for your replies and advice.  i will do my best to read all of your comments and give updates as i deal with this issue.",10

i decided to give my ex-girlfriend that one meet up, for her sake. i honestly wasn't expecting to gain anything myself from this. but i still remembered how much i cared for her, so i figured i could do this one thing and we could both move on with our lives. meeting her in person though, that was a whole different thing. i don't know how to describe this feeling, but it was quite like anticipation, like when you're just expecting something to happen, and don't know if it's good or bad. now that i look back on it, i know i was hoping for good. 

we talked a great deal when we met and ended up staying out for hours. a great deal of it was her sincerely apologizing for not believing me and breaking up with me over the phone without even giving me a chance, but in truth, i couldn't blame her and told her as much, since these were all people she grew up with. she didn't really have a reason to not believe them, since they never did this sort of thing before. this was followed by some shit talking of her former friends, that was kind of nice and we ended up having a few laughs over it, even though i could tell she was sad by what happened. she's only got two friends now, an older woman from her workplace and a girl her age from a hobby workshop. they seem to be good for her, from what she's saying, but she admits that  occasionally she misses what she had with her previous friends, if not the people themselves. 

i really did end up feeling better from that one talk and when the time came to go our separate ways, she asked me if i would be open to talking with her more in the future. alice was upfront about her hoping that there might still be something between us in the future, but she wasn't pushy about it. anyway, told her i wouldn't know, but also told her to just talk when she feels like it and i might or might not reply. exchanged numbers and that was it for the day. 

without dragging this out any further, we started dating again. talking ended up bringing back how i used to feel about her, but i was holding back for a lot of the time and she was very patient with me. never tried to push too much, never tried to just pick up from where we ended. it's basically dating like we've never dated with each other, in some way. not sure if i can describe it properly, english isn't my first language. i guess it's got that good part of where you're getting to know someone and actually enjoying doing so. a lot of talk about trust has been had. 

just a few days back was when after a night out she invited me to her place. i knew what this was about obviously, but i wasn't 100% sure. i guess i was just being cautious on some level. alice seemed to sense it and let me off with some words of how i might need some rest for work in the morning, so she'd understand. i can't really tell you how that made me feel exactly, but it - it just shows me she cared. she cares and i went up with her and it was something i really fucking missed. it's not just two people together. it's her and me together. so yeah, we're together, we're dating and we're taking it a bit slowly, but i'm happy and she's happy and things aregood.

i am in california. i need help and i'm hoping that some of you may have some insight. 
my autistic  6 year old has been with the same aba (behavioral therapy) company for 4 years and we love them. several weeks ago, we got a new behavioral therapist who is with my son 4 days a week, 2 of them at our home. i have not been happy with her as she rubbed me the wrong way from the start: harsher that necessary with my son and overall cold and calloused. i spoke to our bcba (supervisor) and she said the therapist was brand new to the company and that they'd give her further training. 

today, i get a phone call from our bcba who tells me that cps was called over a concern that there was a bottle of supplements (turmeric, to be specific) on the counter that my son allegedly picked up and it concerned her. the therapist never said anything to me about this.  our bcba then says that she herself has been to our home many times and is here to back me up in anyway needed and that she has never been concerned about anything in our home.

1. should i obtain legal council or just move forward and willingly work with cps knowing that there is no case?  my thought is that this is something frivolous and clearly not neglect, but i honestly have no idea what to expect with this process and want to do what's best for my family. 

2. if i do decide to move forward sans attorney, do i allow them in when they visit? 

3. how much (or little) information do i give during the home visit? 

any feedback would be much appreciated. this is brand new territory for me and, quite frankly, i'm terrified even though i know that i'm a damn good special needs mother.

"i (33f) found out that my husband (34m) has a mistress (20f) and i honestly don't mind which has me questioning my sanity.. he doesn't know that i know and i'm not sure whether i should confront him or just look the other way. i'm not angry or hurt or upset. maybe a tad jealous but otherwise i'm honestly not bothered by it. 

it is understandable given our dead bedroom situation. we have only had sex a handful of times in the past year. he has always had a high sex drive and i'm just not in the mood for it most of the time.  the  birth of our second child caused significant tearing resulting in painful sex. i've also gained around 50 lbs from hypothyroidism and the pregnancies. my husband's a very good looking guy and works out at the gym most days a week. 

i'm probably more relieved than anything else. at least he is getting his sexual needs met. we've been married for ten years and have two kids under 5 and overall we have a good marriage other than the sex so i'm 99.99% confident that he isn't going to run off with her. even if he is spending a little money on her, it's really not my business as long as he provides for us, which he does very well

i'm surprised by my reaction as well. am i normal?",7

"update delinquent child support case. the tl;dr is my father is a truck driver, moved around a lot, and switched jobs whenever child support caught up with him. he saw my brother and i about two days a year, much less than the two days per week the child support was based on. he ended up owing $90,000 + interest for delinquent payments, which ended up at around $450,000. he was set to inherit a lot of money from my grandmother, paid $2,000 monthly so he wouldn't blow it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/84i2i4/ca_delinquent_child_support_case/

------------------------------------------

court dropped the initial amount owed due to a court filing error during the divorce, which made my parents legally married for about a year and a half after they had submitted divorce paperwork (ca courts say 'oops!') final agreed upon amount was ~$390,000. my father disputed this amount, but never submitted any evidence (because there was none) so that amount was final.

2nd court case today for the inheritance money, where my mother was made a plaintiff. father tried to claim he worked for my grandfather, and my grandfather paid the child support for him (neither of those are true) but i guess he forgot (lol) to mention that during the child support case, and the judge didn't want to hear it. also claimed he has a great relationship with both of his sons (i stopped talking to him when i was 13, which is more than half my life ago, and my brother doesn't really know him so well since he was gone basically my brother's entire life.)

judge ruled totally in favor of my mother, so the $190,000 my father was set to inherit is being given directly to my mother. judge also ruled my father has to continue paying $700 a month, which is what the previous child support hearing had determined due to the $2,000 monthly payments he was originally supposed to receive in inheritance money. 

the best part is my father tried to settle out of court for $25,000.

---------------------------------------------------

my mother is elated. my father has been mocking her for years over this, telling her she would never get her money. my mother never spent any money on herself, and instead tried to make sure my brother and i didn't miss out on anything because we had just one parent around. she has almost nothing for retirement now, since she had to take out of her 401k a lot and since she got laid off 6 months before she was eligible for retirement.

this is pretty much the best thing that has happened to my family in quite some time. i don't live by my mom, but will be sending my brother some money to buy a nice bottle of champagne.

"for leaving my car profanely vandalized?. a month ago, i parked in a spot on a public road (the street i live on) that someone had tried to save for themselves using a folding chair. i usually won't do that but it was the only spot left. anyway the next monday i went to take my car to work and someone had spray painted bitch across the whole side of my car. 

i went to the cops and it wasn't too hard to figure out what dumbass did it, a few neighbors knew who always put the chair out to save the spot, and figured it was them. a neighbors doorbell camera feed proved it. i got a $1200 settlement for the damages, and decided not to use it to fix my car because my car's a $2500 junker that i'm planning on replacing within the year anyway.

i instead got my boyfriend who's office has a vinyl sticker printer to print me a big red sticker saying bad, and another that's a ""censoring"" exclamation point and i put it on my car so it reads bad b!tch now. 

my friends and coworkers think it's funny, i work in a trade where much cruder stuff gets tossed around every day so it's nbd driving it to work. if anything i've gotten more respect for driving my ""bad bitchmobile"" around

i'm in grad school. i was at the school bookstore today and i saw a t-shirt that said ""university"" with the mascot on it. next to it was an identical t shirt that said ""university dad."" i bought the plain one in my size and the dad one in my stepdad's size. 

i have previously told him that i won't be able to visit him and my mom this summer because of school stuff. the plan is that on father's day i'm going to drive there as a surprise. i'm going to be wearing my t shirt. some back story: i've been talking for a few months about getting university apparel, but, you know, grad school stipend. licensed apparel is absurdly overpriced. so, anyway, i'll be wearing my shirt when i drive up. i'm going to ask him if he likes my new shirt. when he (hopefully) says yes, i'm going to pull out his shirt and say, ""good, because i got you one to match!""

"by ejaculating a huge load of blood directly into my wife's mouth. this literally happened tonight. 

&#x200b;

so, last monday, i got a vasectomy (my wife and i came to the conclusion that there are already more than enough people in the world). per doctor's orders, i wasn't able to ejaculate for the first week. 

  
fast forward to today, and it's been six full days. i'm now hornier than an incel walking past a victoria's secret . the wife and i decide to give it a try in the bedroom. after an attempt at traditional intercourse proves to be short lived because my nether buddies are still too sore, my wife comes up clutch. i take a quick shower and we quickly go at it again. this time, she goes down on me. normally, i have a hard time cumming from just a blow job, but i was so pent up that i erupt after about 2 minutes. my wife, being the superstar that she is, initially takes it like a champ. then, after time seems to stand still for a moment, she spews out huge glob after huge glob of a blood red semen concoction onto my stomach. i look at it in abject horror for a second, and then say aloud, ""oh yeah, i read that could happen"". wife is briefly exasperated, ""you couldn't have remembered that a minute ago"", but ends up taking the whole thing magnanimously.

&#x200b;

fortunately, this fuck up didn't have any serious consequences, other than the emotional trauma associated with seeing your wife spit out your bloody semen.

tldr - had a vascectomy last week, got a bj from the wife today, and shot a bloody mess into her mouth tonight.

"for telling a regular customer that he isn't as beloved as he thinks and banning him?. i manage a small cafe in a college town. we are one of the places who doesn't have wifi because we only have 6 indoor tables and wifi encourages people 'camping' tables all day, which is bad for business (we aren't one of those ""no wifi, just talk to each other!!!"" places, it's just better for turnover this way. edit to add: we don't ask patrons who spend a long time there to leave or try to rush them in any way).

we have one regular who i'll call sam who comes in every day, without fail, and camps out for 4-6 hours. sam is about 35 and i believe is a grad student or was one at the nearby university. he clearly thinks he is a beloved regular and talks to the staff/hangs out near the counter every moment he thinks we aren't busy and basically drives us crazy. this has been going on for almost a year but was especially bad all summer when our front of house staff was all female (just a coincidence based on who quit for the summer). he doesn't exactly flirt with us but he pesters us with personal questions and boring stories in a way he doesn't pester male staff.

during his 4-6 hour stay, he uses a wifi... dongle thing he brings from home, laughs outloud at things he's reading online (and then comes up to the counter to tell us), tries to police other customers' behavior around tables/chairs/cream and sugar/trash, and just stares at us waiting to pounce when we don't have a customer at the counter. during all this, he buys one small cappuccino, no tip, and sometimes paws through our day-old stuff and tries to get us to toast/heat it 'for him' even though it's against the rules.

after months of me politely but firmly trying to correct his behavior, he tried to police a group who pushed two tables together saying 'that isn't how we do it here' (this isn't even a rule here!) and i snapped. i pulled him aside, told him he's been driving us crazy for a year, that me asking him to leave us alone while we work has fallen on deaf ears, and he's banned. he had a fit of course but he did finally leave and hasn't been back.

the staff and actual beloved regulars are split. some feel bad for him because they think he's just a lonely dork and he didn't really break any hard and fast rule. my two favorite regulars and all of the female front of house staff are happy but the male staff members and other manager (who doesn't work during sam's 'visiting hours') think i was too harsh. our other banned customers are banned for like, putting poop on the bathroom walls or stealing, so being annoying isn't a capital offense, but i really believe his annoyingness was bad for business and staff morale.",3

"my sister falsely reported myself and my daughter missing and it created a media stir up and a lot of visits from detectives and cbs workers in the domestic violence shelter i was staying in to keep safe from her. (mo). after leaving my abusive ex boyfriend with my infant daughter, i went to stay with my mother and sister to recover from the horrific emotional and physical trauma we survived for nearly five years. i thought it would be healthy and helpful for us to be around some family who cared and wanted to see us heal from his abuse. 

keep in mind i had not resided with my mom or sister for over a decade. i'd only made breif visits to my hometown every once and a while. this was fully moved in and no going back. 

i started becoming uncomfortable with some of the behaviors and especially with the way my sister was hitting her daughter with a belt to discipline her. i could not let my daughter see that for fear it could harm her in some way. my mom and sister are very enmeshed both have never lived alone once and are very codependent with one another. there was a lot of drama and zero respect for boundaries, my belongings were being stolen by the kids and were even told by their parents to take money from my purse at one point. i decided it was time to leave as soon as possible. 

after i left i started noticing that my phone was acting strangly. my data kept going over and the battery was always almost too hot to touch. i ended up taking it into an apple store and one of the techs said there had been spyware installed and a keylogger. he also said that it can't be done remotely so to think of who knows my password. my sister and her kids are the only people. 

the next day i was followed for three hours and at one point i had to flag down the police so that i could tell them what was going on and they helped me get into a domestic violence shelter. at this time i was still talking with my sister as she was pretending to be a sympathetic ear to get info. i told her the name of the town the shelter was in and it wasn't soon after that i told her about the spyware that had been found on my phone. her reaction was strange (calling me paranoid and delusional) so strange that i got rid of my phone as fast as possible and had a police escort to the shelter that evening. 

not soon after that i found out she had filed a missing persons report and tried to have an amber alert issued for my daughter. she had over 12 jurisdictions working to find me because of the lies she had told them. it was everywhere and i couldn't go to the store without someone calling 911. it got to social media and eventually one of the residents inside the shelter started communicating with my sister. i'm not sure what was said but the director was able to see the computer activity. 

the next day cps came to the shelter door. i don't know how they knew for sure that i was ther, but i'll make an educated guess it was because of the correspondence between the shelter resident and my sister. my sister is an lpn and she tried to use her mandated reporter status to make it more convincing. she was also accessing our medical records to get our location. 

i met with the detective from cps that same day and it was flagged as unfounded and closed. she said that they see this situation all of the time and that it's usually the person calling who should be investigated. 

now any time anyone googles my name or my daughters this whole thing comes up and it paints me as this unhinged, mentally unstable and unfit mother all because of what my sister fabricated. i'll never find a job in my state and i'm considering moving away. 

this has to be illegal or at least something could be done through a civil lawsuit? 

what can i do?
.
edit: cps not cbs i'm title.

also, i still don't understand why she is doing this to my daughter and i. i can't think of any reason other than pure enjoyment and possibly some type of personality disorder.

i also forgot to add that she had taken pictures of my car and license tag weeks before this all unfolded. a detective was able to see when and where each photo was taken. ",2
"if your girlfriend is bi, being intimate with other girls should be considered cheating. saw a thread where the op was getting territorial over his bi girlfriend cuddling and sleeping over with other girls. all the comments basically said ""get over it""

i said ""it should be considered equivalent to her cuddling and sleeping over with a guy, because she's attracted to both genders. talk with her and if she continues break things off""

blasted with downvotes, called a bigot and biphobic. 

i mentioned a situation where i was in a relationship with a bi girl and she made out with other girls when we were together. when i had a problem with it, she replaced me with another guy who'd be okay with watching her playing tonsil hockey with other girls. 

replies just said things like ""good, i hope you go through situatuons like that for the rest of your life""

so... cheating is only okay if it's girl-on-girl? what kind of logic is this? if im straight, date someone that's bi, i'm supposed to let her make out with other girls? if i'm bi, does that mean i get a free pass to make out with other dudes, and if my gf gets mad she gets called a bigot?

edit: some comments have me confused. being bi is perfectly fine. having a relationship being bi is fine. i know a lot of bi people who don't cheat, and are happy. as long as you set your own boundaries that both of you consent to, even if you two agree you can make out with others.

all this post is about is the morons on reddit who think girl-on-girl or boy-on-boy actions are exclusively not cheating. its not a dig at any bi relationships, its a dig at the ""if shes/hes doing it with a girl/boy its not cheating"" mindset. again, if you guys agreed that's acceptable behavior thats okay. as long as there's mutual consent to being polyamorous.",6

edit 2: i have had some requests for an update. there isn't much more to report. i am still away from the house, and we still have not spoken. although i hear she still insists nothing happened. i still don't believe her. i spoke to her son last night, he was distraught. i spoke to him today and he is doing better. i also text his dad to let him know, he sent a nice response back thanking me for being in the kids life, and for everything i have done for him. tomorrow, i start the solicitor hunt. more updates to follow...

apologies, this is a long one. tl;dr at the end. also sorry for formatting, on mobile. 

bit of background. my wife was going on a night out with one of her girl friends. her friend picked her up and they went into town. wife forgot her key, i needed to keep the back door unlocked. 

it gets to 1 am, i send her a text saying dont be too late due to the door being open. no response. 2.30am still not home. at this point i start calling but there is no answer. fast forward to 8am, 70ish calls later and still no sign of her. i was very worried at this point. 

backtrack a little, to around 1am when i notice on her laptop (which she left on, but on the lockscreen) a notification of a facebook message, from a random guy telling her what bar she was in but then no further messages.

so then this morning she finally texts me to say she is at her friends. i then check the laptop again and see an exchange of messages between her and said friend (i can't see what wife is saying, just friends responses).

the friend was asking if she was home yet, and when she would go home. she then asked wife ""what is your story? i will make sure i stick to it"". they then plan the story about why she had to take a taxi home, and friend was saying ""don't worry for all he knows you are here asleep in my spare room"". after a few further messages the best message of the lot was sent.

""so, how big was his dick then?"" i photographed all the messages. 

later when wife returns home at first i play it cool like i dont know what went on. she is walking around the house acting perfect, like nothing was wrong. eventually i confront her, and show the messages. at first she swore blind she was at the friends house, and that i could call her to check that (of course i could, they had already got their stories straight). when i showed her the last message she eventually admitted she was at this guy's house, slept in his bed but nothing happened. i calmly left the house with her yelling at me to leave.

12 hours later, i am now not speaking with her or responding to messages. she started saying she did nothing wrong and that i was the one throwing it all away. apparently me leaving was proof i never loved her. 

now we are at the borderline emotional blackmail stage. claiming she is heartbroken along with her son (not mine,  he is from a previous relationship). i feel she is trying to make me feel bad about leaving, like i should go running back to her. she broke my trust, and for me that's the end. she still swears nothing happened between them, i dont have solid evidence they did sleep together, but i feel the evidence strongly points towards that. she wants to talk like adults and sort things out. in all honesty i don't even think this is the first time she has done this now i know she is capable of it. 

how do i get past this? currently i have zero intention of going back to her. i dont know what to do with myself. any advice on how to handle this?

most people would agree that the idea of speaking in front of large groups of people can be terrifying, and so we tend to avoid it whenever possible. there are times, however, when we are faced with the task and there's no running away: we must say a few words. the following is a template for success which you can use when it's your turn to speak, in just about any type of gathering, formal or informal. 


**1. the greeting**

*""good...""*

the greeting is the easy part. you begin by simply wishing your audience a good morning, afternoon, evening, or whatever time of day it is. ***good** evening everybody...*

**2. state the event**

*""as we all know...""*

the second part is also very easy: you simply state the obvious and remind everybody what the purpose of the event or celebration is, and what you're all doing there. ***as we all know,** we're here to celebrate the marriage of john and kate, and to show them our support as they begin their journey of love and life together...* now you've got the ball rolling, and the words are coming out easily. you look like you know what you're doing up there, and people are listening. so now, it's time to....

**3. establish common ground**

*""we've all...""*

it's important to include your audience as part of the message you're delivering. talk about something both yourself and your audience can relate to regarding the event or celebration. ***we've all** had the wonderful opportunity to get to know john and kate and enjoy watching their love develop...*

**4. state why you're speaking**

*""i...""*

include a personal account, or tell a brief story to let people know why you specifically are talking. what gives you the right to be speaking..? ***i've** personally been very lucky to have john as a close friend of mine, and it's been quite amazing to watch how he's grown as a person, and couldn't be more pleased for him to have found someone like kate to go about his life with...* 

**5. call for action**

*""so let's all...""*

finally, close your speech with a call for action. this lets everybody know that you're finished without you having to awkwardly say ""that's it!"" or ""i'm finished, thank you""...that is how every weak speech is concluded and makes the audience uncomfortable. you should say something like ***""so let's all** raise a glass to john and kate, and wish them well. cheers!"" or, **so let's all** give a big round of applause to mark for the outstanding job he's done while working with the company""* 


obviously, there are many different ways these leading lines can be used, but if you can commit them to memory and be prepared to use them next time you might be asked to speak, you will let go of all fear and anxiety, and people will be so impressed with your ability to get up and give a confident, fluent speech in front of a group of people, while looking like you didn't even have to prepare! good luck, and happy public speaking!",8

there was a family that came in last week from out of town with a special needs child. he was being very loud the whole time and screaming. i politely asked the family if they could calm him, as we were filled to capacity and the screaming was disturbing half the guests in our restaurant. 

he calmed down, then about 5 minutes later he started back again except this time he was cursing and screaming racial slurs at an african american family sitting behind them. this is where i drew the line. the mother was distraught about it and apologized refusely, but i couldn't let them stay. i asked them to leave, though i did give them 50% off their meal (i don't feel like i should have.)

i let the african american family eat for free and gave them a voucher for a free order of hot wings, which they said they would use soon. 

my thought process is, they were using slander and racist slurs against a large percentage of our clientele. i couldn't have that. 

am i the asshole? my family tells me that i singled them out and embarrassed them in front of everyone, but if this was a national chain they were in doing this then they would have been kicked out immediately with no exceptions. ",3

"my (38f) brother (36m) stole $50,000 from me. should i take him to court or walk away and never talk to him again?. long story short. 7 years ago we bought an investment property together. we agreed he could live there rent free while he fixed it up and got settled in life. i ended up paying taxes and insurance every year and he's pretty much destroyed the house. it honestly looks like a crack house. i had an appraisal done last week and the home has lost half its value due to damages and lack of upkeep. i didn't realize it was that bad and had sent money over the years to make repairs, which he never did and pocketed the money. in addition, i gave him a personal loan of $5000, which he has never paid back.

my brother is an alcoholic and has a job, but it's barely minimum wage. the house is in my name, so i could start the eviction process, but i'm pretty sure he would be homeless then. i don't see how i could ever get my money back unless i sold the house, but is it worth the hassle? should i just accept i made a mistake trusting him and walk away from the relationship?

he denies responsibility, feels like he's done nothing wrong, says he's struggling, that he'll pay me back, do better, etc etc

also, my brother received $30,000 last year from an inheritance and didn't pay me back or make needed repairs on the house he said he would.

tl;dr*  should i take my brother to court to kick him out of a house we co-own that he has destroyed or just walk away and take the financial loss?

update: i'm selling the house to an investor. thank you everyone for your comments and support. it gave me the courage to take action! i'm on the fence about giving him cash to move out and then a portion of the profit. any thoughts?",7
"if you get mail delivered that's already been opened, report it to the postal inspector. there's lots of holiday cards being sent through the mail this time of year. they are easy to spot since they're usually a very distinct shape and size. many times these cards will have checks or cash in them, making them really easy targets for mail theft. 

it's clearly easy to track who cashed a stolen check, but not so much with cash. 

if your mail is arriving opened and things are missing, report it. there is a special postal inspection service specifically for this type of thing. you can report online or over the phone. 

here is the link to their site. (https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/)  i called them today to report this exact issue and was routed to a real, live person very quickly and they were courteous and very helpful. took all pertinent information and confirmed it and let me know i would be contacted in the next 2-3 business days.  it was all very efficient and easy. 

suggest to family members and people that might send cash in a card to, instead, send a check (since they're easier to track, can do stop payments if necessary). if they must send cash, have them send in a standard sized security envelope (the kind that have some type of pattern on the inside to make them less transparent), or in a standard sized not security envelope, but wrapped in a piece of lined paper or two so it isn't readily apparent what's inside. 


**edit:** wow, this got popular! 
 
* because there may be some confusion, reporting to your post office, is not the same as reporting to the postal inspector.

* i posted this because i have recently had my mail arrive deliberately opened.  and i mean, the envelope was sealed with packing tape that had been sliced through, presumably with a knife-like object.  

* i am in the us, but from the comments, it looks like the uk has something similar for their mail.  a quick google search looked to have some good resources.

* there's a lot of folks saying nothing will happen, and that may be the case, but from reading the web site, it looks like they determine whether to investigate based on trends and number of reports.  if several people in a neighborhood are being affected, maybe try getting everyone to call in and report the issue so the inspectors don't write it off to ""the mail machine probably tore up the envelope.""

* if you can tell me how to get rid of the picture, i would be happy to.  when i added the link to the inspector's site, i guess reddit decided to pick a picture of one of their most wanted.

"update - for not telling my boyfriend about my ""troubled"" past.  in my previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bek79b/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_about_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), i (27m) asked you if i was an asshole for not telling my boyfriend of 10 months that i did drugs from the age of 14 to 25. most of the answers were that i was being an asshole and that i needed to tell him about my past if i wanted our relationship to go anywhere. some of you suggested talking to my therapist and my friend (who called me an asshole in the first place) about it, and to write down everything in a letter and give it to him.

so i took a week to write and rewrite and rewrite the letter again, and i brought it with me to two sessions with my therapist. she gave me some more advice (btw she didn't know i was seeing someone that seriously, otherwise she would have advised me to tell him sooner), i rewrote the letter another couple of times, and i decided saturday would be the day to do it. i also decided to actually read the letter out loud to him, instead of having him read it.

on saturday i almost changed my mind, but when he came over, he could immediately tell something was the matter because i was jittery as hell, so i did it anyway.

i won't go into extreme detail here, but the jist of the letter was that i used to do drugs for ages, i relapsed and overdosed several times, my mental health issues that i was seeing a therapist for are not my actual diagnosis but symptoms of ptsd, i told him what caused the ptsd and how it led to me turning to drugs, and finally that i want him to know exactly who i am before committing to me, and that i understand if it's too much to handle.

he started crying and said he was sorry for the things that happened to me and that i did to myself, and that he was happy i trusted and loved him enough to share all of it with him. he said he does want to stay with me because the person he's known for 10 months has never made him feel anything but happy and loved, and that he's prepared to take a chance on me. (he said a bunch of other things that i can't even remember because i was so distressed and we were both crying a lot, but it was all positive.)

and that's it, we're still a couple, i don't have any dark secrets anymore and i'm looking forward to being in a loving and honest relationship with an amazing guy. i truly feel like i'm luckier than i deserve to be and i'll do my best to make it worthwhile to him. i'm still a bit shakey because it could have easily turned out much different, plus i've always had low self-esteem, but i'll try not to get in my head about it.

thank you all for telling me to get a fucking grip and deal with this before it was too late, you're nicer than people give you credit. and especially thank you to everyone who said they were proud of me for being sober and to keep it going - you have no idea how much that means to me!",3
"why does talking on the phone become difficult if you hear the feedback of your own voice due to connection issues?. i work in it, and i spend a lot of time on the phone.  every once in a while, people will have phone issues and as i talk to them, even though they can hear me and i can hear them, i will hear the almost immediate feedback of my voice saying everything i just said.  at least for me, it makes it very confusing and difficult for me to keep the conversation going coherently because i have to really think about what i'm saying and there tends to be a lot of pauses as i speak.  is this a common phenomenon, and why does it happen?",9
"the ""believe the victim always"" idea scares me.. please read. 

i am in no way saying victims of sexual harassment/racism/sexism should not speak up. they should feel like their accusations are being treated fairly and should not be reprimanded for coming forward. every accusation should be investigated. 

most accusations are true. however, i as a public school teacher am terrified of what a blanket siding with the victim could mean for my profession. i am fairly new to teaching and want to never do anything else with my working life. i am only in my 5th year and have already heard horror stories of teachers being wrongly accused of inappropriate relationships with students that were deemed in a court of law to be not guilty. the problem is, their verdict is never as well publicized as their accusation. these teachers can almost never teach again, and some can't get jobs even outside of teaching. 

in my 5 years, i have been accused of racism by an upset student. luckily, other teachers were in the room and we resolved it immediately, but how hard wouldn't be with today's technology to fake a text conversation or email between a student and me and share it with a news media or get it trending? i already have lawsuit happy parents who are so past any semblance of morality that this seems reasonably plausible that this could happen once considering i have 30 years left and about 100 new students a year.  

i am not a core subject teacher. i teach a subject where i can teach a student from 6th grade to 12th grade, and we spend a lot of time practicing after school, sometimes in small groups. i was essentially taught in college to be paranoid of being alone with a student for any length of time, especially in your first 10 years of teaching, because all it takes is an accusation. 

i am not running for a lifetime position on the highest judiciary body in the united states. i am a school teacher. a mere accusation should not destroy a public school teacher's career. ",6

"beware of ""just launched"" 3rd party seller bots on amazon.com.. for example: https://imgur.com/a/ut4bi

**edit:** just to be clear, the fake sellers (bots) in that image are sarah bandler and richard reesh. and now kimberly giillio(https://smile.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/b01g3jyvym/ref=wl_it_of_o_pd_ns_lnk?ie=utf8&colid=1uupif3pusj8q&coliid=i3725kl8v4vwp1).

these bots severely undercut the market rate for the product in hopes of luring in consumers. after the consumer's purchase, they send a fake tracking code and collect their money while you're out of your money and the product. i'm not sure what amazon usually does once alerted to this scam post-purchase, but users on /r/amazon report mixed responses, where they're sometimes helped and sometimes not (see thread below). the bots propagate almost immediately after they're reported to customer service (i did so for the example above and another bot popped up immediately thereafter). users on /r/amazon report these bots are from china. 

the safest bet to ordering products on amazon is to buy from amazon itself, verified sellers, or sellers with multiple ratings. just beware of these scams.

"the ""lorena"" documentary is disturbing because it paints a woman who cut off a man's penis as a victim whose action was understandable. and if she truly was abused and mistreated by her husband, which it really looks like she was, of course she had every right to defend herself. she should have filed a case against him. he should have been charged. the two would have separated ways and that would have been the end of it.

hell if he really sexually assaulted her, i would have even understood it even if she had killed him in self defence. but to take away someone's genitals is just beyond horrific torture. i don't think that should have done that. in fact she went to his room when he was asleep and cut it off. and went out of her way to throw it into a field so it could not be recovered and re-attached. it was only later, after an extensive search, that they found what was left of the severed penis in a field and put it back. 

in various articles written about the new documentary now(https://www.salon.com/2019/02/15/lorena-confronts-the-truth-about-the-bobbitts-and-how-america-failed-her/), lorena is painted as the innocent victim. never mind the fact that, regardless of what happened to her, she castrated a man and got away with it. she was never punished, only by public perception. she never served jail time even though her husband was not found guilty on any of the charges she put forward. she was set free ""by reasons of insanity"". wtf?!

the whole case was disturbing but ultimately making a documentary that is very one-sided about how sad lorena bobbitt is and pretty much brushing aside the fact that she castrated a man as 'understandable given the circumstances' is incredibly messed up to me.

**tl;dr:** i sympathise, as one woman to another, with what lorena went through but it should not be an excuse to torture someone and take away their genitals and not face serious jail time for it. ",6

"update - i need to tell my wife that i know she has been cheating on me and that i want a divorce but she has severe anxiety and panic attacks.. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/90pam5/40m\_i\_need\_to\_tell\_my\_wife\_that\_i\_know\_she\_has/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/90pam5/40m_i_need_to_tell_my_wife_that_i_know_she_has/)

i decided to wait a bit to tell her in order to carefully think about what to say and when to say it. this was a good decision on my part as it gave me time for the anger to fade and logic to begin. when i told her she was in shock, apologised for everything, and cried...no panic attacks. i was surprised that she thought she would never get caught. she thought it was just a phase. she never wanted to split up. she was very upset about not seeing my family again, going on family vacations, and her fear of being an old ugly lady with no one to love her. i had to push myself to not feel bad for her. i am not ready to forgive her.  thank goodness this is a problem that was not my fault. it feels good to know that. 

she does not like the idea of a divorce, but understands that is the consequence of her mistake. we talked for the next few days on how to divide up everything, made a timeline for separation, and talked about how to divide the time exactly 50% with our child. we were both very professional and realistic. we have been best friends for the last 10+ years and done a good job of working together, so this was not surprise. our main problem was the bedroom and romance aspect.

i am glad i ignored the people on her that wanted me to act all ""fire and brimstone"" on her, kick her out, get lawyers, etc...  there were a few calm, realistic and logical people that helped me. thanks! eventually we will need lawyers, but my hope is that everything is taken care of by us first. 

from here the hardest part if for me is that i want to forget the affair occurred and keep things the same and easy. i keep reminding myself of the future pain and suffering if we do not separate. i will never trust her again. i am certain she will cheat again. my son will be better off with divorced parents that are happy than miserable cheating parents.  i hope this is true. the alternative is to stay in a marriage that is simply two parents living in the same house with no expectation to help each other out physically or emotionally, but we both see our son everyday.",7

"for telling my girlfriend that her six y/o stinks and needs to be taught proper hygiene?. first time poster here and i'm on mobile so i hope this goes well. anyways, let's jump right in to the stank!

me (24m) and my girlfriend (24f) had a baby boy one month ago today, and things have been pretty awesome. we've really come together as a couple and our communication has been healthier than ever; even our levels of trust and little displays of affection are through the roof. all in all, a potentially stressful and chaotic situation worked out pretty well! 

my so has a six year old boy from a high school fling. the father moved several states away when he found out about the kid, and has only been around two or three times, for no more than an hour each time. her son knows i am not his father but for the last three years i have tried to reinforce the fact that i am his friend and he can always talk to me. we play basketball together and we go bowling every weekend, as long as he behaves in school that week, so i would think to think that we are pretty close. 

so two days ago (friday) after work, the three of us went bowling while my mother watched our newborn. as we're changing shoes, i notice a really gnarly odor akin to sour milk and garlic. i searched for the offensive smell and i realized it was my gf's son's feet. when i leaned down to put all of our shoes underneath the table, i was about a foot away from him and couldn't help but notice he absolutely reeked. i was a little boy once, so i shrugged it off and made a mental note to tell his mom later. 

as luck would have it, she brought up to me a few minutes later how he got made fun of at school that day for smelling bad and how it hurt his feelings. me being the idiot that i am immediately responded with, ""so, it smells like he hasn't wiped his ass properly in days. does he use soap in the shower? did you ever show him how?"" to which she blushed and vehemently responded that it was not appropriate for her to bathe with her own son. 

now that he's six, i kind of agree, but i wasn't born knowing how to properly clean my body, i had to be taught. i told her that i felt as if it was her job as the sole parent to teach her son hygiene, otherwise this problem will never go away. i also stated that with our son, the newborn, i would 100% be taking responsibility for his hygiene so that i knew it would get done. she started to tear up and got really angry with me, so we finished our first game of bowling and left. she's been pissed at me all weekend. here? should i have handled that better? different?",3

"by sitting on my right testicle and blacking out because of the pain.. tl:dr ls is the title.


it was a average summer vacation day, i woke up late ate breakfast, blah blah blah, then i made a nutella milkshake (which is actually really tasty) and went to sit down on the living room chair. that's when disaster struck. i don't really know how and why, probably the angle i was about to sit on, but i sat on my right testicle. the pain was insane. i jumped off the chair and started walking out, in pain. suddenly i had black spot clouding my eyes and the next thing i know, i'm on the floor with my milkshake over me and my mom screaming. i blacked out for a few seconds and honestly it was the scariest few seconds of my life. i had a pounding headache but at least my right testicle didn't hurt anymore! i'm fine now, and my mother calmed down before calling the ambulance. that was the first time i ever blacked out and i honestly was really scared.




edit: a lot of people are asking for the nutella milkshake so:
you must heat your nutella just enough so it becomes more of a liquid. then you ad it to warm milk and shake (or use a blender) you can add chocolate ice cream for more flavor btw!


edit2: everyone worrying about my testicle, please don't. i didn't sit on it that bad and i don't think i fainted just from the pain from that, i don't drink water a lot so it was probably also from dehydration. if there as something wrong it wouldn't stop hurting 40 seconds later.

"update woman has come forward claiming she had a child with my late father to try and obtain a cut of his estate. edit: opps, forgot original post. my bad(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ed18t/ny_woman_has_come_forward_claiming_her_child_is/)

seeing as the last post i made got popular thought i would come back and give an update. as much as i wish this ended dramatically with sd getting arrested or embarrassed in court i'm sad to say this isn't the case. 

so after i sent sd the text telling her to stop contacting me she began to blow my phone up with voice mails and texts. i saved them all obviously and forwarded them to my fathers attorney. the day after i made my first post my attorney had a letter sent to sd. won't post the letter here but i'll paraphrase to the best of my ability while trying to interpret all the legal talk

""if you believe your child's claim to my clients estate is legitimate please submit to a dna test as your earliest convenience. if an independent dna test confirms your claims of my clients paternity to your child we will see to having him compensated as according to local laws for the requested child support. on the claim of getting a potion of the estate, my client specified in his will that his estate would be left to his children fakefather21 and sister. unless you are able to provide the letter of recognition as you stated in my office on the 22nd we will consider that your child was either disowned or unacknowledged by my client and will proceed as such. if you are unable to provide the claimed letter i advise you seek legal council of your own. 

on the topic of you continued contact with my clients benefactors i suggest you cease it immediately. they have made it clear that they do not wish to associate with you outside of legal dealings. if you continue to contact them i have recommended they take legal action against you""

the best part has to be how he ended it however

""if there is the possibility that your claims of my clients paternity to your child are misinformed or fraudulent i suggest you admit to this and cease contact with me and my clients. if you continue these action under false claims not only will you be receiving a bill for my time, i will suggest that my clients take legal action against you.""

while this was going on my sister tracked down sb's parents and got into contact with them. it turns out that sb has not had contact with her parents in multiple years, but that is not the important part. apparently this is not the first time she has done this. apparently she pulled the same stunt with another man when this kid was born 9 years ago and got paid off to leave him alone. i also forwarded this to my attorney

so fast forward to this morning when i get a call from my attorney. sb is retracting her statements claiming she ""misunderstood"" the situation and no longer believes her son is my fathers kid.

so yeah, no big dramatic ending sadly but i guess this is over. thanks for the advice originally. i know some people were asking why i came here when i already had an attorney, and to be honest i see where you guys are coming from. i was pretty stressed and with this woman trying to steal what my father had worked his whole life for i really just needed a place to vent and look for advice on what i should do. thanks for that.

"being very poor for 9 months has given me incredible perspective on things.. the past year was really, really tough. i think i made something like $7,000 last year. and i pay rent, and eat, and have a phone bill. i don't live at mom and dads. i'm 27.

honestly, i sponged more than i would have liked a lot. even living an incredibly miserly life doesn't cut it when you're earning virtually nothing. but i have a huge amount of personal pride when it comes to borrowing money and i never allowed that to get ridiculous. the sum total of money borrowed is about $750 from various friends. i achieved this by basically doing nothing ever, and eating chicken soup 7 days a week. the weight of this debt was absolutely crushing me. the embarrassment of not being able to buy my own beer and having my friends check up on me all the time was just too much.

they were really sympathetic, but they just don't understand the level of poorness. they don't understand what it means to be so broke that it's actually amusing that a monthly bank fee can destroy your plans of eating for the next 2 days. i mean, we're not students anymore. they've all got careers or at least well paying full-time employment. being poor to them means not going out on both friday *and* saturday. so they invite you over (""don't worry, we'll supply the beer"") but meanwhile you're having a panic attack because what if one calls you and asks you to grab a couple of lemons? they've never even considered that buying a lemon might be a supremely luxurious way to waste 50% of all the money you have in the world. wait, can i even justify the bus fare? maybe i could do the 2-hour walk and just apologize for turning up 2 hours late?

those are the friends who were really great though. understandably, i pissed off some people along the way. i lost a friend who was a former housemate (he kicked me out). my current housemate had late rent delivered to him, and he was more than good about it. but he was still pissed off. my brother was sometimes covering my phone bill, and he has a young child and a single income. i felt fucking awful, and like i couldn't do anything about it. 

so picture my lifestyle. i've set up the cheapest possible way of living - almost no money coming in, but very little going out. tiny room, growing apart from friends all the time, becoming more depressed every day. i had completely forgotten what financial independence meant. and every day i had the fear of not knowing what the hell i would do when my already dying phone were to break, or my clothes all to wear out, or an unexpected bill to roll in.

anyway, a fortnight ago i got a new job. a proper career job. i went from $7k (""salary"") to $58k salary.  they love me there, and i love the job. last friday the first paycheck rolled in. i got square with my rent, i paid back nearly all of my debts. i went out with my friends and bought *them* their drinks. 

and now i have enough to live on for the next fortnight without being a total hermit. and after that i will be completely fine.

it's difficult to explain just how relieving that is. to think that i will have more money coming in in 2 weeks than i have seen in my bank account for nearly a year. 

so now i don't take it for granted. just because i *can* go out and buy breakfast for $60 doesn't mean i will. this is something i used to do when i had a job and no sense of responsibility. but i never want to be in the position again of being mortally afraid of what would happen if i get so much as an an unexpected $100 bill. 

anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest. i love this sub and read it every day. until recently i felt powerless to take any advice from it though.

edit 2: a lot of people are asking how i managed to survive on $7k, and how i managed to go from $7k to $58k so suddenly. 

part of the explanation for that is i guestimated the american dollars. i'm in australia. i think the money i made last year was actually $12k in australian money, but i tried to adjust for cost of living. i'm earning $58k australian. it's a good entry level salary for an industry that i have a couple of years experience in.

why did i go for so long on such a small amount of money? complicated situation where i was working with a (now former) friend and taking a director role. i was trying to make a business succeed that had failed a year before and i just didn't realise it. i was working a lot of hours, hoping that we would make that one or two big deals to change our pathetic lives into million dollar dreams. i learned a lot of lessons. sure, i could have got a grocery job, but i wanted to make it happen.

"need something done? call legal. tl/dr: can't get a corporation to do their job? call their legal department and ask/tell them about their liability.

story: the cable/internet provider's underground junction box on my corner had a broken latch, making the cover not sit correctly on the box. it's a big junction box, about 2'x4', and the kids who gather at the bus stop there were always playing with it and leaving it ajar. i wanted it fixed because (a) didn't want some kid getting hurt, and (b) eventually something would break and i'd lose my internet.

i called the customer service line several times and nothing got done.

so i called the corporate main number and asked for legal. person asked how to direct my call and i told them i wanted to ask someone about their liability for injuries caused by their equipment.  got a lawyer on the phone and told them about the situation, and that i was sure they would want to fix it asap because ""if a child gets hurt there i'm sure you don't want that liability falling on you."" made sure to ask for their name, title, email address, and direct phone line and to mention that i would email my notes from our conversation to them, and would welcome any comments/corrections if i missed anything.

"i (28m) wrongly accused my gf (24f) of cheating, don't know how to move forward.. basically my (28m) girlfriend (24f) was acting shady. 
by shady i mean that she was on her phone a lot, making phone calls and i saw payments from her card for events and things i wasn't doing with her. 

i waited it out a week or two and the weirdness continued. she fell asleep and i went through her phone and found bookings for a hotel at the weekend in a city a while away and tickets for some sporting event on that weekend. 

i woke her up and shoved the phone at her, demanding she explain. she looked distraught and said ""do you really think i'd do that?"" and began to cry. she then told me to look at the bookings properly and when i did my heart sank. 

we rarely get time off together and she had booked me the weekend off through my boss as a suprise, booked a hotel in the city i said i wanted to visit and it just so happened my team were playing in that city that weekend so she'd spent a good amount on tickets. she'd also booked a table at my favourite restaurant. 

i instantly realised how stupid i'd been and i can't believe my first thought was that she would betray me when she's given me no reason to distrust her. it's kinda tainted the suprise weekend and she's so disheartened. i've tried to apologise but she's just shut off from me and is so hurt by my assumptions.

"she (36/f) broke something i (37/m) built in my free time. i am still sad about this and having trouble moving past it.. tl;dr at top: got into a huge argument with the wife, went out to do a chore she asked me to do, came back to a project destroyed. feeling really sad and want to move past it. 

most nights when my wife comes home, she doesn't even talk to me. she immediately gets on her phone and binge watches yet another series. she's able to live on far less sleep than me, so she can stay up for hours watching netflix and i only really have 45 minutes or an hour where i'm awake that we can do anything. 

i asked her what she's watching and commented that i wish i could be part of the shows she watches, or just offer occasionally to watch one of her shows with me. this gets into a huge, screaming fight where she tells me that i say she never does anything for me. i just keep trying to reiterate that she lives her whole life around binge watching and i'm ok with her having her own thing, but it'd be nice to be included occasionally.

i had to run out and do a chore that she asked me to do because she was too tired. she called me when i was out and told me she broke something, i couldn't understand her and she wouldn't pick up the phone after she hung up on me. 

in my very limited free time between kids, work, and her, i was trying to build an enclosure for my 3d printer, just to keep the heat in and the draft out. nothing fancy, frankly it wasn't special, and all i did was the wood framing and i had the panels cut to attach to the sides and to make the door. but it was something i made. she smashed it with a hammer.

i honestly wanted to cry. i know that isn't a manly thing to admit to, but life has been difficult lately. to condense it a little, i am not even remotely successful in my professional life, personal life, or family life, and it's depressing. these little projects are sometimes the only thing that makes me feel like i'm doing something in my life correctly. even if it's some small, relatively meaningless thing. 

it's the next morning and we're past the apologies at this point, and she ""apologized"" for that, but immediately said it should've been something more valuable like the actual 3d printer or my laptop (something i worked 50+ hours of overtime for weeks to earn), so it doesn't feel like an apology as much as it feels like a threat of future property destruction. 

so honestly i'm really sad about it. i don't really feel angry about it, i just feel really sad. it logically doesn't contribute much to anything especially in the shape it was in, but i worked on it and i was going to work on it. i tried to get her to understand by saying it'd be like if i tore up a page of poetry she wrote, or a short story, or a sewing project, etc - it was something i put my limited amount of time and energy into and it felt good to do it. now i'm not sure how i'm going to get the motivation to throw it away (it's completely destroyed), much less try to make it again.

to sum it up in a question - is there a trick to feeling better about this sooner? how do i move to the forgiveness part of this? ",7

what is perfectly legal but creepy as hell?. ,1
"for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?. my family and i grew up very poor. from when i was old enough to legally work, i (19f) have had to take on multiple jobs while balancing school to help with my family and my younger sister. growing up, i never had a lot and whatever money i earned i would spend on my sister (16f) and family. when i was 18 and had just been accepted into college, my dad's business that he'd worked on for the past couple of years finally took off. this also meant that my sister could now have a normal high school experience without worrying about money.

while i was in college, i wasn't in contact with my sister that much since i was so busy with schoolwork. however, from our calls and her social media, i could tell she had changed completely and was involved with some bad people. she would post videos on her snapchat of her getting drunk, smoking weed, juuling, driving while most likely drunk/high, etc. i tried reaching out to her, but she would mostly deny the claims and told me to mind my own business. at some point, she justified her actions using the argument, ""this is what the cool kids do now, not everyone was a nerd like you in high school."" one of my high school friends who also has a brother in the same grade reach out to me and said that she heard that my sister was seeing a sketchy guy from another school. apparently he sells drugs and was expelled from my sister's high school. i asked my sister about this and she denied it. 

last week i got a phone call from my mom who was sobbing. she tells me that my sister is pregnant. i was so shocked that i could not speak. then i was angry. when i was her age and even younger, i gave her everything and so did my parents so she could have all the opportunities her peers had. since my dad's business became lucrative, they've given her every opportunity to succeed (any extracurricular/sport she wants, academic tutoring, school activities, etc.). i never got any of those things. it angered me so much that she took all of this for granted and fucked up her life. the father? her delinquent ""boyfriend"" who got expelled and sells drugs. 

she blows up my phone but i don't respond. she then sends me a series of long text messages asking if she can crash at my place. she also asked me if i could make her an appointment to see a doctor. lastly, she asked if it would be okay if her boyfriend comes and stays over sometimes. i shut her down. i told her that you dug this hole for yourself. if you allowed yourself to become pregnant, then you should be able to deal with the consequences. also, i'm currently sharing a small apartment with two roommates! she begged some more and i denied her. in the past few days, she's still be texting me and calling me non-stop saying that she has nowhere to go and has been living in her boyfriend's car. i haven't responded to a single message of hers, but i feel my resolve wavering a bit. i fully don't support her, but maybe i'm being an asshole?

edit: to clarify, i would still never house her in my apartment. that would be extremely disrespectful towards my roommates and would get me kicked out due to the lease agreement. i meant i was considering giving in and sending her some money.

edit 2: my parents have disowned her, not kicked her out. they are refusing to acknowledge that she is their daughter, but she is still welcome to live in their house. she chose not to since my parents are absolutely fuming and probably will yell at her and criticize her, which she honestly needs.",3
"accused of sexually abusing my infant son by batshit mil.. throwaway for obvious reasons. bear with me.

my insane christian mil hates me. i listen to metallica and megadeth, therefore i am the reincarnation of lucifer.

yesterday i was changing our son's (6 months old) nappy, he had poop all over the place, because he's a baby. i cleaned around his anus and my mil shreaked at the top of her lungs:

""you just sexually abused your son! you fucking vile pig."" our son, obviously almost jumped off the changing table with shock and was in hysterics. 

mil started slapping me around the back of the head, shoulders and back.

wife came in and almost had to carry mil out of the room. i'm in a state of shock, i have to calm our son down and finish cleaning him. can hear mil and fil raging in the background. hear the front door slam.

mil now says she's calling cps and has reported the ""sexual abuse"" of our son.

what's my recourse here? when cps show up, do i bar them from entering and explain the waste of time they're in for? do i let them in? do i hire a lawyer and look for a cease and desist?

i'm worried about letting cps in because people have told me that they will take a dim view of me (the father) being the one looking after him while my wife is working. is there any truth to that?

i'm fairly certain she will call cps because she has called the police on me in the past for driving my wife's car.

so he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. one little boy stands up and offers, ""if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that'd be a tragedy.""

""not quite"", says mr. trump, ""that would be an accident.""

a little girl raises her hand: ""if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.""

""i'm afraid not,"" explained the president. ""that's what we would call a great loss.""

the room goes silent. trump searches the room. ""isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? ""

finally at the back of the room, little johnny raises his hand. in a quiet voice he says, ""if air force one, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.""

""fantastic!"" exclaimed mr. trump. ""that's right. and can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?""

"update: logged onto facebook, the first post that came up was a picture of my bf making out with another girl.. original post here: https://redd.it/85bopp

first off, thank you to everyone for their kind words, stories and opinions! i am honestly speechless, you have all been wonderful!

i broke things off with him shortly after posting to this thread. i actually took a screenshot of the post on my phone and sent it to him with the caption ""bye"". i then deleted him off all of my social media and blocked his number from my phone. i have 0 intention on contacting him ever again. he doesn't deserve a chance to explain himself. a picture is worth a thousand words and there were five of them.

i messaged the woman who posted the photos in question on facebook. i told her that the guy she was seeing was my ex and that he cheated on me with her. i told her that i in no way, shape, or form blame her for the cheating, since i doubted that she knew about me. i told her that my message was sent in peace and that if she choose to continue seeing him, i would not interfere. i thought she had the right to know his true colours.

the woman messaged me back and profusely apologized. she deleted the post and swiftly broke up with him as well. i have since learned, with her help, that he had been sleeping with various women since he was posted to petawawa. so he's been cheating on me for at least two months. the woman and i are now friends.

i have no interest in dating right now, but i figure that i will give it another go in september, when i start my masters degree. i'm pumping the breaks on ldrs.

to the military men of reddit: i will not count out dating a military man in the future just because one of you happened to be a rotten apple. i thank all of you (and the military women!) for your service and i hope that you find and so worthy of your time.

a couple of people have chosen to bring up a previous post i made about not contacting your so everyday. i 100% stand by my post and what i said. there needs to be some level of trust between you and your so. if you prefer texting everyday, that's fine. if you're not a big texter, that's fine too! to each their own.

again, thank you for everyone who cared to comment! you are all lovely people :)

"your emotional support animal is not a service animal and should not get the same privileges that real service animals get. i work the door at a walmart, and up until recently, we havent been able to say anything to anyone about having their pet with them unless it was in the cart (for sanitary reasons.) but recently we have a new policy and only service animals are allowed and we can only ask if the animal is a service animal or not. on the sign we have out front it clearly states that emotional support animals are not allowed as they arent service animals. had a lady come in with a dog in the seat of the cart that didnt have a vest on, nor did the lady have the documentation for the animal, (not that i asked, since we cant ask for documentation.)

when i asked her if the dog was a service animal, she replied ""no, he is my emotional support animal."" i calmly let her know about the new policy, and how she cant have the dog in the cart regardless. she starts going off on me for discrimination, and i wait for her to be done talking and walk her over to the sign and point out where it says that she cant have an emotional support animal. she is still going off on me. so i call a manager on my radio and let then deal with it. the whole thing ends with the lady taking a deli sandwhich and basically tearing the thing apart inside the packaging then opening it up and dumping it on the floor, then she stomps on the small package of mayo and it sprays on the floor. 

it's crazy the amount of stuff people think they can get away with just cause they have a ""support animal"" you still have to follow the same rules as anybody else, and chances are, that isint even a registered support animal anyway, you just cant go 30 seconds without fido. leave the damn dog at home.",6
"by laying an egg during sex. i have posted this elsewhere, but i feel like you guys deserve to hear it.  it just happened a few weeks ago. 

backstory; my bf and i have been experimenting with new sex toys lately. we bought some tenga eggs b/c he has an issue with sensation. some kind of mental block due to past traumas. i thought maybe they would help by increasing sensation and distracting his wandering mind.


we had tried the egg a few different ways, and i had looked up some porn vids to get ideas of different things. i saw one particular video showing a couple having piv with the tenga egg on the penis. i thought it might be a bit difficult to get it due to my small size (as a petite woman, i am petite everywhere) but figured we'd give it a go. 

after a bit of fumbling and slipping, with tons of lube, we finally get it in. it's staying at the base and doing just fine. he says it's a bit too tight, but we keep going in hopes that my muscles will let up a bit as they usually do.

he's getting a good rythym going and we hear a kind of popping/slurp sound. i think ""oh great, we just ripped it"". so we stop to inspect it. i looked at his dick and it wasn't there. i started feeling around in the sheets to see where this thing slipped to. can't find it.

suddenly we both looked at each other. the same thought crossed both of our minds. ""is it...? oh god."" 

i stick a finger inside myself to see if i can feel it, nothing. it must be way up there. i get up onto my knees, he's intently staring at me at this point, freaking out. i'm totally calm because, as a woman (who has used menstrual cups), i know anything that goes in can come out with enough effort. i start to bear down, and feel some pressure. 

yep, it's definitely in there. i stick my finger in again and bear down. i feel the smooth side, but can't locate the hole. it had flipped onto it's side. i continue to bear down and attempt to turn it. i finally caught my finger on the rim and slowly pulled it out. when it came out it made a loud sluuuurp sound and flopped onto the bed. 

all while he was looking on in horror. i immediately started laughing my ass off. it took us about 10 minutes to collect ourselves. i tossed the egg into the sink so that we could wash it later. we then finished off where we started, sans tenga egg.

later when we were getting into the shower, he grabbed the egg and handed it to me. he said ""don't leave your child unattended""

we now refer to it as our child.

tldr; fucked up by getting a tenga egg stuck in my vagina. had to birth it out, but it went *okay*

"update: company car i was driving was hit by a drunk driver. insurance fully paid for the car but the company says i still owe them $40,000 ca. original post here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3hwt4a/company_car_i_was_driving_was_hit_by_a_drunk/) the tl;dr version is that i was almost killed by a drunk driver while i was driving a company car. his insurance paid the blue book value ($40,000) to the company but i was sent to collections and told that i owed them $40,000 for the car because i didn't return it to them in the condition which they gave it to me. 

no one at the company or the collections agency would help me and they just sent me back and forth (company told me to talk to collections, collections told me to talk to the company) so i ended up getting a lawyer because the stress of being hounded by collections was setting back my recovery.

the lawyer sent a very strongly worded letter to someone high up that i couldn't reach myself because i kept getting the run around. that person didn't know anything about it and the company launched an investigation. the three people who kept giving me the run around ended up being charged with fraud and a bunch of other stuff. i don't know much but the police say they have emails and they think the 3 were planning on keeping the payment for themselves since the company was already paid. they are also in trouble for fraudulently using company resources to send me to collections for a fake debt.

afterward my company wrote me a letter of apology. they paid the costs for my lawyer and made sure the debt was removed from my record. they also made a donation to a charity of my choice. i am nearly ready to return to work but they told me to take as much time as i need. after talking with the police i believe the higher ups were not aware because the police say the 3 were trying to keep it a secret. the drunk driver's insurance is paying all my bills related to the incident so i won't have debt from this ever.

all in all i am doing much better. i would like to thank /r/legaladvice and everyone who offered advice and encouragement and sent me supportive messages. you were all so helpful and i appreciate it :)",2
"i've been raped 3x and my views on rape are kinda fucked up. remorse

i've been raped 3 times. 

the first time i was drunk and went to  bed alone (in a hostel, dorm style but empty except for me) and woke up in the middle of the night to the brother of the guy i'd lost my virginity to the previous day having sex with me.

the second time was aggressive - there was no actual violence but i was held down and definitely physically forced, against vocal protests.

the third time i believe i was drugged - i had two drinks and the next thing i knew i woke up in a hotel with a pounding headache next to a guy i'd never seen before who was probably 25 years older than me. he insisted we hadn't had sex but there was a condom in the trash can and, well, as a girl you can usually pretty much feel if you had sex very recently.

none of these experiences affected me really at all. i'm not traumatized in the least. 

i think that's why i have fucked up views about rape. i know logically that rape is awful, but it just doesn't really set off my ""oh my god what a horrific thing to have happen"" bells. with some exceptions, i guess. i can see how a straight man might be very traumatized to be forced into sex with another guy. i can see how it would be awful to get violently raped and injured, but even in that case it's more the violence than the unwanted sex that makes me go ""oh fuck no."" 

i don't get it, and i wish i did because i am aware that i am pretty much objectively wrong about this. i would definitely, a gazillion times over, get raped than murdered. hell, i'd rather get raped than have my arm broken. 

i would never express this in real life because as i said, i'm aware that i am wrong and abnormal, and there are many people who are legitimately deeply traumatized by their experiences of rape.

what's wrong with me? downvote away.",11

"by telling girl i had small penis before i got anything. so it all started on a date to the movies at a pretty local area. everything was going well, we made out in the theater, had some good laughs enjoyed food and genuinely had a good time. (as good as a date to the movies could go)

i could tell she liked me a lot cause she kept getting close to me and we had some pretty deep conversations for a first date. i'd been talking to the girl on the phone for about a week before, but she seemed to feel comfortable around me so i was pretty happy to have someone who i could connect too. 

we made out a couple more times behind some buildings and on benches and stuff and kept talking, holding hands, felt like we'd been dating for months but it was still a first date. we met through some of our mutual friends that we originally went on the date with but separated after the movie. it was pretty dark and we were walking on a pretty unpopulated path behind the theater/mall. she took my hand to an alley/bushy area not visible to the main road. she looked at me in the eyes kissed me and said ""can i go down?""

i said yes! ""but i'm not gonna lie it's not that big, like at all"" i know i facepalmed instantly! she said ""oh... well, maybe it's not time then?"" she got back up and said ""sorry i asked..."" i didn't say anything cause i was just freaking the fuck out.

the entire date from there was awkward and i could have easily just said ""no it's fine"" but i didn't. today is a regretful day ladies and gentleman... a regretful day indeed.

"if i asked my neighbour to stop ""borrowing"" my dog to distract her autistic son?. i've had this dog since i was a kid and he's getting on in years now, but he's still pretty spritely for his age. i play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.

i have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. she also has a 12yo autistic son (alex). he's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. so one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and i got text saying, ""hi! hope it's okay but i sent alex to walk your dog."" i said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and i figured that was the end of it.

nope. alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so i'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and i'll panic), and then the neighbour will also ""borrow"" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract alex. i really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since i'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.

i've just got a few issues with some of it. one, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and i like having him close by. i have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. now, i get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and i miss out on bonding with him outdoors.

two -- and i'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. he used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. i vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, ""oh he'll climb right onto alex's lap on the couch."" 

i complained about it to a friend last night and she said i was being selfish, since i don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). and now i feel bad, because i can see how much alex loves my dog, and i don't really want to be a dick just because i'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.",3

thank you to everyone that has commented or reached out after my last two posts. i first want to say that i am doing okay, even after what i am going to say in this post, i'm okay. i am going to attempt to make this as brief as possible because i can't give this situation any more of my heart or energy. but it will most likely be long. *here we go*.

i am all moved out of the apartment, my things going into storage because i am still staying in my friend's home for the time being. this break up has proved to be financially burdensome but somehow money has managed to be the least stressful part of this ordeal. it turns out that i never knew the man i shared my life with for the past 3 years. my ex and i ended up having a conversation on the last day of us moving out. he seemed apologetic and sad and asked if we could talk. he said that he loves me, that he will always love me and he wants us to stay together. he apologized and said he would stop bullshitting, no more lies. i didn't feel the need to have a conversation but i did have just one question. i asked him ""why?""

i never could have imagined in a million years that he would tell me that the reason he cheated was because i miscarried 6 months ago. especially because of how supportive and loving he was during that period in our lives, i felt blindsided and betrayed. he said that he knows that it was not my fault, that there was nothing i could have done differently but it had caused him to resent me. that he was angry. he said he knew how this sounded which is why he never talked to me about it. he didn't want to hurt me - ha. i of course at this point felt sick. my heart hurt in ways i never knew possible. even the death of my father did not hurt in ways his words and actions were hurting me. here is this man that i have unconditionally loved and supported for over three years. i was his biggest cheerleader in life, encouraged him to be his own person and to still live his own life. i wanted him to be happy. we never went to bed mad at each other, we never called each other names, we never not kissed each other goodnight or goodbye in the morning. our relationship *seemed*great and yet he's telling me for the last six months he has resented me, borderline hated me at times.

he admitted to downloading tinder and chatting with women over the last six months. he swore that it never became sexual up until the night he cheated and that was only because they had history. i have no clue if that is true. honestly, i don't care whether or not it is. the cheating is minimal compared to the words he just spoke. we were both crying and i handed him my keys for him to turn in. i gave him a hug and told him that he needs therapy and that i never want to speak to or see him again. i have a therapy appointment next week and will start to work on healing.

i am looking at potentially getting a loan so i can get out of anything left that we have shared. i also want to look into moving to a different city but that is still up in the air. i have changed my phone number and blocked him everywhere. there was never a chance of him and i getting back together and this just solidifies my decision. this will most likely be my last post on the subject but i once again thank each and every one of you.",7

good news ladies and gents! some of you may remember my previous post , if not read it bc it's hilarious and has a cute cat.

the news: our boy nelson has found his furever home!

he got adopted 8 days ago and i've been waiting so see if it stuck before posting. nelson become a top priority to adopt out as he was one of our most difficult but favorite cats we took care of.

he become pet of the month and got the attention of an older gentleman who came in- get this- with a printed out copy of our facebook post. it was very adorable of him. this man automatically took us as a great candidate for nelson, since he was an experienced cat owner. he had a bit of a sad story, his wife passed last year and their 18 year old tabby passed away 4 months ago. he was very lonely and wanted to get a new friend but didn't want to get a young cat. he is older and doesn't have the energy to take care of a demanding cat. 

nelson was absolutely perfect. i have seen very very heart warming moments with pets and their new families but this one was a top. as you guys may remember nelson is a cranky asshole that you can't help but love. he's not really nice and he is stand off ish but i shut you not when we brought him into the meeting room he pranced over to the man and hopped up onto his lap. my jaw almost hit the floor.

after 30 minutes if nelson going ap shit over this man he was adopted and went off to his new home. 
the man has sent us photos and updates of nelson since then and it seems to be going very very well. i guess he speaks cat. 

i won't be posting photos as the man is in them and ya know, i'm trying to not get in trouble at work again. 

thank you guys for being nelson's biggest fans and i'm so stoked that both of them got a happy ending together

"i was a shitty kid to an awesome dog. i was a young, stupid, angry, depressed kid. we had an awesome big lovable oaf of a dog. all that dog wanted was love and attention. i only realized it when i was older, and he was literally a week away from being put to sleep. we aren't bad people, i was the bad one. my dad was hardly at home working two jobs to support us, and my mother was absent for reasons i am not going to say here. 

it was my responsibility to take care of the dog. walks, food, attention. i remember days he would howl and whine for attention, and all he would get is me yelling at him to shut up. he wasn't allowed inside, even on -30 degree weather. (we had a garage with a heater in it   and big cushy beds for him so he wouldn't freeze). and times where i was the only one around for a couple days, and i would only feed him and then go back downstairs to play games. it hurts to say that more than once he has gone without food or water. i would get back from school and he would see me walking up the driveway and he would jump around excited and i would walk past him after a pet and he wouldn't see me until the next morning when i left for school. sometimes i didn't want him to get excited so i would be as quiet as possible so he wouldn't hear me. this got easier as he got older and his hearing left. ( now i am crying )

when i did walk him, at least 1-2 a week, i wouldn't let him sniff or have any freedom, just a quick walk around the block. sometimes i would walk us in the middle of the street so he wouldn't sniff anything. lots of times i would yank him to keep walking.

years went on, he outlived 3 other animals we had. eventually our family stabilized and he started living how a dog should live. walks, attention and love. he had this for the last year of his life. later, i eventually grew up (emotionally and mentally), got help and therapy. i walked him every day for my benefit and his. little did i know, shortly in the future he would be put down. he was getting old, difficulty walking and standing up in the morning. we've been giving him pills for a while by this point, but it was time. i was fucking breaking up. i discovered the most lovable dog, realized all the shit i did to him, all the lonely nights he had and trying to make up for it. only to learn he was basically on his deathbed.

i remember the day of, and i was sitting on the lawn with him and he sauntered about sniffing the grass and trees. he was too old to play fetch now, so i sat there holding his kong dog toy. boy did he ever go through those toys like crazy. i knew it was time, my parents and the vet were in the back yard ready for him. i called him over, hugged him and took off his collar. it's amazing how loose it was on him now. his thick muscular neck was so thin now. i never noticed. i couldn't be there with him when he took the deep sleep. i went to my room, placed the collar on my dresser and wept. its still there. 

we found some old pictures, and this is why i made this post. it keeps reminding me how awful i was, and how much of a great dog he was who only wanted love.

"(md) i think my dead son's boss might have contributed to his death, but nobody will listen to me. my son was never a good kid, from very young he pushed boundaries with everyone and got really into drugs and alcohol. i'm saying this because it explains a lot.

he first started using heroin when he was 15. according to him he basically got addicted immediately. but when he was 19, after being kicked out of the house, arrested a couple times, he came to us and finally asked for help. he eventually got clean and stayed clean for a little over a year, was starting to put together a life.

he got his first job at age 20. it was as a busser at a local restaurant. though he was excited at first, eventually it became clear this was a toxic environment.

one of the owners, who i will call 'sara' took a particular dislike to my son. she would call him and other busser with a similar backstory (1+ year sober addict) ""the junkies"" to their faces. she would steal shifts from my son because he didn't come in wearing the logoed shirt for the restaurant, but rather a very similar black polo without the logo (this was common practice for other employees, as they were only given one uniform shirt, and nobody seemed to have any issue with that). 

after four months of working there i wake up late one night to find him overdosing on our couch, and he dies. mind you, he had been clean for a month over a year at this point, and seemed like he was happy with that, so i was in shock.

anyway, as for my legal question, a month ago (around a month and a half after his death) a women who introduced herself as a manager/bartender at the place he had worked knocked on my door and said she wanted to show me a video. she explained that she had been worried about how 'sara' treated son for a while, so on the day my son died when sara started to pick a fight with him she secretly recorded it on her phone.

the video shows sara drunkenly screaming at my son as he tries to do his job. she is telling him that he is a waste of time and space and should just fucking kill himself. taunting him and asking him if he is back to sticking a needle into his arm yet so she can fire him. she even takes a swing at him.

mind you, this is in the middle of dinner service and in front of customers. i strongly suspect this is what triggered his relapse (and what i suspect was more a suicide then a simple relapse). 

my question was if i had any legal recourse against the restaurant based on their treatment of my son. the other manager that gave me the video also said that she could probably find some people who witnessed other similar incidents. 

but the thing is that anyone i bring this up to in my small town just laughs and blows it off. when i brought it to the local lawyer his exact words were, ""well he was a fucking junkie, you want to sue the only people who were stupid enough to hire him?"" i know that he was seriously mistreated, and worse then that from what the restaurant manager implied it sounds like the restaurant may be knowingly targeting heroin users and/or ex-users, using them for a few months until they either get tired of the bullshit or relapse, and then firing them for a new round of the same.",2

"for cutting off contact with my son due to him refusing to accept his own responsibilities as a paren. i am a father to 3 ""young adult"" (ages 18, 22 and 24) sons who live with me and who for the most part have always gotten along (normal brotherly fights but nothing serious). however throughout this summer i've noticed a bit of a tension between them. i told my youngest to spill the beans since i figured the conflict was between the older two since they seemed the most tense. my youngest tired to avoid eye contact and kept trying to play dumb but i kept pushing. my eldest child had some bad history of impulsive behavior when he was a few years younger (the worst being an incident which resulted in his expulsion from college) but he had been slowly improving his life and i didn't want to be too late to help him if he had done something to jeopardize iti really didn't want my youngest keeping secrets.

when i finally got the truth out i was in shock, it turns out that middle child gathered a baby (my granddaughter) over a year ago, but had refused to even see the child. my oldest found out since he happens to work with a cousin of the mother, and he has been trying to get his brother to take responsibility and be there for his child, but he has refused. 

i confronted my middle child and we got into a huge fight. he claimed that being a father would ruin his plans for life but i told him that he had to take responsibility for his own actions and that his child deserved to have a father in her life.

this went on for a while when i told him that if he didn't think his own child deserved a father then he didn't deserve a father himself and i told him that he had to leave the house. he is 22 years old and has a decent job and plenty of friends so i wasn't too worried about him. 

i have met my granddaughter and her family and have made some plans to sell my house and downsize to begin a college fund for her since my youngest child will go to college and my oldest has been saving up to move out. 

it has been about a month now and while i feel like i made the correct decision, i still feel terrible. i chose to end my relationship with my son, which hurts so much, since i have always felt closest with him throughout his life (he had the same interests that i had and was the most willing to spend time with me) i feel horrible that i raised a kid who was willing to not care about a human he helped create, i feel like i ruined any chance of a relationship between him and my youngest son, and i feel guilty since my wife has been crying a lot the last few weeks and i don't know how to fix anything.

edit: he is also incredibly lackluster at paying his child support, he has to be told to do it and even then he is reluctant.

"for being mad at my parents for ignoring safety tips i told them about visiting my area?. 
my parents are pretty well off, they live in a suburban area where it's pretty expected to ""keep up with the joneses"" and show off with nice cars, spending a lot on a house and on entertaining, designer clothes, etc. but they don't have a lot of savings and that stresses me out.

anyway, i am kind of the opposite. i'm living in an area that's kind of rough right now, driving an old truck, but it's close to my work and it's close to my friends places. i'm saving a lot doing all this. i've paid off my student loans already and i'm saving for a house.

my parents wanted to come visit the city i'm living in, and i said i'd host them at my apartment. but i said to leave the luxury cars behind and take the older sedan that they'd been using as a driving-instruction car for me and my siblings. and i told them to not leave any valuables in the car, instead bring their things inside my apartment. and also, don't bring a large purse or backpack and don't talk to strangers who approach you because they might try and pickpocket you. 

so my parents showed up in their 2018 porche and my mom steps out with a huge designer handbag that doesn't close except for a small snap closure on top. and i'm frustrated they didn't listen but i tell them to come inside, being their things in, and i lend my mom a smaller handbag of mine.

we went out for dinner and when we come back, their car's been broken into. and my dad is freaking out because a bag of his things was stolen. i was frustrated because i'd said to not bring a flashy car and to not leave things in the car... but we go file a police report and that takes up most of the night.

i got snappy at my parents that night for not listening to one of the things i'd said; bringing their flashiest car when i'd said that was a bad idea, etc.

and they got mad at me for having said that they probably won't see their stuff again.

"unbeknownst to me (32m) my wife (30f) is back on birth control. i had a vasectomy years ago. as the title says, i have had a vasectomy done when i was 25. we are both child free so it only made sense to have a permanent solution rather than using condoms or other forms of contraception. my wife used to be on the pill but always complained about how annoying it was taking it and so on. we did not have any issues for all these years and neither ever mentioned birth control since.


fast forward to now, we recently moved into a new home and i am tasked with redoing a bathroom. after i installed the vanity, i begun putting our stuff in it. my wife has a small pouch where she keeps her ""travel kit"" for her work trips. it's a toothbrush, paste, small bottle of mouthwash, makeup and ibuprofen. i was having a terrible headache and our house has been upside down for a while now, so when i remembered that she keeps pain killers in that pouch, i opened it to get one. inside, i found birth control pills. it would make no sense for her to keep the pills from 7 years ago, especially since she has used this pouch multiple times for her work trips. it's not like i found them in a long forgotten corner. 

then, for the first time in our 10 year relationship, i doubted her. i sat on the couch and started to think of all the possible reasons she might be taking those behind my back. for one, she is on my health insurance so i would see if she had a doctor's appointment for an issue unrelated to contraception. i know that bc pills are used for other purposes. she is healthy and would certainly share with me if something was wrong medically. why would she hide it? especially in the light of her complains regarding the pill. 

i decided to put the pills back in there and act like i didn't see them that night. i checked back the next morning and sure enough, another pill was missing. so, she is actively taking them. i'm lost. part of me doesn't want to know and i wish i could just erase that from my memory. we are happy together, we have a wonderful life, and i cannot prepare for it all to come crumbling down. i'm not ready to learn that she is cheating but i can't go on without knowing what's going on. 

how do i approach this without sounding accusatory? if she genuinely has a medical problem, and i cannot imagine she had and would hide it from me, i don't want to make her feel attacked. tell me there's a good reason why she would take the pills. 

tl;dr: had a vasectomy years ago, found that wife is back on birth control without my knowledge

edit: wow guys, i was at work and came back to a lot of replies. i'm reading through them now and the general consensus seems to be that she likely has a valid medical reason for taking them. she'll be home soon and i will have the conversation.

edit 2: she is likely cheating. i'm still shocked/mad/upset and can't write everything right now but we discussed and she had a very weird reaction to me bringing it up. first she accused me of ""going through her things"". then she said it doesn't matter anyway because she has nothing to hide. she could not explain the reason behind her taking the pills. why is this happening.",7
"lpt - you can see if your ice cream carton has been tampered with by how easily the lid comes off. the cartons are ""hardened"" in freezers upside-down, so the ice cream sticks to the lid. you should have to tug the lid off the first time. if it comes off too easily, that's evidence of tampering.. edit: some brands come with tamper-evident packaging, either a cellophane ring around the lid or a film under the lid. **but many do not**, that natural seal formed by the ice cream hardening against the lid is what they rely on.

edit 2: okay so to address a common comment here, no, the ice cream softening while being transported from truck to store case or from the store to your house won't unstick the lid. even slightly softened the ice cream stays ""tacky"" and adheres to the lid until it goes back in the freezer and firms up again. 

this form of packaging is just as ""tamper evident"" as a ring around the lid or a film under the lid. it does have a safety seal. the ice cream is the seal. 

no, once you really pull lid off, you can't stick it back on with your spit. it takes softened ice cream pressing right up against the lid then going in a special hardening freezer at about -30f to form the seal. once you break it, it's very hard to reproduce.

"i 25m got ghosted by my girlfriend 23f of 2 years.. i dated her for 2 years. she said she loved me almost everyday. i loved her too. we had plans to move in together and eventually get married someday. we were as serious as anything. of course we had our ups and downs, but we were committed. or at least, i thought i was.

last week, i went on a business trip for 3 days. it was in london, so i was jetlagged and wasn't very responsive to her texts and calls. i warned her of this beforehand, i told her i'd be busy and tired. she said she understood. her last text to me was just a few days into my trip, it said ""heyy, hows london treating you?""

i took 2 days to respond, mostly because of connectivity issues/jetlag/busyness. i said, ""sorry i didn't respond sooner, it's been a hell of a weekend (edit: i am referring to my weekend preparing for the trip, not the trip overall which was during the week). but pretty good overall.""

she never responded to that text, or any of the others i sent. i came home and even drove to her apartment, but she wasn't there. i called her, messaged her on facebook, instagram, but she never responded, even though she was online. it is so completely bizarre and out of the blue. we weren't even in a rough patch or anything. we were just always really stable and in love.

it's been a whole week since her last text. i have no clue what's going on. she is very sensible, not the type to just ghost someone. what could be happening? i've been racking my head trying to think of things that might have led to this, but i can't think of anything. sure, i didn't reply to her for 2 days but that's not a valid reason to just ghost me entirely, right? i even warned her about it.

does anyone know what may be going on?

"for not letting my in-laws move in with us?. my husband and i recently got married and purchased a four bedroom house (the number of bedrooms is important). my husband and his family are originally from ohio (we live in utah) and his family has started moving out here for a fresh start. almost immediately after buying our house his younger brother moved in with us and has been here for about eight months; he's a great roommate and pulls his weight around the house. about 2 months ago my sil decided she needed a new start and she moved in with us (also a great roommate) now that my husband and his two siblings are living here his parents decided to move here also. i work from home and keep my home office for myself to get work done. when my in laws asked about moving down here my whole household was thrilled. when i then asked ""who's giving up their bedroom?"" everyone just went silent. i unfortunately had to pull rank on everyone and put my foot down and say i was keeping my office as of right now no one is speaking to me.



to make some clarifications since i have been asked. 

yes bil and sil pay rent. bil is off a divorce and has been talking about moving out ""some time this year"" he's a great guy and finally been getting back on his feet.   sil hasn't made the best choices in life and currently working on moving up the ranks at her job she handles most of the cleaning and pays about $200 a month in rent. mil and fil want to move in until they can find a house but i don't think they are going to move quickly on looking for said house. yes, i am a man. 


*hubs and i just made it clear bil and sil have until september to be out. no in laws moving in.*",3
"update: i'm 13 and want to know what to get my girlfriend for valentine's day. here's a link to the original post on the situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/apzmrc/im_13_and_want_to_know_what_to_do_for_my/ 


so here i am. today was valentine's day and after a lot of deciding i went with getting my girlfriend a red rose, a yellow rose (her favorite color), a heart-shaped box of chocolates that had her favorite dark chocolate, a stuffed animal which i'm pretty sure was a little puppy holding a heart (if i remember right), a pair of valentine's fuzzy socks, and a homemade card. before i get into what happened, i just want to say the card was an idea from online which can be found here(https://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/holidays/valentines-day/homemade-valentines?slide=508178#508178). i also included a message inside talking about how much she means to me and things like that. by the way, thanks to my mom who helped me get all of these gifts. to give her the gifts i put all of them in a bag except the roses which i handed to her separately.

now to the part where i actually give her the things. so i waited until the end of the day while i kept everything in my locker (yes i had aluminium foil on the stems of the roses so they didn't dry out). our final class is together and also kind of far away from our lockers (which are close to each other) so we were one of the last people out of the school. our lockers are also on the top floor so we exchanged gifts on the stairwell. i gave her the roses along with a comment which i thought was pretty good, i said, ""i tried to get the most perfect roses for the most perfect girl."" she really liked that one and i complimented her on her looks and i think she enjoyed that too. she handed me a bag with her present in it and i gave her my bag and we hugged. we walked each other to our buses and that was pretty much it. my bus driver congratulated me because he saw me with her as we were one of the last ones out. throughout the whole experience i think she was pretty happy and after getting on the buses we texted and she said thanks and sent some hearts so overall it was a success. also i forgot to mention she got me two containers full of chocolate chip cookies which i thought was really sweet because it shows she really put her time into it. i think that's all but i might be forgetting some things. remind me in the comments if i left anything out!

finally, i want to say thanks to everyone who left advice, suggestions, and comments encouraging me or helping me out. once again i am astounded with the community on reddit and you guys helped me out so much. thank you everyone!!

"had a threesome with my boyfriend and a friend last night and then woke up to them having sex. not sure what to do but i feel completely betrayed. i promised my boyfriend that for valentine's day we could have a threesome with a girl i'm friends with. we all got pretty drunk and did it, i fell asleep pretty much straight after and i woke up a couple of hours later and my boyfriend wasn't in bed, i went to get a drink and see where they were and they were on the sofa having sex. i freaked out and started screaming at them. they said they were sorry but since they'd already had sex earlier in the night they didn't think it would be a big deal. i told her to get out, it was like 3 in the morning and she was like i can't i said yes you can get an uber. i was crying and we were a.l still pretty drunk so it got really heated. my boyfriend literally held me back and told her to leave. so she got her stuff and went. 

we argued and  he kept apologising and i said i'm going to bed and we'll talk in the morning. 

he's still asleep. 

i'm feeling like i should break up with him but i don't know. i don't think a threesome is the same as them two having sex. he went behind my back and betrayed me and i just feel really hurt

"just asked my (29m) wife (26f) to leave the house. throwaway account just to maintain anonymity.

long backstory, because i've never talked to anyone about this.

so, almost a year ago, my wife, of now almost 7 years (no kids), shyly broached the conversation with me that she has discovered that shes also attracted to women. no big deal (she had made jokes before, so i suspected that it might be the case), and i love her no matter what. when she then asked if including another woman in our sex life, i said that while the seemingly ubiquitous threesome fantasy was something that intrigued me, i didn't think that it is something that would work for me, emotionally (i come from a very conservative rural area, and while a lot of my views have changed, i'm still very much a one-spouse man, and expect the same from her).

two weeks later, we went out with some new friends. we were relatively new to the area where we live, so we've been trying to establish relationships with other married couples.  we met them at a bar, where we had a couple of drinks, and hopped in the car together to go to a different club (i'm dd for the night). while on the drive, the other wife (ow, 35-ish f) of the couple and mine kissed in the car.  not super uncomfortable, i've been around damn near everything, so playing around doesnt get me to riled up.  however, after we leave the next place, both of them are pretty drunk, and they start making out in the back seat, undergarments were removed and mouths and hands were in places were in places with which i'm definitely not cool.

we come back to our house, at which point ow tries to escalate things, trying to rope other husband (oh, 35-ish m) and i in. he immediately recognizes that things aren't ok, and ushers her out the door. i'm fuming, and i leave, and dont come home until the next evening.  my wife and i have it out, and i express that what happened was not ok with me.  she swears that she doesnt remember me explicitly saying that it was something i wouldn't be ok with, let alone a whole second couple.  i also learn, after the fact, that the other couple are swingers, and have been for some time.

again, from my upbringing, i'm a firm believer that your family, and particularly marriage, comes first, and that even the worst can be overcome.  she accepts that what happened wasn't ok, and we make up.  over the course of the last 10 months or so, i've made an effort to understand her sexuality, and have even said that maybe, if the conditions were perfect, i might be willing to indulge her fantasies. by perfect, i explained that it had to include no social attachment  between us and any potential third, i'm not into having other men with us, and certainly no other couples.

over this same time period, my wife and ow become friends.  they spend time together on a nearly daily basis in the gym, but its limited to pretty much that. i have my reservations, my wife reassures me, and i come to the conclusion that i can trust her, and that any suspicions that i have are just a result of getting burned the first time.  the issue is that the text constantly, and often at odd hours. i notice that our shared computer (to which she has her imessages linked), has no record of my wife and ow or oh talking, which i know to not be the case (i.e. she blocked their conversations specifically from updating. i also now recognize the other couple's behavior as grooming. each time, i try to rest assured that i'm just being paranoid, and that i can trust her.

fast forward to last night. we're out with my friends (completely different friend group), and as the night progresses, and my wife gets more drunk, i (along with everyone else) notice that shes constantly on her phone. i also see ow's name at the top of the screen. again, i'm dd for the night, so i'm sober as a judge. as the night draws to a close, my wife starts to nod off, passing out in the passenger seat next to me.  at this point, she passes out with her screen on, with the text drunkenly enlarged to max size, so that i can see that (this sounds like some bad tv drama writing it out) shes been texting ow about how she ""wanted last night"" and she wants ""to play with both of you."" i take her home and she comes to and climbs into bed before passing out.

now my gut is in knots.  my worst suspicions are apparently true. fearing what i expect to happen, i screenshot the messages and send them to my phone for record.  i'm then up all night long.

when she wakes up, i tell her that i want her out of the house by sundown. she tries to apologize for being distant and inattentive, but never addresses anyhing about ow.  i tell her to unlock her phone and show me her messages,  and (surprise) the messages have been deleted.  she asks what i'm looking for, and i show her the screenshot that i had sent to my phone.  i get angry, but stay collected, and again tell her to leave by 6pm. i get up and walk out, at which point she comes crying after me, telling me to stay.

i'm now away from the house, because i can't stand to be around her.  i'm not even sure why i'm posting this.  i dont talk about our marital problems to anyone because i hate the idea of the jaded guy who bitches about his wife, so i guess i thought i'd vent here. there's a part of me that has hope that after time, we can make things work, but i'm so angry at her and at myself for believing and trusting her, that i dont possibly see a path to repairing things.  regardless, if anyone reads this, thanks for taking the time and letting me vent.  any advice is welcome.",7

"for paying my daughter to lose weight?. i (53m) have grown increasingly worried about my daughter's (22f) weight. it has gotten beyond the point of merely an aesthetic issue, and i have genuine concerns about her health.

she doesn't live at home, as she recently started graduate school out of town. our arrangement is that i pay for her tuition and rent, and she has a part time job that covers groceries, utility bills, spending money, etc. this works out well as i am happy to cover these expenses since she is in school. however, she often says that she wishes she earned more money, since she does not have a ton of spending money for leisure activities, clothes, etc.

i have tried to speak to her about her weight, approaching it as delicately as i could. she was actually quite receptive, and i could tell she was a bit hurt but she told me that she knew it was an issue that she should be addressing. however, currently she is not sufficiently motivated to do it, and is busy with her school and part time job so struggles to find time to go to the gym. 

i suggested that if she started going to the gym, i would give her extra money. this is to serve as a motivator, but also for practical reasons as she can pick up fewer shifts at her job and have more time to go to the gym.

the deal is $15 per hour spent at the gym. this is working on an honour system since i trust her, and i did not think it would be appropriate to pay her by pounds lost (could encourage unhealthy eating and so on). my wife thinks this is a ""disgusting"" idea, but i think i am helping her by replacing her shifts at her job with ""shifts"" at the gym - and financially compensating this.

so, for paying for my daughter to lose weight?

**edit:** a lot of comments about how her diet is the most important thing, rather than exercise. which is definitely fair. we did also speak about her diet, but her lack of exercise is the facet that had the most clear barrier (lack of time and motivation) which is why that is what i am addressing. hopefully her diet will improve as well, especially since she should have some extra money in her pockets for more expensive groceries from this arrangement.",3

"my friends didn't invite me to their wedding then made me the bad guy. **edit:** update at the bottom!  (another update will come tonight after tracey calls me when she gets out of work)

**edit two:** final update at the bottom.

sorry for the long story, i added a tl;dr. i'm definitely looking for advice but it comes with a backstory:

a friend (greg-28) in my circle of friends met (shannon-28) about 5 years ago and they immediately hit it off. everybody instantly fell in love with shannon because she's friendly and really fun to hang out with. they were everybody's favorite couple and really made our hang-outs much more fun. we all knew they were perfect for each other. they both made our crew that much better.

the engagement was expected but much welcome news. our friends circle was buzzing about the inevitable wedding. then the invitations went out.

you know those ""save the date"" magnets that people send out? well it really sucked seeing them on everybody else's fridge when i visited friends knowing i didn't get one and wasn't invited. feeling left out really sucks. but it gets worse.

i completely understand how stressful wedding planning is and i believe nobody should feel that they have to invite people they don't want to their wedding. it's their day and their ceremony and they shouldn't have to have people there who they don't want there. i didn't cause a fuss or express to anyone that i was hurt that i felt excluded from the wedding and by extension, excluded from the group. i didn't want to be looked on in an even worse way that i feel i was apparently being looked at. but one friend actually stood up for me.

when their wedding came up in conversation and people talked about booking flights and rooms (destination wedding in new york city) eventually i was asked if i booked yet. i said, ""we (me and my girlfriend) weren't invited."" nobody could believe it but i insisted that i wasn't upset because i know how situations like this can go. i didn't want to cause trouble because then the happy couple might resent me. then i'd be the bad guy.

i heard through other friends that my friend tracey thought it was really messed up that i wasn't invited. she and i never spoke of how i wasn't invited to the wedding but she really felt a certain way about it. so a month before the destination wedding i got a text from greg basically saying sorry for forgetting to send an invite but that they would love to have us come to the wedding. it was way too late at that point for me. 

i couldn't get away from my job and i didn't have a chance to put money aside for a year for an expensive nyc destination wedding like everyone else did. i didn't even get a save the date. every flight and hotel (no rooms where everyone else was staying, obviously. too late for that) was unaffordable for me. i texted him back that i couldn't make it.

the wedding came and went and i felt bad about everything. i saw the facebook pictures of my friends all having the time of their lives. it looked like a great wedding. there's even a picture of just the group of friends labeled ""the crew"". i don't think i've ever felt so left out, honestly. it really made me feel worthless and unwanted.

so naturally the typical thoughts surfaced. ""they don't like you. they think you're annoying. they think you're an asshole. if you can't identify the schmuck in a group of friends, that means you're it. they think you try way to hard to be nice and think you're a phony.""

then as if it couldn't get any worse, shannon messaged me on facebook asking why i didn't rsvp and said they missed me at the wedding? rsvp? **rsvp?** doesn't one have to be *invited* in order to rsvp? everybody got a year to prepare between getting save the dates and *actual* wedding invitations. i got a text message a month before the wedding! just as i feared, i'm being made out to be the bad guy and i even made a point to keep my feelings to myself and play it cool. 

but as usual i didn't say this to her because i know how i would end up looking. i actually apologised for... i don't even know... but i made a point to mention how i spoke with greg about it. i also made sure to compliment the wedding pictures and say it looked like fun. i did everything i could in that conversation to make it easier on her and of course now i feel like a total schmuck.

that was this past summer and i haven't seen them since. i feel like that's it for me in the group now. i see some of the friends in our group every now and then but everything feels different now. none of them even responded to my birthday party facebook invite this month. i feel like things are being said behind the scenes and i feel completely out of the loop. it felt like a passive aggressive message that maybe greg and shannon never actually liked me. my fiance gets along great with shannon and she's just confused. seeing her confusion just makes my heart break even more because she's a sweetheart who's never offended anybody in her life. i wish i could break it to her that i'm just the guy in the group that greg and shannon think sucks but i don't know how and i feel like a complete loser who deserves this.

i'll always appreciate tracey for sticking up for me. she may never know how awesome it feels hearing about how she told everybody it was messed up that i was left out. i haven't even spoken to her about how the whole thing made me feel (or anybody for that matter, reddit you are the first to hear about it) because i didn't want it to appear like i am making a stink and become even more disliked. 

this whole thing just fucking sucks. i feel like i don't have friends anymore. and to make it worse, soon i'll have a wedding of my own and i'm afraid i won't have any friends there (except for tracey, of course). how am i supposed to handle who i invite so it doesn't seem like i'm leaving people out for petty revenge? how the hell do i navigate a toxic situation that i had no hand in creating? i still feel like i'm in the dark or could be over-reacting. what the hell????

tl;dr: friends forgot or chose not to invite me to their wedding. after a friend stuck up for me i was invited via text message (with little notice), had to decline, then asked why i didn't rsvp and that i was ""missed"". soon i'll have my own wedding to plan and don't feel like i have any friends to invite/don't know if i should invite certain people/don't know how to even approach the situation i didn't create.


**update**. i half took everyone's advice and brought it up with tracey. she just confirmed that shannon was full of shit when she asked me why she didn't get my rsvp and wanted to absolve herself of guilt. i'm not sure if they forgot or if i just wasn't invited yet but tracey said we'd talk about it more tonight when she gets out of work. 

**final update:**

 i spoke about it in depth with tracey. it turns out greg's best man(someone who was never in ""the gang"" but grew up with greg) always hated me and greg thinks i'm annoying. shannon later felt bad they chose not to invite me and pressured him to invite me over text knowing i wouldn't be able to make it. also it wasn't only tracey who thought it was wrong that i didn't get an invite and the ""chatter"" is what made shannon ask me why i didn't rsvp (to make it seem like my invite was lost in the mail).

it feels better knowing this because, like i said, they don't have to have people they don't want at their wedding. but knowing greg doesn't like me fucking hurts because i always thought we were friends. turns out *he's* the phony. unfortunately everybody else (except for tracey and a few others) like greg more than me so they kinda felt like they had to choose a side after tracey (and a few ot hers, it turns out) brought up why i didn't get invited. lots of people feeling guilty about this, apparently. they still felt like they had to ""choose a side"" for whatever reason. probably because most of them went to high school with greg. 

oh well. that's life. thanks for the advice about being more assertive. those of you polite about it were very helpful. thanks.

"for calling my wife insecure. my wife (33f) and i (33m) were at a family dinner at my parents house with my brother (30m) his wife (29f) and their new baby, the little guy is about 11 weeks old. my mom and her family have always been one to compliment people on their looks and weight, so when my sil came over with the baby, my mom and aunt were gushing about how great she looked. she is a fairly active person  and does stay in shape, which is good for her, however, she embarrasses easily and is quite uncomfortable when people talk about her body, she just made a comment on breastfeeding alot and taking walks with the baby.

my wife was sitting next to me, rolls her eyes and starts muttering to me that ""i'm sure throwing up your whole pregnancy didn't help either"" i gave her a look but didn't comment, she made snide remarks about my sil the whole night.

on the car ride home, my wife is going on and on about my sil, how smug she must be to be looking like she does so soon after having a baby, and how full of her self to be putting her appearance before being a mother, and then brought up the vomiting again. 

now i've known my wife since we were in junior high, and she's always made comments about other girls like this, always. she's a bit on the bigger side and seems to have a resentment towards thinner women. anyway, i pointed out that my sil wasn't making herself sick, but had a condition while pregnant that caused her to be like that (can't think of the name of it). my wife laughed and said she was sure that's what she wanted us to think, and that my sil has always been about her looks, and that she was surprised the baby wasn't scrawny, considering she can't possibly eat enough to be feeding him.

i got really annoyed and said it was my mom and aunt that always made comments, not my sil, and told my wife she didn't have to be so snide. 

my wife went off at me for defending my sil, and starting asking/ accusing me of finding her attractive. i was so blown away by her melt down that i told her i didn't want to talk to her for the rest of the ride home, she took this as me saying i do find my sil attractive, i told her no, that i just don't want to deal with her insecurities right now. 

well, my wife started crying, calling me cruel and  that i don't have to point out the fact that's she's insecure. still annoyed by her accusations, i told her she doesn't have to tear people down to make herself feel better.

when we got home she went straight to bed and i get a lovely explosion of texts from her friends telling me how much of an ass i am.  i know her feelings are hurt but i don't think she has to make comments about others who have done nothing to slight her other then looking the way they do.

edit: i love my wife very much and my attraction to her has never changed,  but, like i said, she has always been like this ever since we were kids. i have made comments however in the past about the way she talks about other people and if she ever wanted to talk to someone about it. she would either  laugh at me and say she has said what needs to be said, or get annoyed.  her mother and sister are actually the same way, but whenever i say anything, they get defensive and say it's just what girls do and that there is no harm to it.

edit: so my wife came home from work and not gonna lie, i thought it would be worse due to the fact that she works with the women who were texting me, and that today would be a bitch fest about me.

we talked and the first thing she asked me was if i find her attractive, i said i always have, however, her attitude is beginning to wear me down and the only thing i want to apologize for is not having a clear conversation about it sooner, that i do stand by what i said, but that i would be there with her to work out why she feels the need to talk about other women so harshly. she got on the defense again, saying that wasn't an apology and that it constantly feels like my sil is trying to show her up whenever they are together.  i pointed out that she was doing it again, and she said it was hard for her to believe i want to support her when i don't have her back. i told her me agreeing with her about her comments isn't supportive, and she needs to understand that what she says isn't okay, and that i will no longer tolerate toxic comments about my family. she started crying again saying that that's how she copes with  sometimes feeling unhappy with herself, that most of what she says has truth and that people like my sil are vein. i recommend we talk to someone about this, she refused. i told her  to take the night to think about what she says, and how she would feel if these things were being said about her, to call me if she needed me, and headed to my mom's house. 

edit: thank you all for the suggestions and support, it sucks to think about how my wife may feel about herself and how many others (myself included ) might have to deal with their insecurities, but i know that her way isn't healthy or going to fix anything, and i wish i had actually addressed it before it came to her bashing my sil for being sick while pregnant. i'm also very sorry for all of you that went or are going through that sickness while pregnant, i only knew very little from my mom about what was happening with my sil, and reading about it on here makes me feel even worse that someone i love could make such crude comments about it.",3

my bf (20m) and i (18f) have been dating for going on a year now. we started out as fwb but then we both developed feelings. in the beginning stage of our relationship he would constantly take me out to dinner and buy me random things he found and thought that i would like (nothing ever expensive just a cute stuffed animal or figurine that he saw for example). at the same point in this relationship i would reciprocate these actions. i would bring him food to work when i went into visit him, i would buy him random presents and would surprise him with random dinners just so he knew that i cared about him.

fast forward a couple months and he's still doing everything listed above just less frequently. he developed financial struggles and eventually quit his job and was unemployed for about a month. during this time he completely stopped spending any money on me and it was entirely me spending money when we went out or did something together. this didn't bother me at all as i understood it was only a temporary situation and i loved him.

he got his job back about three months ago making decent money (we make about the same amount) and i have recently moved about an hour and a half away to go to college so we only see each other every two weeks. 

the problem for me comes in because i am the only one making an effort to drive the hour and a half to either visit home for the weekend or take him up to my dorm. this costs quite a lot in gas. after i make the drive i am the only one who spends money on dates or anything we decide to do when we hang out and he frequently asks me if i can buy him food. his excuse for this is that we always hang out right before he gets paid (he gets paid on monday and we always hang out the weekend before due to work schedules) and at that point all of the money from his paycheck is gone. he never makes any effort to save money even though he knows this is going to happen every time we see each other.

today, he called me and told me that he went out with friends and tipped a waiter $60 because it was ""the best service he had ever received."" i have not said that this hurt me or anything regarding the situation at all because i don't know if i'm being an ass. if i did confront him for this?",3

"the hatred of police on reddit is disgusting.. i see so many people on this site who comment acap or acab on all cop posts. these comments are almost always highly upvoted even though it is completely wrong. there is literally a 0% chance every cop in the u.s. are racist, dog killing bastards like so many people on reddit think they are. i would bet my life that not even 0.5% of cops are like that. i saw a picture on the front page of a cop grieving the loss of his k9 partner. many of the highly upvoted comments were saying that they have no sympathy for the man because they believe that all cops are dog killers. most of the comments arguing with them had many downvotes. the vast majority of cops are good people trying to serve while risking their lives everyday. it is absolutely idiotic to actually hate all cops because of a few stories you see on the news sometimes. it's like thinking all teachers are pedophiles since a few have been caught sleeping with their students.




edit: i didn't make this clear in my post but i'm defending cops as individuals and not the police force as a whole. i wanted to make this post because of the comments on the post of the picture of the cop grieving the life of his k9 partner. many highly upvoted comments said things like they have no sympathy for the man and that he deserves to suffer just because of the fact that he is a cop. i do agree with the people who say there are things wrong with the police force as a whole but i fully disagree with the people who believe that all cops are racist or dog killers or just assholes.

"""snitching"" is a childish concept invented by poorly behaving individuals to make reporting bad behavior a wrong thing to do..

"parents whose children die because of a preventable disease because they chose not to vaccinate should be charged with neglect and 3rd degree murder. title says it all. personally i think that the anti-vaccination movement is absurd and it sickens me that people will voluntarily let their child catch a life threatening disease that could easily have been avoided by getting a vaccination. letting your child die to something preventable because you chose not to do it should be punished severely, and there should be lengthy jail terms and heavy fines to anyone that lets it happen. i know it seems pretty extreme, but it fits right under neglect, and letting someone die because of your actions (not to mention letting a child die) should, in this case, be treated as murder.

edit: i didn't make this clear enough above and i apologize for that but my ""end goal"" with this isn't actually to incarcerate people who have had their child die, but to tack on something more to the threat of what happens as if the movement has existed as long as it has and continues, the children who have died aren't enough to get people to realize what they're doing.

"by taking an uber.. so a college friend recently bought a new place with his wife in his wife's hometown, and invited a bunch of us to spend the weekend. 

i road trip over to suburbia with my buddy, and, through a series of wrong turns and detours, we were last to arrive. we don't stop at the house first, and meet my friends out at a ""main street"" type bar that looked like it was filled with the whole town's drinking age population. 

we booze, chat, and everything is great. as is typical of my friend group, people filter out at different times. everyone is heading back to the couple's house for extended shenanigans. 

i'm many drinks deep at this point and chatting up a few people, so i'm the last to leave. i'm not too concerned, because apparently we're only a few miles away from my buddy's place. i text for the address, order an uber, go outside and wait. it's pouring and at least ten other people are waiting for cars. i see a black camry pull up on my app, see the back camry on the corner, run over and ask the driver if it's my car, hear an inaudible mumble that sounds like yes, decide that's good enough for me, and jump in. we get into a five minute convo about how terrible the weather is while we drive to my friend's house. 

driver stops at a generic suburban house with a long drive way, says this is you, and i get out. it's pouring harder. i run through the rain. see lights on in the house. hear music playing. knock twice to be polite. i expect it to be unlocked, as my friend said they'd leave the door open, so i immediately let myself in. walk down a few flights of steps toward the noise, arrive in what looks like a den, and say hello. 

then the screaming starts. screaming. i'm momentarily confused why there are screams of terror, but then i realize - i have no fucking idea who these people are. 

drunk and confused, i have absolutely no clue what to do. i decide i need to get out and turn around and run outside, to the end of the driveway and stand there, in the rain. i look down at my phone to text my friends, and see i have several missed calls. 

the gears start to turn, but before i could work it out one of the guys who was in the house comes out and starts yelling at me from the end of the long driveway asking what the hell i am doing, and tells me the cops are on their way and he'll kill me if i come any closer. 

simultaneously, another car pulls up, this one with guy in it.  he gets out of the car, surveys the scene, and goes ""dude, i think you got into my uber.""

finally, everything makes sense. now while i'm explaining what happened to the new arrival, so he could tell his friends i'm not a murderer and just a drunk asshole, the cops arrive. 

luckily they got a kick out of it. 

tl;dr i got into the wrong uber, and accidentally walked into a stranger's house, almost got killed and got the cops called on me.  ",4

"ma hoa sued to have us join and lost. now bills us for their legal fees.. we bought a house in 2015 and we made damn sure that it's not part of an hoa. soon after moving in the hoa started sending us documents about joining which we completely ignored. we were even visited once by the president of the hoa and my husband made it clear to him that we have no intention of joining.

in june 2016 we received a letter that said the hoa is considering legal action against us to have us join because by living here we are benefiting from the hoa's work without paying for it and it's a financial burden on everyone other member. the letter insisted that a legal action can be avoided if we agree to join. we ignored it.

the president visited us again in july 2016 and said the same thing, when we pretty much told him ""see you in court"".

they indeed took legal action against us earlier this year and we hired a lawyer and went to the court, their motion was dismissed immediately. we thought it's the end of it. but to make sure we had our lawyer send them a cease and desist letter to stop this constant harassment.

now we received a letter from them, saying we need to reimburse their legal fees of about $3700 according to the article x section y of the hoa's cc&rs with a copy of the cc&rs. the referenced paragraph says something along the lines of ""the association is entitled to recovery of the fees incurred by bringing legal action against the homeowner, as deemed necessary by the board to enforce the cc&rs and preserve the best interests of the community"".

out of the $3700, $2000 is related to their fees for suing us and the remaining $1700 are for the demand letters that they've been sending us during all these times.

i ended up leaving with around cad$3500 more than i came in with. i told my girlfriend and she flat out said i need to give her half because she drove me, and since we've been together for so long, it should be 50/50 split in any case. i wanted to use these to pay off the final remainder of my school loans with some leftover to treat her for a nice dinner and maybe a new piece of furniture.

the short of it is she refused to pick me up and we had a huge fight. it's been a few hours now and it hasn't really calmed down. she's not home (i own the house completely) and won't respond to texts.

on one hand, i feel guilty she got so angry but i also think this is pretty stupid and telling of her character. i think i'm done. i'm not in the wrong, right? we don't share our finances, and in most respects, she's more well off than i. i inherited this house but otherwise work. my girlfriend gets a trust every month and ultimately makes more than i do.

"six lessons of life. **lesson 1:**

a man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. the wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. when she opens the door, there stands bob, the next door neighbour. before she says a word, bob says, ""i'll give you $800 to drop that towel."" after thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of bob.

after a few seconds, bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. the woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. when she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…

""who was that?"" ""it was bob the next door neighbour,"" she replies. ""great!"" the husband says, ""did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?""

this is going to be short, and has been proof read by my lawyer.

the short version is, we were sued. during discovery it was found that the window that was broken was not the ships original window, and it was not even close to spec. if his boat was anything more than amarina queen and fair weather sailer, it could have broken under way under typical use.

he tried to seem ""reasonable"" by accepting he was just as at fault as the rest of us parents, and he'd pay an equal share, which was not the end result.

"kids shirts with political messages are trashy regardless of what it says.. we've all seen those shirts about vaccinations lately. people are critiquing those anti-vax parents for dressing their children in shirts that say ""i'm unvaccinated. my superpower is giving people diseases i don't have"" or something similar. but when we see a shirt of a similar style that's pro-vax (e.g. ""i'm vaccinated because i leave the research to the professionals"") everyone wants one and says they'll get them for their kids. 

i am absolutely for vaccinations, don't get me wrong. i just think using your kid as a pawn to advertise your politics is kinda gross. that child usually isn't old enough to have their own idea about what it says. you are only subjecting that kid to automatic judgement from others based on whether they agree with you, the parent. why not just get cute kids shirts with child-appropriate captions?

"for refusing to meet my dad's new gf, but agreeing to meet my mom's new bf? (age gap weirdness). i am 23/f. my parents \both 47\ divorced 18 years ago. in those 18 years my dad has had a steady flow of *young* girlfriends and fiances moving in with him. i never even got to spend the night with him when i was a kid because there was always some girl living there and there wasn't room for me in his small apartment.

on the polar end of the spectrum is my mom. i do not think she has even been on a date since the divorce, until a few months ago. her whole life revolved around providing for and entertaining me. a few months ago (4ish?) she told me she was seeing somebody named ""scott"" and that it was kind of serious. i have *never* seen my mom look giddy before – it warmed my heart. she then tells me that he is 68 (her dad's age), and to not freak out, but that if i was weirded out, she would call it off. i assured her that while i think it's kind of weird that he is 2 decades older, that i am ecstatic for her. (i am! this woman deserves it.) she cried happy tears, and we agreed that i would meet him soon. 

well, around the same time my mom started dating scott, my dad got a new gf named ""haley."" she has already moved in with him, and i have been refusing to meet her. the reason *why* i don't want to meet her is what makes me an asshole... it's because of her age! she is one year **younger** than me. he is 47, and she is 22. i'm completely grossed out. honestly, it makes me feel like my dad is a huge creep. 

my dad keeps pointing out how i'm a hypocrite because i'll meet my mom's ""creepy boyfriend,"" but not *his* girlfriend. and he will say, ""if you think i'm creepy for dating somebody 20 years younger than me, then why are you okay with scott doing it??"" he made me feel kind of shitty.

i mean, he is right… the age gap is almost the same… but his girlfriend is younger than me. she is 22. scott might be old enough to be my mom's dad… but my mom is almost 50, she's not still in college. and my mom is *far* from naïve. dad's relationship just seems so much ickier to me!! honestly, i'm starting to look back on my dad's relationship patterns and wonder if he's not like a predator or something. but if he is, then is scott too??

i am 100% going to meet scott, and unless y'all convince me otherwise, i am not going to meet haley. (it's nothing against her)

i sat on the table in my t-shirt and shorts and smiled politely as the old man with the stethoscope entered. he bluntly asked ""please, show me your form."" to which i replied by sitting up as straight as i could on the table. he looked at me, and again he said ""miss, i need to see your form."" slightly frustrated, i sat up even straighter. when he again said nothing, i asked ""how do you want to see my form? sitting down? standing?"" 

at this point the doctor is staring at me with a look of mass confusion. he asked me yet again to see my form and in a flustered panic, i took off my shirt and stood there in his office, showing off my perfect form. the doctor proceeded to burst out in laughter and through his cackling squeezed out the words ""your papers! i just wanted to see your papers.""

we were talking today like doing foreplay or whatever trying to turn each other on lol. he started telling me that he wants to go bare and feel me 100% and saying i'd feel him better too. more graphic than that but ya lol. i told him no we can't do that u have to wear one, like always, and he legit started crying. like whimpering and real tears falling from his face. i was like omg are you okay what happened etc. he said he just wants to do it so bad. i comforted him and told him i was getting bc soon and we can do it then but he just sobbed harder and said he couldn't wait that long and said he hates condoms with a passion 

i don't get it. like he actually started crying over this. i just told him it was ok and to calm down and honestly it was kind of a turn off so we didn't even have sex. i love when he's emotional and cries but crying about condoms?? i was pretty confused. does it sound like there's a serious reason for the aversion to condoms or is he just a horn ball and got overly emotional about it. i'm still so confused",7

"update: my wife may be cheating. tl:dr wife wants to divorce if i get the position. she has an answer to everything i saw. i just don't believe her.

i just want to update what has transpired since the post yesterday. shortly after i posted saturday, i finally was able to get her to come out of our bedroom. she had me assure her that i would not yell. i said i just want to talk. so i went over everything i saw. the unmade bed, the dinner the wine, sam leaving right away. she asked what was wrong with any of it? she did not make the bed that day, she was trying out a new recipe, had wine with dinner and finished it after. probably drank too much. sam is a long time bachelor, wife passed away 7 years ago. he stays busy with some of the charities we work with. i just shook my head, i know what i was seeing but she has an explaination for all. i asked why she would not open the door. she started with she was afraid of me. she knows that i have never laid a hand on anyone since the 8th grade. it is not me, i would rather talk things out or seperate until everyone cools down. the other reason was she was not ready to tell me something else.

we have known of the position opening since april. my boss presented to the board his plan to retire end of the year. they want the position filled by 4th qtr. there would be a time when the incoming vp would work along side my boss. my boss has vacation time accumulated so that he won't be working much in december. he gave us the heads up shortly after notifying the board. the wife and i talked about it since then. she has expressed that she did not want to start life over again. she has a nice career, her company does not have a branch back east. she would have to job hunt. i told her she could just not work but feels that she would be unfulfilled. she really thinks i will get the promotion because of my boss. i told her over and over that it is not final until the board votes on a candidate.

so she has decided that she would rather divorce than move. she just wasn't ready for me to come home early. she had not in her mind how to tell me. she knew it would crush me. we have a very solid marriage up to now. we do not put on a show for others since we are in the public so much. sex is still good. has diminished in frequency as we have aged. we both initiate. we are very much each others best friend. she was right. i am crushed. i asked what was her plan if i don't get the job. her answer was that everything stays the same then. i asked her if she was crazy. did she think i would forget? forgive?

i called my lawyer. we are friends also. me calling on the weekend is not an infringment into his personal time. after pleasantries he listen to me until i mentioned potential divorce. he stopped me there. he said ""i can not represent you"". the wife has already hired him. i asked if he new someone else, he said he will send me a list of names from other firms. he told me he personally will not handle the divorce, he will hand it over to another associate in the firm.

i still have an uneasy feeling on what i saw. so i took a couple of commentors suggestion. i called sam. i explained to him very calmly that the wife and i talked. now i want to hear from him. he gave me the same story word for word, like it was rehearsed. then i got hold of the wifes phone. it was scrubbed clean. only messages from saturday night and today. i guess i am getting divorced anyways why should it matter but it does. 

a few years ago i was off work for a couple months due to some medical issues. i had the company install an office in my home. i took one of the kids old rooms and made a home office. i had couple of the it guys come over and get me set up. at the time it was better than my office at work. so i called one if the guys to ask if you can retrieve erased messages and call logs that were deleted from a samsung s10? he said that it was easy, ""goggle it"". i asked him if he could walk me through it. so after a bit we had most of records restored. i searched the phone and found lots of calls to one number, i don't know who, a few months ago. i found sams number lots of calls recently. i checked the texts nothing overly sexual but certainly not charity related, lots of meet up plans. as i am finishing the wife knocks on the door as i locked myself in. she asked if i seen her phone. i opened the door and said "" yeah i have it i fixed it."" she asked what i meant. i told her that i saw her call logs and messages were deleted, so i restored them. her mouth dropped open, she stuttered. then came the obligory ""you went thru my phone?"" she snatched the phone and stormed away. i called after her ""we need to talk some more"". she went out the door and have not seen or heard from her all day.

so monday i need to call the lawyer. i have already been thru bank records . no money has been moved around. i printed balances as of today. i now need to call my kids. i see that she had called each saturday. i think the well has been poisoned. it is starting to set in. she is my life, my partner.  now she will be gone. i feel like when my parents died. how can i go to such a position without her by my side?

edit: through this is all she is maintaining there is no cheating. she keeps saying that it may look like it but she would never do that to me.",7

"by accidentally branding the shape of a penis onto my arm. this didn't happen today but about 3 weeks ago, but the fuck up is just now starting to show itself. the original idea was to brand myself with an arrow, because why not, it'd be badass. so everything is bought; the branding iron, cleaning supplies, and alcohol. i'm obviously not going to stick a hot piece of metal to my arm sober, so i proceed to get shit faced. so after heating it up in the fire and actually going through with it. everything's fine, it looks like and arrow and besides being slightly off center of the lines we drew out it's looking pretty good. we clean it, wrap it up, and head inside to call it a night. now here we are, about 3 weeks later and you can't even see an arrow from the place we stuck the actual brand, but a dick shaped burn all around where it's supposed to be. i'm not sure if the arrow is going to reappear once it starts healing some more, but i really doubt it and i'll probably be stuck with a dick shaped brand on my arm for the rest of my life.

"by creating a fake school note that spread around the school. anonymous account because i don't know who uses reddit at my school. i go to school in america so i know more than one dumb fuck has already done something similar to this at another school. 
this story takes place 3 days ago and i'm still wrapping my head around it. 

okay so my story starts with me browsing r/teenagers one afternoon. one of the posts on the front page was talking about how their friend got suspended for creating a school letter about an up coming ""mandatory penis inspection"" for all students and faculty. now being an immature highschooler, i thought what better idea than to print several copies of the letter template and then customise it to fit my local school. i set to work the night before school creating a customised penis inspection notification letter that i could stick up around the school anonymously in the hopes that the rest of my school would get a good kick out of it.

fast forward to thursday and i had 2 printed out two school letters to place in several of the school restrooms, i strategically placed it on the wall next to the urinal without anyone seeing me enter or leave the restroom. the school bell rings and it's time for the first period of the school day. about halfway through our first lesson, the words ""penis inspection"" had already started floating around the classroom and some pictures of the note were getting shared and reposted on students snapchat stories. fast forward 3 hours to lunchtime and the upcoming penis inspection has become the new hot topic for the students attending my high school. 

naturally it wouldn't take long before a student would take the note and hand it to the principal.
it turns out that my note making skills were so good, that i tricked some students into thinking that it was a real event that was going to happen. the principal now knows about the note along with every student, but no one actually knows who did it. several students were called in to the principal office regarding the photos of the note on their snapchat story because they didn't want it to cause bad publicity. 
so now the principal is on the hunt for whoever created the note, students have begun leaking it outside of snapchat and it's found its way on to several meme pages and the school is threatening legal action regarding the note because it features a government logo on the top of it. i'm pretty worried about someone somehow working out it was me who wrote and stuck up the note, along with the note spreading even more and finding its way onto more meme pages. 

i guess all i can do is wait for monday to come round and hope that photos of the note don't spread any further than they have, and hope that the school doesn't take the note any further than inside of school.

tl:dr i fucked up and anonymously made a ""mandatory penis inspection"" note that i put on the wall of the bathroom. it ended up spreading and the school is threatening legal action against whomst made the note.

"for ""ruining"" an old classmate's coming-out post?. for brief context before i explain what exactly happened here: i'm 27yo gay male and there was a dude in high school, let's call him by his initial b, who loved picking on me for being effeminate.

to be clear, i was never a girly guy on purpose, i just can't exactly change my tone of voice and mannerism that come naturally. b and his friends tormented me verbally so much i developed extreme anxiety whenever i was in their proximity.

they called me every name in the book: fag, sissy, male ugly betty (because i was overweight and pimply back in high school). then, things got 100% worse when we started having pe together. long story short, b and his friends were one of the main reasons i absolutely, positively detested high school.

well now, about a decade later, b came out as bisexual on facebook through a long, public, ""heartbreaking"" essay elaborating his personal struggles. his post popped up on my feed due to a few mutual friends commenting and liking it. ngl, i was pissed off when i read that. not saying people can't change, but since b explicitly said in his post that he knew he was into boys since kindergarten, imo that makes the fact that he tormented me in high school just for appearing gay even worse.

anyway, all of the comments under b's post were overwhelmingly supportive for him ""living his truth"". that just aggravated me to be honest. i'm not sure whether this line of thought makes me bitter or not, but i felt the need to voice my own opinion. so i wrote something along the lines of, ""that's such a cute and manipulative post b, shame you didn't consider any of this stuff when you bullied me in high school for the exact same things you're now embracing."" i wanted people to see that he's not some sort of a blameless victim of a prejudiced society, as he tried to portray himself in the coming-out post.

most of our classmates and others attacked me though, saying stuff like ""why rain on a fellow lgbt person's parade?"" and repeating all the generic stuff about people growing up, changing, finding themselves etc. one of my high school classmates even pm'd me to say, you don't even know what b went through since high school, he doesn't need your negativity, you're being petty and holding a grudge.

am i honestly the asshole here? i sure feel like one now, but i still don't *believe* i am in the wrong for criticizing someone who made my high school experience miserable and caused my anxiety.",3

"i (27m) am leaving my gf (25f) because she's been trying to have an affair. this is hard. we've been together for nearly 8 years. we built a life together. 

so, there's so much to this but basically i did that thing that everyone in a relationship should be wary of. i looked through her phone. and i found messages upon messages from a mutual friend who lives out of state now that were concerning. initially i was gonna leave right then and there but i wanted to try to talk to her. so i gave her almost 3 chances to own up to it. the first time i was really vague and just asked if there was someone else. she flat out denied. i thought i was prepared for her to deny but turns out i wasn't. then the other times i got more and more pointed. finally she admitted that the guy had messaged her and flirted with her but we knew he was that way and while she didn't tell him to ""fuck off"" she wasn't into it. 

now i didn't see any messages from her at the beginning that showed she was exactly complicit in it. so while i didn't believe her i tried to give her a chance. i know it's stupid but we've been together for so long and we built a life together.

but then i dug again. and there it was. all of it. and worst she took the time to insult me to him. that hurts. so fucking much that hurts. i know my faults and i know what i could've worked on in this relationship but i really tried. everyday i tried. but for her to tell someone else things about me like that, i can't help but feel broken. 

so, right now i'm waiting for her to wake up and leave for work. then i'm packing what i can and heading to a friends place and....i don't know. i spent 8 years on this relationship and i'm gonna walk away from it. 

i wrote a note out on my phone that i'm gonna write up for her after she leaves. it says everything i can think to say. i mulled over what to say nonstop. somewhat satisfyingly i'm gonna tell her how she did this. to know that and remember that. and that if at any point she thinks we can ok that she fucked this and hurt me so much. 

i'm scared i'm lost and so much so i don't want to have to do this. 

but i have to and i know ultimately it's going to get better. but also fuck all of this. 

edit 1: she's up now and getting ready for work. she tried to kiss me and apologized about tossing and turning all night and she knew it kept me up. 

i seem to be getting a lot of push back on the letter. when she leaves i'm gonna pack and i'll mull it over again. but i'll say this, if i decide to write and it ends up being a mistake then so be it. it felt nice to at least draft it out on my phone. made things more real so i can convince myself more that i have to leave. 

edit 2 (8:30 am) she just left for work. i'm going to shower and truthfully let out a nice cry. then pack my stuff. lots of people are saying to straight ghost her and lots are saying a short and to the point note instead of letter. i'm gonna contemplate that in the shower. 

she kept saying ""i love you"" and i was reluctant to say it back. she said it 3 times and i kind of grumbled it out once. i'm certain once she reaches work she'll text me about that. 

i'm not going to respond to her while she's at work. she won't be home till probably 8 tonight. 

i just realized i should time stamp the edits maybe(?) i don't know 

edit 3 (8:54) i'm packing up now. cats seem to know something is up because they won't leave me alone. honestly breaks my heart. 

i've been mulling the letter over. i reread it a few times. and i've decided on a short note just laying out that i know and i'm leaving. essentially something like: 

""i left. i know about you and him insert what i read and saw. i'm so utterly disappointed in you. i won't be answering my phone and i wish for you not to contact me. at some point we'll get together to discuss logistics.""

also, i am reading everyone's comments. if i didn't reply i'm sorry. to the people that have commented about going through something similar, i am so so sorry you're going through this as well. i don't know what you'll be able to gleam from my situation but i hope something here in all of this helps y'all as well. 

edit 4 (9:25 am) i'm pretty much packed with what i can get out right now. obviously there's a lot more. i'm writing the note and then leaving. i'll need to find food after i drop off what i have. this may be the last update since she won't be off till later tonight. but i'll respond to y'all when i can. gives me something to do. 

edit 5 (10:42 am) i'm at my friends place. she's giving me the lay of the land. people have been talking about taking the cat. currently that's not an option. friend has 3 and a dog. my cats are spoiled and hate anyone that isn't her and i. i'm not worried she'd do anything to them. if anything she's gonna want them around if she does get upset. not that she deserves that but it is what it is 

thank you everyone for the kind words and the advice. i'll respond to some of you again here soon. 

someone asked me about my work. i work in equine care. it's actually really cool, i love my job and i love being there. so once i start going back in a few days it'll be a really good distraction. 

in a bit i'm going to get food and maybe walk around downtown and goof off. 

also, my friend reminded me she's going out of town next week for a week. so i'll have the place to myself. i don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. but hey she'll have someone to watch her animals while she's gone so there's that. 

i know i have a lot of figuring out to do. but i literally just left. 

oh, and someone else mentioned they hope i find things to do to make myself happy. i had plans before all of this to go to ""the usual"" brewery with some friends tomorrow. initially i was gonna call some of them and tell what's going on and i need space but thinking about it more it actually sounds like the perfect distraction.  

edit 6 (1:45) got food (banh mi and a mai tai if anyone was curious) and talked to a couple of friends. so i'm sorry i haven't been replying. it's gonna take a while to go through all the messages and comments but what i've seen so far i want to say for the umpteenth time thank you y'all. 

edit 7 2:15 - okay, this is my last update. apparently i used a word that altright folks like to use but it was used to describe me so whatever. 

i'm still trying to go through all the comments but i saw some people had questions i'll do my best to address. 

the friend is...well a friend. i don't know what else to say on that. there's nothing there. a guy and a girl can be friends and that's it. if this is weird for you guys then i'm sorry? i mean i don't know if this is gonna be a straight move in. i'm still figuring things out. 

some people have said i'm no better than her and 8 years and not being married was already a bad sign and etc. well, i guess so? like clearly this relationship isn't working out. look what it lead to. if that's my fault or her fault or or fault or whatever it is the situation i'm in. 

and on the note of what it lead to, a lot of people asked me what exactly was said or done. i realize i kept it vague and i supposed it was cause i felt weird typing it out. but i don't mind telling you guys what i can. 

as far as i know she hasn't actually ""cheated"" ie fucked him. they messaged flirtatious things (calling eachother hot sexy etc) and their some pictures but no nudes. but the recent thing i found (and i'll touch on the going through the phone thing next) it was messages about wanting to fuck eachother. straight up. that they missed a chance because of me. but, and this for me is the kicker, he apparently wants to make a this is where that word was used of me. and she seemed into it. they wanted to have sex and have me know they did. which is why i don't think they have yet. 

on the going through the phone thing, i know it was dumb. i know what i did. i don't advocate. but it is how i found about all of this. i just had suspicions that something was going on with someone. so it did that for me. would i tell the next person to go through their partners phone? i don't know. probably not. i'd tell them if they find something it'll hurt cause this fucking hurts. and if they don't then they breached the trust and privacy of their so for nothing and that in it of itself is a weird situation. 

i don't know folks. does that help anyone? should i elaborate more? ",7

"for not deleting nude photos of a girl i legally own the rights to until she paid me back for all the rent she was supposed to pay.. to sum up the entire story as quickly as possible. i worked for a photography company for a while. during this time i met a girl (we'll call b) and we started dating.

b and i took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. she paid me for these photos and signed the rights to me. eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. 

however she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and i had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. leaving me with almost too much to pay.

she left and i continue paying as i did not want to get kicked out. after the year long lease ends, i move elsewhere.

two years later b messages me out of the blue, demanding i delete all the photos i took of her. normally i would but not after how she did me. so i told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. 


she then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  i already gave them to the local law enforcement).

i basically say it since she was acting like that, i would give her an ultimatum. if she really wanted the photos gone, i wanted every cent she told me in rent. and i said that if she accused me of being abusive, i would post her messages and sue her for slander.

never heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from b. true to my word i deleted the photos in front of her and she told b.

"over 50% of millenials have less than $1,000 saved.. according to a google consumer survey, over 50% of millenials have less than $1,000 in savings.

http://howmuch.net/articles/how-much-millennials-have-saved-up

the article has several nice graphics an includes the following breakdown:

* 51.8% of millenials have less than $1,000 in savings.

* 18% have $1,000 - $5,000 in savings.

* 7.3% have $5,000 - $10,000 in savings.

* 6.4% have $10,000 - $20,000 in savings.

* 16.5% of millenials have more than $20,000 in savings.

there's further breakdowns by income group and gender.

this seems consistent with other surveys that indicate americans don't save well, and for this particular age group the great recession probably has a lot to do with it.  the breakdown by gender was interesting to me - i wonder if it's an indication that wage inequality is not improving with the younger generation.  i was also quite surprised at the distribution by age group - i expected a successively smaller percentage of those surveyed to have more in savings, with the smallest percentage being for the ""over $20,000"" category, which is not the case.

the survey methodology is here(https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=sw3gyf6eo4s3k&question=1&filter=inc%3a%2425%2c000-%2449%2c999&rw=1) and the article asserts:

"a girl (18f) that i (17m) hooked up with took photos of my penis while i was sleeping and sent it to a group chat of her friends. hi everyone. i am a 17 year old guy who is kinda seeing/hooking up with a girl from the hs we both graduated from.

a few nights ago i slept at her house cause her parents were away and we had sex for the first time. 

when we were sleeping she took a picture of my penis. i was actually just sleeping naked as was she. i only now realize it cause i saw the flash go off and heard the phone camera sound.

i didn't think much of it and i was also more than half asleep.

fast forwards to a few mins ago my best friend texts me that there are dick pics going around of me and then compliments me like i'm ""the man"" or something meanwhile i'm freaking out. it's like he texted me not to warn me but to congratulate me!

anyway i put two and two together and realize that she took the picture and sent it around.

so i called her out on it and at first she denied it but then i caught her in a lie and she admitted to taking the pictures and sending them to a group chat of 5 of her girlfriends (and their one gay male friend).

i feel so violated and pissed and whenever i try to explain to someone that i'm mad and i feel this is wrong, they try to talk me into thinking that this is a good thing because ""it means i got laid and it means my dick is getting ""exposure"" so that's a good thing""?!?!

the girl fees no remorse and when i said i wanted her to delete them she said ""fuck no lmao don't be a pussy"". and then she invited me to come over and ""fuck her again lmao"" but i don't wanna go now.

i forgot to mention i was always self conscience about my penis cause it's on the small side (like no more than 5"" on a good day). so in my head i'm thinking that everyone is probably making fun of how small it is.

i know that sending nudes without permission is not cool and starting to become a real concern when it happens to people but the reactions i'm getting ppl are saying i gotta be proud and stop complaining.

please can anyone help with advice.",7
"for telling my friend that if she kept up her ""no filter"" persona, we'd stop inviting her to hang out?. my friend, we'll call her bridget, is one of those ""not like other girls"" people. she makes those posts on facebook, talks about it, etc. it can get a bit annoying, but the biggest issue i have with it, is that she ""has no filter"". now, i'm all for speaking your mind because free speech and all of that. but there are times when you need to have a filter. she's the type to point out when things are awkward between two people, but they're pretending to be civil for the sake of the group and just get through this outing, before they don't have to see each other again. doesn't happen often, but it's happened a couple of times when people have had an argument or don't like each other and then things are even more awkward.

if someone is on their phone a bit, she'll wave her hand in front of their face and say ""hey there"" and then call them on it. if they have a fashion sense that's odd to her, she'll make fun of them, even if they ask her to stop. she'll also tell you really random, graphic stories about her past, the same ones over and over. it's sad the first time, but your cocktail anecdote should not be ""my house burned down when i was 11 and my uncles died two days apart, plus i think they haunt me."" (the uncles didn't die related to the fire, they died of terrible diseases and these are tragic stories, and i'm sorry they happened, btw, i'm not trying to make light of it.) it makes people feel awkward, which you guess it…she calls them on and laughs about.

if you call her out on any of this, ""i have no filter"". a lot of our friends don't like this, but a bulk of them (including myself for a bit until she did this with me for way to long about the clothes) chalk it up to ""that's just bridget"".

the other night, we were all hanging out and one of the guys had brought his new girlfriend. we were all talking about fairly, light, funny topics. suddenly, bridget brings up her uncles and started talking about their sickness, in excruciating detail. i can tell that the new girlfriend was getting pretty weirded out and i told her ""hey, maybe we can talk about the time they took you fishing. that's a funny one."" 

but no, she continued until she was done. then the room got quiet, as it always does after she tells this horrible, awful story about two men dying of cancer and she looks around, bursts into laughter and goes ""well, now none of you have anything to say.""

our friend's new girl looks humiliated and i just feel so bad for her. i say, ""bridget, you need to cut this out. if you keep this up, people are going to stop inviting you to hang out with us. no one likes the way you talk to them. we've told you in the past."" she looked incredibly hurt and i said ""sorry, i don't have a filter.""

apparently, bridget is still incredibly hurt and thinks i'm an ass. i do feel a bit bad, but at the same time, i am just sick of how she treats us as a group. am i being an ass here?",3
"my boyfriend (21m) is well-off and travelling, while i'm (20f) broke, stuck in shit conditions and struggling to put food on my plate. it's making me feel pathetic and worthless, and it's getting increasingly difficult to be happy for him. help?. we've been together for a year, been best friends for 3 years before that. my boyfriend comes from a wealthy family while mine has always been quite poor. i love him and care about him a lot and i have never been jealous of his wealth, i've always paid for my own things and haven't/don't expect him to pay for me.

however recently things have been especially tough for me, i live alone as i have no other options and am a student, due to certain circumstances (sick family member, debt and a few other things) life has been extremely difficult for me recently. i work when i'm not studying and come home late in the night, then rush to college in the morning, rince and repeat. almost everything i earn goes to pay the rent and internet (which i need for college). most of the days i have nothing to eat, and it won't be an exaggeration to say i mostly survive on bread, eggs and ramen noodles. i'm extremely tired, depressed and constantly have suicidal thoughts.

my boyfriend left 2 months ago to travel the eu and take language courses. he constantly sends me pictures of the things he's up to, cliche pics of expensive food, hotels, pools etc. i've always been very excited and happy for him when he's having a good time, but at the moment it's become too much to handle. i know it will probably sound shallow but i don't want to see pictures of him having steak with red wine and everything when my best meal in the last 6 months has been a chicken pie and most of the days i'm just starving.

he knows of my current situation and while i know he isn't trying to mock me, it often feels like it. it's like he's rubbing it in my face, although he isn't doing that deliberately. it still makes me angry at him. i can't keep up a conversation with him anymore because he always disappears mid-conversation and then comes back with a pic of him at a party or something titled ""sorry was afk"", and then disappears again. he makes me feel even more lonely than i already am. i love him but i'm constantly so mad and upset with him. it just hurts so much. i'm miserable and have no idea what to do. i'm losing the only friend and a person that loves me over these feelings and i don't know how to stop them.

"refusing to consider fat people when dating is not, nor will it ever be ""shallow"".. often you'll hear fat people (usually women) complaining about how shallow everyone else is who refuses to date them or even find them physically attractive, based on their weight. the general argument tends to go along the lines of ""you should love a person for who they are on the inside, and not what they look like on the outside"". 

however, what many of them don't seem to realise is that by refusing to date them, it's about more than just their appearance - it's about their personalities and their lifestyles. being fat is more often than not, a result of having a lack of self control. yes, chances are they do care about their overall health and appearance, but usually not enough to willingly do something about it. 

things like hiking, walking the dogs, or even spending a lot of time on your feet while travelling will be too much for them to handle, and they'll slow you down like all hell. unless you each prepare your own meals, eating healthily goes out the window also, whether due to an increase in the amount of junkfood and takeaways being consumed, or even just home-cooked meals that are high in calories. 

between the lack of exercise and increased caloric intake, chances are that you too, will also gain weight over time. you're potentially looking at a significantly shorter lifespan for not only yourself, but even possibly your future children, who will likely follow in the footsteps of their parents. 

wanting the best for yourself, your partner and your children is not ""shallow"". expecting a healthy person to push all of that aside to accommodate for your size on the other hand, it kind of is.",6
"my (23f) bf (25m) wants to go on an annual ""gaycation"" where he ""becomes gay for a week"" ? is this normal?. me and my boyfriend have been dating for 1 year, but recently he suggested something that astonished and confused me. 

he wants to go on a 1 week ""gaycation"" with his best friend later this year, and he wants to make an annual thing.  i had never heard of this but he tells me it is when straight guys go on a trip and become gay for the duration of that trip, and are straight again when they come back. 

he says that during this trip he and his friend would basically look for other guys to have sex with, but that it ""wouldn't count"" because it would not be emotional, just physical, and that ""what happens on a gaycation doesn't count in the real world anyways."" 

naturally i asked my boyfriend if he was gay or maybe a bisexual, but he acted offended when i said this and said it was just an annual 1 week ""bit of fun"" and that there was nothing gay about it, especially since it was only for 1 week a year. 

i don't know how to feel about this and it has caused quite a bit of argument with us. he insists it is normal and a lot of straight guys do it. this is my first serious boyfriend and aside from this one new issue everything has been great. 

is it normal for straight guys to pretend to be gay for a week, and am i overreacting? should i try to make a compromise? i'm very confused by this.

"my friend had $1000 stolen from his account with chase and the bank is refusing to help, even going as far as to send a new card to the person who stole the money over a thousand miles away.. * according to my friend, in the middle of january he got a google security alert that someone attempted to login to his email. he ignored the email (a mistake). 

* a couple days later, he got an automatic notification that someone tried to spend $700 with his card, and the notification asked my friend if he made this transaction or not. my friend answers no, and it is declined. 

* my friend, freaked out by the notification, checks his bank, and sees a statement showing $1000 was withdrawn a couple days ago.

* my friend immediately calls chase, telling them he did not make any of those transactions and that his cards need to be cancelled because his account is compromised. they ask for his address (we live in texas) and then tell him the charges will be reversed.

* a few days later, my friend checks his account and sees that the charges were reversed only temporarily, and he ended up still having the charges.

* my friend checks his email again which has since been filled with spam and there was a request the day *before* he got the original alert for a new card. he changed the password and added 2fa so as to secure the email. my friend also checked the locations where his email was signed into and there was one in florida.

* my friend waits an additional 2 weeks believing that the issue is already resolved since he called the bank and let them know those transactions weren't him as well as requesting a card to his address which they asked him for. 

* he never got a card, so he goes to a local branch and is told that the new card was sent to florida to the thief.

since then my friend has tried contacting chase over the phone multiple times and they have been extremely reluctant to help, and have asked him for proof that he was in texas on the day of the transactions. they also gave him a deadline of 2 weeks before they will close the case and refuse to help.

i need to enroll in community college. i tried applying to my local college online? but i'm not sure if i have classes or not as i haven't received an acceptance email. the application also asked for two $25 fees but it didn't give me an option to pay for it after i put in my fafsa information. i'm so confused i think i got rejected because my 2.4gpa is too low, it really sucks because i wanted to take some of their art classes as i've been told my art is decent(http://orig07.deviantart.net/090a/f/2017/107/7/7/together_by_rouzani-db67snx.png). i don't have a phone because i'm trying to save money otherwise i would call. i don't know what to do.

hi all,

thanks for most people's perspectives. i figured it didn't make sense to wait, so i called up my brother in law (i.e. wife's sister's hubby) to chat. my wife and her sister and absolute best friends in the world, so i thought bil might have some insight. my wife has been talking to and spending time with her sister a lot recently, which is not uncommon, but it seemed a bit out of the ordinary.

my bil said that my sil has been pretty depressed and sad/jealous since my wedding. she's said some things like ""now the perfect couple can have the perfect life"" (directed at us) and saying things like ""50% of marriages end up in divorce, i wonder who we know will be first"" (directed at no one in particular). they also went out shopping, and the thong purchases were from that trip. my bil has talked to my sil about the jealousy and sadness, and i guess she is exploring some therapy options. sil has been in a horrible job situation recently as well.

i have always loved my sil, but i know she had some relationship trust issues in the past and i think she might be (accidentally or on purpose, i don't really know) planting some seeds in my wife's mind about being hesitant to settle down (but after 7 years? weird...).

after talking to bil, i brought it back up with my wife very gently. she did tell me that sil told her things like ""you know, after marriage you need to keep your game up - what if he leaves? you'd have nothing."" that type of thing. my wife said she just mostly ignored these things but can now see that her personality might have been starting to change. she stayed with her sister for a while when i was working out of state, and she said they read of lot of cosmo type stuff (which my wife is not usually a fan of) and went shopping where my sil bought my wife some new sexier dresses.

it's a tough situation because i honestly thing my wife loves my sil just as much as she loves me, so it must be a bit confusing. at least i got my wife to admit something might be changing, and i am almost certain i know the source now. i think we're in the clear - my wife and i have dealt with some strife in our relationship early on because of her sister, so this is something we can deal with!

"by taking a nude photo on my wife's phone. so my wife left her phone in the bathroom a few days ago and i saw it as i got out of the shower, so i did what any dumbass husband would do, i took ridiculously cheesy nude photos of myself around the house. nothing sexual or anything. just things like me eating cereal with my diving hood(https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/diveshop/images/ndiver/ndiver_arctic_supervent_hood.jpg)  on and legs spread eagle for no reason, or me watering the plants willst my legs were unnecessarily too far apart and so on. 

we don't really go out much and we have no friends in this country (we just moved), so i thought she'd find it really funny when she came home. 

well, i went to work and forgot all about it completely. fast forward to today. we're at h&m and trying to pay. my wife uses this member thing (i don't really know exactly what it is. i guess you could be an h&m member or something) that's on an app on her phone and for some reason, the barcode just won't scan! 2 people at the counter are trying everything possible. no luck. my wife gets the clever idea that maybe she should take a screenshot of the barcode, zoom in and enlarge it. maybe it will work then. 

by this point, there's a bit of a queue behind us, and the 2nd cashier has to give up and start getting this under control. he's ringing up the lady next to us. her kid's basically watching our cashier basically frantically try to find some sort of solution whilst staring at my wife's screen, and when my wife opens her photos, well,  20 incredibly unflattering naked photos of myself popped up, the cashier gasps loudly says ""oh my god!"", and this little fucking kid shouts ""he is naked mommy! that man is naked!!!"" my wife's a fucking tomato , a group of teenage girls behind us burst out laughing at the whole situation and my pits began sweating in ways i never knew my body was capable of. 

anyway, my wife didn't find those pictures as funny as she would've at home*, i scarred a child and won't ever be going back to that particular branch ever again. 

i should be asleep, but i keep thinking about this and audibly groaning. probably the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me. 

oh and we couldn't find a solution about the app thing. she told my wife to do something online, but i was so embarrassed my brain shut off. 

**tl;dr: my wife unwittingly unleashed my unflattering nudes on a child and our cashier at an h&m.**

* as i was typing this post, she's laughing her ass off at the photos now, 12 hours later.

edit: no idea why i titled it as if it were only 1 photo.

edit2: woah good morning. thanks for the gold and silver. what a weird thing to wake up to. i don't know what i'm supposed to do with this. 

also, for those of you asking how everyone saw the pictures, only 3 people did (4 if you include myself). my wife, the kid and the cashier. the other reactions were from the extreme reactions of the kid and cashier. 

the counter was shaped sort of like this 

|____|. 

the computer screen was on the higher part, the the section where you hand over the stuff you want to buy goes on the lower bit. it was slightly below waist high and about 3-4foot(1m) deep. 

the kid's head just about got past the counter and if he was stood on tippy toes, the counter would've been about collarbone high for him. my wife was leaning on the counter with her phone angled towards her, so the kid could clearly see the phone and he was barely 2 feet away from it and the cashier was stood over it so it was easily visible to her as well. 

while i'm clarifying things, i don't really know how many photos it takes for an iphone se's screen to be entirely filled when you first open the photos app, i took 2 more than that number. i never actually counted them, so they could've been more than 20 or maybe even less. 

hope that clarifies it.

we did try brightening and dimming the screens. one of the cashiers even wiped the phone with windex to try to rule that out as well lol

"dinner. so i'm up here in new hampshire on a project for work.  i get a daily per diem for food.  i usually spend my first day food per diem on grocery store items; just stock the room up with some food for the rest of the week and crash.  the remaining day's allowances get spent going out to eat.  i did buy a little food in the airport that day, but planned to spend the rest in the grocery store.

so the fuck up.  i just got a hankering for good ham sandwiches.  totally random, right?  but ham sandwiches can be the shit sometimes.  i grabbed some cherry coke zero for the fridge and some beef jerky for a snack.  the beef jerky is like 10 bucks and i only have about $20 remaining for the day.  eh, work is paying for it, so who cares and sandwiches are cheap.  surely i can do ham sandwiches on 10 dollars, right?  wally world bread is only a buck.  i did get some of those zesty/spicy bread and butter pickles because those are also the shit.  cheap store brand mustard.  i'm sure i can do this.  i hit the check out counter and my total is $19.76.  fuck yea, self!  you did awesome.

now it's almost midnight and i need to hit the hotel before they think i'm not going to show up or something.  i don't know if they actually cancel you for showing up after midnight, but i headed out, got checked into my room, start putting all my shit away.  pickles in the fridge, bread on top of the fridge, mustard in the fridge, cokes in the fridge, and... fuck.  wtf?  i've got all the stuff for ham sandwiches except for ham.  how the hell did i forget ham?  i've ruined everything.  meh


tl;dr  forgot to buy ham for my ham sandwiches.  sorry that was a boring story that didn't end with my dick in the bread or a sandwich stuffed up someone's ass.",4
"for not wanting my husband's best friend over every week.. my husband and i just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every wednesday is (again) staying the night. 

my husband and this friend have had a wednesday night ""date"" where the guy comes over to our house to ""jam"" every week for the last two years, and i'm getting to the point that i want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. 

buckle up. this is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. 

at first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while i was at work. over time i have stopped working late wednesday's but the jam session continues. which was fine. however, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). neither my husband or i get high with him (i don't enjoy pot and my husband isn't much into it either, but we aren't morally against it so we didn't say anything early on when we should have). 

now that he is always high here, he never leaves at the end of the night. just expects to sleep over. but he doesn't have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. this always wakes me up and i have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. at these points he always has demands. like: ""i want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. find it for me."" or ""you need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and i can't stand the smell."" he always says he'll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn't sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. at which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. what's supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. 

on top of never leaving, he has started showing up hours before my husband gets off work on wednesday's. my husband has told him ""my home is your home"" so he just comes right in. this wouldn't be a problem if he could self entertain. but no. he comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where i'm hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever i'm doing/watching on tv. 

every time he is here he eats a lot of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. he just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. 

my husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. 

dealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. he farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. whenever. is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. saying things like ""dude! you actually made your house look sorta nice this week."" (as i was prepping for christmas), and ""so you do sometimes make an effort on your looks"" (when i had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). he also complains non stop about the food i make (yet eats it all anyway). 

this year for my birthday we couldn't afford to get any gifts, so i asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. que two full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband's time. i spent ""our time"" and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. 

then, christmas comes. i had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time i got to see my parents on christmas in more than ten years. this guy's mom had just moved to another state but this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for christmas. but he didn't. then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a ""woe is me, i'm all alone one christmas eve, no one loves me"" tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. he shows up. gets high. and is a complete ass to everyone. then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this huge stinky fart right at the table like it's nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. my family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn't wait to leave. he stayed for three days. 

i feel like an ass hole because he is my husband's best friend and i don't want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn't done anything truly terrible. he's just annoying as shit. i fucking dread every wednesday, and then i'm super irritated the whole time he's here. which i hide from him, at my husband's request, but then my husband and i always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. 

i'm honestly one or two wednesday's away from homicide with this guy, and all this i've told you is just the tip of the iceberg. 

if you've made it this far, please tell me for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? 



tl;dr my husband's best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. for not wanting him to come over for a long time? 








thank you all for your overwhelming response!! i haven't been able to reply to all of you, but i want you to know i've read every post and i appreciate all of your opinions (even the ones calling me a shrew) and your great advice! 

some clarification and an update: in case you weren't already sick of reading all this >< 


clarification 1: as some have pointed out, there isn't much of an action here for me to ask about. i'm sorry i didn't make it clearer originally. the question is am i unreasonable and being an ass hole for wanting a break from having this friend over. my husband and i fought over this last night and he feels i'm being overly upset and needlessly irritable at said friend. you've already read how i feel about it. 


clarification 2: this post, admittedly doesn't give much positive about the friend. his friend has been in my husband's life since he was in grade school, and while the friend is over they do actively chat, watch movies, and generally hang out while i actively hide and feel irritated. all this stuff for sure could look like an exaggeration if it all happened in the last few days, but this is sorta my laundry list of the last two years of grievances which have been building up over time. on a regular wednesday he is just stoned, flatulent, and childish, which while annoying, isn't really actively douchy. he has done some very nice things for my husband, such as paying to take him to some very expensive concerts so that they could both nerd out over their favorite guitar players live. i -clearly- don't like the guy, but my husband gets a lot of enjoyment out of their friendship and i'm not saying that has to stop. just that -i- need a break. also, my husband does have other friends, they just have lives so he only gets to hang out once every few months with them. he is also in a band with other friends whom he sees regularly every monday night. 

clarification 3: my husband doesn't see a problem with how he speaks to me because according to him ""the guy just has poor social skills, that comment about your makeup was a compliment.""

clarification 4: he smokes a vape style pot pen, not a physical bud, which has less residual scent and is why my husband told him he could do it in the house. before he started using i was ok with him. he still had poor manners, but he wasn't nearly as bad as he is now, and he never spent the night (or longer). back before the pot i even enjoyed hanging out with the two of them every so often. oh and i know my husband occasionally also imbibes with him, which isn't something that makes me mad. he doesn't go overboard like his friend. 

update: when i woke up this morning i noticed that my phone was buzzing…. and buzzing…. and buzzing…. as all these awesome comments kept pouring in. i have never really had much success on reddit, so when i looked and saw how many comments there were i said ""oh my god!"" of course my husband asked what was wrong and i said ""i told the internet the story of ***** and asked if i was the ass hole for what we fought over last night."" he said..""oh"" and that was it. but then on his way out of the bedroom he said ""i'm going to get him up"", and by the time i was dressed and out of the room they guy was out of the house and driving away. hallelujah!!! 

forty minutes later when he got to work i received a text message telling me how i was his best friend and that he loves me more than the world ect. then we texted back and forth and he said ""i really feel like we both contribute to it. i feel like you are overly grumpy on things pertaining to *****. but at the same time, i invite him to come up extra days, or stay the night without running it by you. i feel we could both do better and relieve a lot of stress and frustration. do you agree?""  

he then called a few minutes later and i told him that i know i'm grumpy but i feel like it's reasonably so. i also told him i didn't want to force them not to be friends just that -i- needed a break from the friend. then i gave him some possible solutions such as hanging out at his house every other week, or have a set time that the guy needs to stop smoking in order to drive home later (thanks guys! great suggestions!) and he agreed to consider other arrangements with the hang out time so that i could have some time away from the friend, and we agreed to talk more about it when he is off work tonight. although i can tell he still isn't seeing a problem other than my attitude : / 

again thank you to everyone who has commented!

"by ejaculating on my bathroom floor. throwaway because a few of my friends follow my main account.

okay so this happened just a few minutes ago and im hiding in the same bathroom as i type this. these last few weeks have been really hectic because of my 2 hour daily commute to college, my driving classes, supplementary classes and gymming. being a stressed horny 18 year old dude who hasnt touched his willy since last year, ive been as pent up as a sex addict on solitary confinement. mom and dad decide to go shopping and i decide this is the moment i get some relief. as soon as they leave i get in the bathroom(its easier to clean later on) with my tissues and get to work on my little one. im done in about 5 minutes(dont judge i was really backed up) and am relaxing in the afterglow of that sweet sweet  oxytocin when the bell rings again. mind you my mom and dad take around 2 hours for shopping on a typical weekend. panicking, i drop the jizz filled tissue on the floor, pick it up again and throw it in the bin and leave to open the door. its important to note that we live as tenants and our lease is almost due.
to my horror its the broker, new tenants and mom on the door. i let em all in and the broker starts showing around the house to the new tenants. they eventually get to the bathroom and the new tenant(a 30 something bahemoth of a man) enters while looking around. when the tissues had fallen down earlier, some of my man seed had fallen down on the floor. the new tenant enters the bathroom ,slips on my fresh jizz and falls down with a huge thud. the broker and my mom come running tpwards the bathroom while the new tenant is holwing in pain, saying its really slippery in here. my mom counters by saying that we keep our bathroom meticulously clean and so the broker goes to inspect the slipperyness, accidentally touches my semen with his foot, visibly recoils and looks back at me with a disgust filled eyes. my mom is perplexed but the broker silently ushers the cursing new tenant out shortly after. my mom comes to inspect the bathroom after they leave, but i enter first telling her i want to take a dump. now im in the bathroom cleaning jizz of the floor while my mom waits outside the door.
oh,btw the broker lives really close by and knows everyone in my area by name. im pretty sure wierd rumours are gonna fly around for a while.

tldr; ejaculated on the bathroom floor,new tenant slips on my cum and falls down while the broker who eveyone in my area knows sees my jizz on the floor.

"for demolishing a public park?. i bought some land including a house on a corner lot across from a school. there's a ""public"" park on the property which i also inherited. as far as i'm aware, this park has been open to the public for a couple of decades. i'm not super familiar as i'm relatively new to this town. it's one of three parks and obviously it's heavily used due to the closeness of an elementary school.

my lawyer says it's an ""easement"" meaning the public is free to use it out of habit/tradition yet it remains my responsibility. i guess the prior owner maintained it with some help from the town through the mayor's office and volunteers. the prior owner was a developer/philanthropist who did a lot of the small town.

i don't like this because it opens me up to liability. i've asked the mayor's office if they'd like to hire surveyors to redraw property lines and consider it public property rather than my property, for free no less, and they've refused. they don't want the liability or the cost of hiring workers and lawyers to make it happen.

putting up signage or fences haven't really worked so i want to uproot it all and just make it lawn. before this, when i had signage up, some of the parents of students at the school started a petition to ""save their park"", not knowing it's privately owned and not part of the town's public spaces. trying to reason with some of them fell on deaf ears.

would i be the asshole? still working it out legally with my lawyer else i'd have posted this on /r/legaladvice. i'm looking for moral/ethical opinions on whether i should or not. i just don't want a kid to get hurt, parents go to the mayor, mayor sends them to me.",3
"my 34m wife 28f wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend. when my wife and i met, she had broken up with her boyfriend almost a year prior. we went on a couple of dates until i noticed she slowly stopped talking to me. i found out she had gotten back with her boyfriend. we remained friendly since we would run into each other at the gym (that's how we met). a year later, they break up. i decided to go for it again and asked her out. she was pretty upfront about him and i learned that they have been off-and-on for almost four years. she left him because he started to get abusive.

we get married a little over a year later. a few months later, she gets pregnant.

last week, i was sitting in the kitchen studying until i heard my wife yell out, crying. i ran over to her to ask her what was wrong. she had difficulty speaking, but, she eventually showed me a post on facebook that a mutual friend between her and her ex had posted. her ex had gotten into a motorcycle accident and had died.

my wife was/is an avid motorcyclist who stopped riding once she got pregnant. she knew how passionate he was about motorcycle riding just as much as her and how tragic it is.

i console my wife and help her get to bed, letting her know that i'm here for her.

i didn't think much about the whole thing until my wife told me last night that she wants to name our baby after him. i hesitated for a bit and told her that i feel uncomfortable with it. for one, it's her ex. second, he was abusive. why would she want to honor someone like that?

my wife got pretty upset and just wouldn't hear me out on my reasons. she won't talk to me at all.

am i really in the wrong here? i'm just thinking that my wife is extremely emotional at the moment since she's pregnant and trying to process he ex's death.

any advice?

tldr: my wife's abusive ex-boyfriend died and she wants to name our baby after him. i don't. now, she's mad at me.",7

a few people suggested contacting the law firm on the subpoena which was what i had planned so i contacted them yesterday morning. after not hearing back yesterday i followed up today only to be told they don't get to decide who to send subpoenas to, they get the order from the court and they send it. the law firm suggested contacting the police station to get a copy of the report so i called them immediately after. now for the big twist, after giving my name and city of residence i was informed that i am listed as the victim of the case and the subpoena is to testify against this woman charged of domestic violence. i've requested a copy of the case report but i don't know where to go from there. at this point i'm fully expecting to have to go to court and tell them i have no idea who this woman is and she certainly did not attack me. thanks for the people who commented in the original thread and offered advice. i'm not sure if there is anything else i can do at this point to avoid going to court. would it be helpful to call the court itself and try and explain the scenario or does it all come back to this police report?",2
"tifupdate: increasing my age range on tinder. slightly anticipated update from the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/aorggk/tifu_by_increasing_my_age_range_on_tinder/?utm_source=reddit-android

tl;dr from the above post: i increased the age range on gay tinder, finding one of my brothers best friends, accidentally superlike him, potentially outing me to my entire family

here we go:

what a wild ride it has been, an agonizing two days of slight discomfort.
since the last post, i took some redditors' advice, and sent him a message saying:
""i accidentally sent you a superlike on tinder, oops"", in turn owning the fact i was looking at guys his age.
he's active, but doesn't reply; i start to panic, thinking that maybe it wasn't him who i saw on tinder.

the next hour of wait is painful, until i receive a ""hahahaha don't even worry man!!""

holy shit. phew.

the conversation continued, and we discussed how shook we both were to see eachother, a conversation i visualise* as the two spidermen pointing at each other. as it turns out, barry only recently accepted that he's gay, and his parents are still struggling with the concept.
barry said he'd never been able to discuss any of his feelings or experiences with anyone bc he doesn't really have any gay friends, so it's actually really fortunate what happened. 

it seems like we both gained a gay friend.

to everyone who commented on the first post that he wouldn't out me, thank you! you were right! he didn't tell a soul, and since he's not fully out himself, he said that he would never take that away from me :)))

to those asking about the wedding, no date is planned just yet, but i'll post a 10 year update, in like, 10 years.


tl;dr: my ""fuck up"" of superliking my brother's friend resulted in me gaining a kind and trusty friend who i can now approach anytime :)

also can we appreciate how fucking lucky i am? this ended up as the best case scenario out of them all. 

thank you community for helping me through a very stressful time and giving me something special :') ",4

i've been dating and sleeping with this guy for 3 months, and things have been getting serious lately. i got tested before we got together and he said he was clean too. but then the other night he said he was worried that he might have gotten hiv before we got together, cuz he was having symptoms and he slept with some sketchy dude a couple months before; so he got us both an at-home test. mine was negative, but his came up positive. he acted totally surprised and upset. 

but then i found out from a mutual friend today that he has actually known he's had it for years. when i confronted him about it, he admitted to that and said he's been on art for almost a year now. he said he didn't want to tell me before because he was scared i wouldn't want to be with him. 

i was shocked that he could keep something like that from me and let me have unprotected sex with him for this long without stopping to think of the consequences if he got me sick. i have a 2 year old son who lives at home with me too, which makes this seem even worse to me. like how selfish and careless could you be?

"what being ""pre-approved"" actually means. hello friends! in case you don't know, i currently work at a credit repair company and i just want to spread a piece of information that i think more people need to know:

if you get an email/phone call/ text/ letter from some kind of company (it could be a car company, a loan company, credit car company doesn't matter) saying that you've been ""pre-approved"" that literally means nothing. it's purely just them using a good marketing tactic.

the literal meaning of ""pre-approved"" is ""at a stage before approval"". which is the stupidest thing ever because anyone could be pre-approved for anything. technically i am pre-approved to be the president of the united states. 

""pre-approved"" is a meaningless statement in the credit world, meant to lure people into applying for things. which if you have bad credit, applying and getting denied for things just makes it worse. don't fall for it.


edit: hey guys, so i've got a lot of people telling me how wrong i am, which is fine. the thing is is that yes, some companies will actually pre-approve you in the sense that you are guaranteed to receive whatever it is you're applying for. i would like to emphasize though that that is not the vast majority of cases.

you can just google pre-approval and come up with the same thing i just told you.

the thing that i want for you all to take away from this is do your research. get informed, know what you're applying for. read the fine print. ignorance is how people get their credit screwed up, don't let that happen to you.

"i beat up a 5th grader in highschool.. i was playing basketball at the park with my friend when said 5th grader started talking shit to me. after a while of just shooting the ball, more kids showed up, and even some parents, yet this kid was still calling me a ""n*****"" and ""f****t"" and was being really irritating-mind you he is a white 5th grader. we started some 3vs3 games and we were chilling. the 5th grader started calling me band-aid(i had cut my finger earlier by accident) so i was trying to start being rude back by calling him ""fatass"" (he was overweight). after i beat him he started talking more shit to me and kicked my knee really hard. i was in a lot of pain. he grabbed my leg and pulled me down to the ground. i rolled over so i was on top, i thought i had control of the situation and told the kid to step off or i would hurt him. he proceeded to say ""fuck you band-aid"" and punched me in the eye. this set me off and, well, let's say we won't be seeing that kid any time soon. i punched him in the nose twice and he punched me back. i ended up breaking his nose and hit him hard enough to the point where i fractured his jaw.

"by getting 100% on my chemistry test update. this post was originally removed for not being an fu and breaking rule 2e, but i think that's been resolved. here's the original post:

this happened just now. my chemistry teacher had the bright idea to let us students use ""anything except our friends and our laptops"" during our final unit exam today, and, as can be expected from someone as badass as me, i took it a bit too far. her intention was to allow students to use the textbook and their notes to solve the problems (i'm a junior in high school taking a college-level chem course) to throw us a bone after a really tough unit. so what did i do? as part of my resources, i decided to bring in a second test with answers already on it from the web, thinking that the types of questions asked were likely to be similar and i would have a better idea of what to do.

unfortunately, i didn't expect my chemistry teacher to be as lazy as she is, and as she handed out the test i realized something. she had exactly the same test i had. she had literally just googled the name of our course, found the test, printed it, and handed it out. all i had to do was copy in the answers from my already filled-in test, finishing miles before everyone else, giving me the rest of the period free. so far this story sounds great. as i handed it in, she asked if she could see my resources. my face froze. the silence became louder in my ears. time slowed down. she took the packet from my unmoving hands, leafed through, and looked me straight in the face. five seconds later, everyone's test is gone, and i'm ushered to the principal's office. by virtue of the fact that i am on reddit, i'm already unpopular, so we'll see what happens to my social life now. sitting here waiting for her to come back from lunch, updates to come.

**and here's what happened**: so the principal came back, we talked, the teacher said that i went beyond the bounds of what was acceptable, that it was unfair for me to get the 100%, and i should be punished. after arguing for a while it has been decided that i am not in trouble and my parents won't be contacted. that said, the teacher was violating school rules and as a result everyone has to retake the test, without any resources. no one is talking to me, everyone hates me and was looking forward to an easy grade, and the unpopular guy just became even more unpopular. hopefully she won't just google the next test. what a great day, everyone.

"update my apartment hasn't had power for 48 hours and my landlord isn't responding. what are my next steps? chicago. op: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8s98a2/chicago_my_apartment_hasnt_had_power_for_48_hours/

tldr of op: power was out to half my apartment for days, with no word from landlord.

here's the update! 

the day of my post i filed a complaint with the city and sent my landlord a certified letter explaining the issue and citing chicago municipal code 5-12-110 (thanks, u/trodamus). it took my landlord another two days to call me back and another four days to get an electrician to the apartment. he was on vacation. it sounded like he had a great time.


thanks to cmc 5-12-110, my roommate and i were able to withhold an appropriate amount of rent to reflect the reduced use of our apartment. when we mailed him our rent checks i also mailed him that page of the municipal code. it was a little petty but boy did it feel good.


now that we've declined to resign our lease (in two months), he's claiming that he can show the apartment with as little as 15 minutes notice. he can't, he has to give at least 48 hours notice (according to 5-12-050). 


i mailed him that part of the municipal code too.


thanks so much to everyone for their amazing help and advice. you gave me the confidence and backup to stand up to my landlord who had been sneaking a lot of stuff by us! ",2

anyway, last night i was preparing dinner and enjoying a few glasses of wine. i felt in my element chopping potatoes when suddenly i was struck in the side of my face by a celery stick. i jumped around in battle mode while letting out a war cry. unfortunately i didn't put my knife down before this flailing maneuver and ended up slicing my son's hand open. he screamed, i screamed. the doctor reported me to child services.

"for being upset my son changed his last name to his step-father's last name without telling me?. i will admit, i was never the best father to my oldest son, josh. when he was little, i was an alcoholic and fought with his mother constantly. never anything physical, but he grew up with a lot of yelling and arguing and unfortunately finding me passed out in a drunken stupor many times. when he was about 5, i had an affair with another woman which eventually lead to a child being born. i ended up leaving my wife and starting a family with her and the child i had with her, ben. it was then when i found god and got sober. got a good job opportunity and moved a few states over. i tried to see josh as much as i could, usually a few times a year and some holiday's. my ex-wife was nothing but supportive about him visiting me, i just wish i could have done it more. my ex remarried a few years later to a nice man, and i know he and josh got very close over the years.

for christmas when josh was 15, he came to visit me, my wife and his brother. it was then he had came out to me as gay – and i did not react the way i should have. at that point in my life, i had found christianity and it was tethered to keeping me sober – and unfortunately i bought into a lot of the anti-gay sentiments my local church used to preach. i don't visit that church anymore. for about two years we cut contact but i came to realization that i was wrong and i begged my son for forgiveness. he forgave me and we tried to regain the father/son relationship, although the distance being a few hours away didn't help. we still would only see each other a couple times a year.

my son is now 21 and for this last father's day, he surprised his step dad with a legal name change, changing his last name to match his step father's. when i heard this, my feelings were crushed. he had not even contacted me for father's day. i knew that he and his step dad were close but i didn't think he would ever change his name. the next time i saw him, i asked him about it – why he didn't at least give me a heads up. he told me that while he does forgive me for my past actions; he does not see me as a father figure and that his step father was always there for him. when i mentioned that he now didn't have the same last name as his brother, he said he didn't really care about that as he and his brother admittedly are not close.

i was crushed and angry. i contacted my ex and told he how upset i was with this and how i would have appreciated a heads up from her. she said she had nothing to do with his decision and that he came to her having already decided to change his name. i feel really bitter and resentful; i don't even know where my relationship with my son will go from here now. i know i wasn't the best father but i don't know if i really deserve this? i feel like i should have had a heads up he was changing his name, instead of hearing about it after the fact. here?

&#x200b;

**edit**: reading the replies has really opened my eyes. my anger and resentment is misplaced and is coming from a place of complete guilt. i'm not angry or resentful of my son, i'm angry at myself for my past actions but my ego is making it feel otherwise. i'm currently writing a letter to my son's step father thanking him for being there for my son. i'm also going to apologize to my ex for blaming her for this because that was not right. i never brought any of this up to my son - after he gave me his explanation i stayed quiet. i know i've been a terrible father for most of his life - i hope even if he doesn't see me as a father figure, we can have a good relationship as an adult. he is a very thoughtful and forgiving person and i'm lucky he has given me multiple chances after many many screw-ups to still be apart of his life. i'm not going to mess it up again. thank you, reddit.",3
"my retired father has a considerable income but is having trouble paying bills/taxes. i'm worried about his spending habits. what course of action, if any, can i take?. my father is 74, he is retired. he inherited \~1.5 million usd from his parents. he has that money invested into an annuity, from which he receives over 5,000 usd a month. he also collects social security, and has a very small retirement from working at american airlines. overall, his monthly income is more than 6,000 usd.

&#x200b;

he lives in utah and his rent is just under 1,400 a month. he is having trouble paying his bills, he cancelled his cable subscription because he couldn't afford to pay 300 usd per month for it. he always has trouble paying his income taxes. he also regularly brags about wearing 2,000 skiing outfits. he claims all of his skiing outfits cost that much.

he asked me if he could use my address (i live in california) as his place of residence so that he can avoid paying utah state taxes. he wanted me to send all of his bills, mail, etc. to him in utah. i told him i couldn't do that because i did not want to knowingly assist him in committing tax fraud. his immediate response was to remove my phone from his verizon plan after sending me a text message saying he does not want to speak to me and that i'm not welcome at his funeral.

"pretty sure my friend is being scammed. here is the story he told me. plenty of red flags but i'm interested if anyone has any experience with a similar situation.

so essentially a few months ago my friend purchased a 5 year anti virus/computer protection service from a company called ""yale vision"". i googled around and can not seem to find this company first of all. my friend goes ahead and pays $400 (wtf who pays $400 for antivirus??) for 5 years of service.

fast forward to yesterday, few months after purchase, someone supposedly from the company calls my friend and explains that they are going out of business and he is owed a refund. so after a long drawn out process, the rep transfers the refund to my friends bank account. he was supposed to get $400 and he realizes the rep sent him $4000. 

so my friend goes ""hey man you sent me 4000 not 400"". cue the rep freaking out, getting management on the line, freaking out. they go on to ask him to go to the nearest walmart and transfer them the money right now to avoid any delays because they need their money back.

my friend, thinking he just hit community chest in monopoly, essentially tells them to kick rocks and hangs up. they call back, he doesn't answer and goes on to block them. 

he is pretty convinced that it was some sort of error on their part and this money is his now.

to me, this sounds like one of the fake check scams where you end up over drawing your account and getting robbed but i don't know. 

did my friend just make a $4000 come up or is he as gullible as i think he is? if the company did make a mistake, can he legally keep the money? is he going to be taken to court if the firm did make an error like that?


**edit: did not expect this to blow up the way it did. i told him from the jump this is a major scam and i really appreciate everyone bringing to light some of the potential threats i did not consider.

 fast forward a couple months they closed seven locations with no warning. we started having none of our supply orders filled and could barely maintain our clinics. it was told that they were having financial issues and things would improve. with the closures. 

 then everyones 401k contributions stopped, even though they were still taken from paychecks. we were told it was temporary and they would be returned. by this time a lot of people left, those that had contributed thousands to their 401k. i fortunately never had one.

i worked 114 hours before all of the locations closed. my manager called me crying. she told me to send a demand for payment and file a complaint for wage theft, and get on unemployment. i did all of those but for unemployment they are saying they have no records of any of us working there. we are unsure if quarterly taxes were done. one employee was (almost?) arrested because his child payments weren't being made. 

it's made local news, and i heard from there that the state (co) is investigating this, but all efforts to contact the owner has returned nothing.

"for giving my wife a baby hamster after she miscarried two months ago?. me and my wife have been married for almost two years. its been our dream to have a big family. she is 21, i am 24. we are both healthy and have an active sex life, but she has a heart shaped uterus and has miscarried twice,  the last time being two months ago. after losing two of my children i am also depressed but i try to keep a positive attitude for her.

our second miscarriage was in the second trimester and was very difficult as we both started to feel like ""mommy and daddy"". we were ""competing"" over which gender it would be.

i thought the baby would be a boy so i bought a bunch of baseball stuff for babies, little hats and mitts. i also made my ringtone on my phone ""watching scotty grow"" by bobby goldsboro. just sort of a playful thing since i joked we would name him after my grandpa scott, she wanted a girl and made hers that ""girls want to have fun"" song.

anyway, the baby was a girl named charlotte. shes been despondent these past few months. i havent been exactly ecstatic either but she wont even eat some days.

i kept my ringtone the same for a little bit, partly because i was sad and partly because i forgot. she heard it one day and started crying terribly. i changed it, but i also resolved then to try and make her feel at least somewhat better.

wife doesnt like cats and dogs arent allowed where we live but she had a hamster growing up. i bought a baby hamster with a big glass case and put a teeny tiny pink bow on her. i gave her to my wife with a card that said ""would you be my new mommy?""

she reacted terribly to it and said that it made her feel horrible and that i was being an insensitive asshole. im just trying to help and the way she reacted put me on the defense so we got into an argument and arent on speaking terms since last friday. i keep the hamster with me on the coffee table as i sleep on the living room couch. ive seen her play with it but she wont talk to me.

"by not finding a better place to hide my weed.. well thankfully this didn't happen today or yesterday.  this fuck up actually happened when i was a kid...about 16?(which is why i can laugh about it now!)  

so anyways... back in the day i used to enjoy a little bud as a high schooler.  most of my friends did as well, but we lived in utah at the time which means pretty much none of our parents were cool with smoking...quite the opposite in fact. 

so with our strict parents in mind as little stoner high school kids we have to think of some pretty creative ways to hide our weed. i even unscrewed my dvd player, hid weed in it and my mom still almost found it. 

this time i was going to make sure was different!   i was going to find the best place i could to hide it.  i thought to myself shortly after buying some weed for my friends birthday...""i bet hiding this outside would be perfect!""  ""she won't smell it and she never comes out here, so she won't just find it!"" so as i'm outside smoking with my friend, i feel like i hit the goldmine of weed hiding ideas! we wrap up smoking and my mom's coming home soon, so i scout the yard and decide to hide my weed in the very back of the yard, wedged in between a fence and my shed. over top of the weed i placed a big wooden 2x4.  i go to bed happy as can be because i think i've finally won.  
so i wake up the next morning and went to school. just another normal day.  i get home to both my parents being at my moms.  this already sets off a red flag in my mind because having divorced parents, the only time they hang out together is when someone's in trouble.
so i walk in the door to find them sitting at the table waiting for me.  at this point i'm expecting them to have find a pipe or some papers. ha! i sit down at the table and my dad pulls out this bag of weed.  i was just like what the fuck how did you find this?!?! do you have hidden cameras or some shit!?!?  my mom slowly starts smiling and points to my australian shepherd.  apparently my dog saw me hide it, got a little curious and decided to prance around the yard with my bag of weed in her mouth right as my mom was outside having a cigarette. 

yes i definitely got grounded.

also, yes the dog is still alive and i'm writing this right next to the bitch!

"by uploading my old exams on the internet.. so this all happened in june, and i'm only writing about it now because the situation just got solved.

as the broke college student i am i found a website that offered me money for my notes about classes and old exams that i have taken, extremely simply procedure that consists of simply uploading pdfs on the web, categorizing them, and then getting a payment on my paypal. i think ""great! i make money and i can help kids seeing what to expect on the exam by seeing the old ones"". 

the fact that i scanned all my exams and kept them in my google drive to have them as possible study material made the whole process easier. i upload 5 documents from my organic chemistry class and get paid $25, i figure that i might as well do it for all the classes, more money to buy alcohol you know?

in the span of a couple days i upload about 120 documents for subjects such as ochem, physics, calculus that span from old exams to notes to summaries about the whole class, pretty much my old study materials. i get a couple hundred bucks and go buy my, at the time, well deserved booze.

fast forward a month, and i have just given all my finals, got my 4.0 this term and i am happily preparing to go back home. i wake up one morning with an email from my email professor informing me that due to the content i uploaded he is gonna fail me in the class even if i passed it with an a. 
i immediately panic, i start freaking out.
to make matters worse, i get an email from my physics professor with the same exact content, failing the class even though i passed it.

now i am actually freaking the fuck out, i am an international student in the us so now i'm scared my visa is gonna get cancelled and that i am a dead man.

next day i receive an email from the director of student affairs asking to meet me to discuss the question. i'm hoping he will just give me a slap on the wrist and tell me to not do it again. i meet him and after a two hour meeting he informs me that most likely i will be expelled from the school, not allowing me to enroll at the university i was transferring to and ultimately revoking my visa. i get home and have an absolute breakdown, i can't tell my parents because they will fucking disown me so i have this weight on my back that's literally killing me. 

however, the decision wasn't final so the director asks to meet me again the next week. every day that passes it becomes worse. i don't know what to do with myself. i have so much shit going one that i start having suicidal thoughts, i am at the lowest point of my life (i've been lucky enough to never have experienced any real problems).
the day comes and the fucking director tells me that he will not give me a final decision today and that he will contact me via email, due to the fact that i am leaving to go back to my home country and won't be in the states to personally see him.

i fly back home, and after approximately three days i get an email informing me that i have been suspended for the summer term, i have a 2500 word paper about academic integrity and my gpa has been lowered to a 1.0 for the term. however, i will be able to transfer to the university i was planning to go and i will get to keep my academic scholarship. 
additionally, i have to write a paper of 2500 words about academic integrity that includes interview to two professors along with some other assignments that will be communicated me later.

fast forward a couple of months and i am currently on a plane flying towards my new college, with a hue weight off my shoulders.


tl;dr i uploaded old college exams on the internet, went from a 4.0 to a 1.0 for the term, nearly got expelled and deported. 

edit: i forgot to add that i had to remove all the documents i uploaded, only way to do so was refunding the company that paid me via paypal. so overall, i didn't end up earning one cent.

edit 2: holy fuck this blew up way more than i expected.

i've been getting a lot of mixed reactions, people feeling bad for what happened (which they shouldn't) and people ripping my asshole apart (rightfully so).

just to specify a few things that i might have gone over too quickly. 
the exams were semester old exams/weeks old, as i wanted to make sure nobody could benefit from the uploads as they would have been required to already take it.
secondly my gpa for the term was lowered to a 1.0, this impacted my overall gpa a tiny bit but i was still
able to secure an academic scholarship at the university i transferred to.

i didn't post it the with the purpose of saying ""fuck my college they are a bunch of douchebags"", it was more with the intent to show how little, at the time meaningless, actions can fuck up your future, big time.
especially because i just assumed i would be able to do in the us things that i used to do in high school back at home.

i am grateful to the school for the course of action they took, as i know that things could have been way way worse.

edit #2: for those messaging asking what i did. i worked remotely as an onboarding manager for a digital marketing agency. 40 hours a week, salary. i wasn't given a reason why i was being fired, but i suspect it was due to a client complaint that happened a few weeks prior. the onboarding client at the time kept sending me the wrong thing and got extremely worked up after i sent him an email with the words ""i'm sorry, but this is not what we need"". kept sending wordpress backend access to his website when i was simply asking for domain hosting information from godaddy. he got mad at me and complained directly to the ceo threatening to quit. ceo flipped out and was ready to fire me on the spot, but was convinced not to by my manager. from then on, i felt weird vibes from my manager almost every day. things started to clear up on onboarding in terms of workload, and they were having me offboard the remainder of my clients to their assigned csm. it's clear to me now that they were waiting for things to die down before pulling the plug. i was definitely in shock while i was being fired because i didn't even ask why. they told me they're not going to be paying me for november, but prorating me for the days worked this month thus far. doesn't feel right at all, but then again this company has a history of shitting on their employees.

edit #3: to those offering to help edit my resume/cover letter, and assist in teaching how to interview. you are truly amazing human beings. i don't really have the words. thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to offer help to a complete stranger. thank you. to those who have been through what i'm going through right now, thank you for helping me feel understood. i truly am sorry. no one should ever have to go through this... on the bright side, this thread has 100% helped my mindset, and i don't feel as mentally dazed anymore. i've taken many of your advice to heart and i intend on acting upon them. i'm glad i posted this.",10

"24f went through a toxic breakup this morning and ringing in 2019 alone with no friends and terrible home life. need advice on everything, feeling really lost and depressed. edit: truly did not expect this post to take off like this. i am so overwhelmed (in the best way possible) by the immense outpouring of love and support from each and every one of you around the world. i've read every comment, post, message and am trying to reply to every single one but please know all of you have made my 2019 start on the best note possible and i'm so thankful for all of you. thank you for your advice, support, love, sharing your stories, kindness to a complete stranger. i love you all ❤️

hi everyone, long time follower of this sub, first time posting using a throwaway. it's 2 hours short of 2019 and i 24f haven't felt this alone or sad in a long time. i'm sorry in advance this is so long and kind of all over the place but that's kind of just my life recently. 

went through a breakup this morning with an on-again, off-again guy 27m i've been seeing since september. we love each other but have a lot of issues and it's been getting increasingly toxic. we've broken up probably 5+ times and this probably sounds so stupid that i keep taking him back but it's really painful and hurts because he's my best friend. i know i just need to stay away but he always tries to reconnect about a week after we end things saying he loves & misses me and things will change, and they do for a few days, but then he goes back to being really distant and canceling plans and messing with my head and making me feel like shit. my new years resolution is to stop taking him back and cut him out for good. 

aside from that, i really feel like i don't have any true friends anymore and i even don't know how i got here. my other best friend is an ex - we have been platonic for almost a year now, dated for 1.5 yrs but have been friends since high school. he asked to stop talking for a while because he felt like he still had feelings for me and i don't; i fully understand and respect that. beyond that i have other acquaintances, mostly from work, but no one i'm really close with. i know the simple solution here is to make more friends but i can't figure out how. i've gone to bars alone more times than i'm willing to admit, fitness classes, hiking, etc - it usually ends up in more acquaintances or hookups just to not feel lonely for the night. and so i've kind of lost interest in trying new things and putting myself out there. sometimes i go on dating apps just to feel like i have someone to talk to (my matches). 

lastly, i live at home with my parents because i work nearby and rent here is just outrageous and it just works out, but they're extremely anti-affectionate and always super negative. we've never celebrated a holiday, birthday, special occasion for no particular reason and they've never really been supportive about anything. always distilling the idea that i'll never be good enough (at my job, to keep a guy, etc). over this holiday break i've been cooped up at home with nowhere to go and it's constantly dead eerie quiet 24/7 (they don't speak to each other) and just a horrible atmosphere. they're also extremely overprotective and get upset when i go out and need to know every detail of where i'm going, when i'll be back, etc. they put alerts on all credit card and banking activity and insist on shared accounts and what not. 

i've tried therapy but it's always been really discouraging and unsuccessful, and especially today where everyone's celebrating and seems so happy, i've never felt more alone and hopeless. just seeking words of encouragement and advice from anyone who has been or are currently in my shoes. normally it doesn't affect me that much because work is a huge distraction but with all this down time it's really beginning to mess with me. thank you for reading.

now, after they left, my wife asked me if i can make the same one for the girl. my wife told me that the girl really liked the neclace and asked if she could have one. i told her that it was something i made for my daughter and i don't want to share that or make it for anyone. no one can replace her. my wife thinks that our daughter would be really happy if we shared her memory with someone who had similar struggles and that i'm being selfish. here?",3
"a rapist and con artist get caught by the sheriff in a small town.. the town doesn't have much money to take care of prisoners so the sheriff gets an idea. he decides he'll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can. the sheriff figures even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little ""justice"" from the townspeople.

the sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. he tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

after a while there are two long lines for the criminals. some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. after a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist's face is a bloody pulp and thinks ""he's so beat up at this point, he probably can't even feel anything anymore. i'm not going to waste my money on that."" so the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

"if i still give my stepson the birthday gift i bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift my upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first?. my husband joe and i have been married for a few years. he has a teenage son, jack, with his ex-wife kim. joe and i have a great relationship with jack, who lives with us half of the time, and we are civil with kim. 

for a couple of years now, jack has been into a sport that i am also into, and last year he decided to train in that sport seriously. he has been doing very well so as a reward and to encourage him further i decided that for his birthday this month, i would buy him an important 'equipment' used in our sport. he has always wanted to own one himself and if things go well it will be with him for the next ten years so i know he will be very happy with it. 

yesterday kim called me and told me what gift she will be getting jack (we do this now to avoid getting him the same gift, which has happened before). i told her that i got jack the equipment for our sport. she was quiet for a while and then asked me if i could get another gift for jack's birthday and just give him the equipment in october.

kim said that she knows jack will absolutely love my gift, so if he gets my gift and her gift at the same time, her gift will be upstaged by mine and all of jack's attention will be on my gift. she said she has been saving for jack's gift for a while so she would like to see him be happy and thrilled about her gift, and that is not likely to happen if jack receives our gifts at the same time. 

i understand where kim is coming from, but to me it doesn't seem right to treat giving gifts to jack as a competition for his attention or affections that we have to resort to 'taking turns'. why can't we both give him our gifts and make him as happy as he could be on his birthday, a day that it supposed to be about him and not about us?",3

"a lemon, a potato, and a pea all had a tough week working at the grocery store.... ...so they decided to let off some steam with a bar crawl at the weekend.

they had a great time, hitting bar after bar, knocking back drinks, but being so genetically different, the alcohol affected them each in different ways: the lemon got very acidic and refluxy; the potato, being a big starchy chap, took the booze in his stride; while the little pea reacted to all the sugar and started to get a touch hyperactive.

at the end of the night, the three friends found themselves leaving a bar at the top of a tall hill, when all of a sudden the pea started bouncing up and down excitedly: ""lads! lads! i've got a great idea! we're all vaguely round in shape, let's not get a cab home, let's just roll down the hill!"" and before the others could protest he was off - shooting down the hill at a rate of knots.

the lemon lurched after him, but soon started listing violently from side to side as he went, owing to his oval shape, which did nothing for his unsettled stomach. with a sigh, the potato trundled along slowly behind.

by the time the potato had bounced his way to the bottom of the hill, the lemon was spewing lemon juice all over the pavement, but the pea was already jumping up and down again ""that was great, that was great, let's do it again!"". 

the lemon was now chundering up pips with the acid, but the pea didn't seem to care ""come on! let's go again, that was great!"".

the potato turned to him and said ""easy peasy, lemon's queasy.""

"ma landlord let new tenant move into my vacant unit during my lease. edit: thanks everyone for the sanity check. i was originally a bit annoyed but considering letting this slide along with the return of my entire deposit + my a/c unit, but now i think i may go for more. contacted a couple firms in my area to see what the next steps are.

tldr - i had overlapping leases and left my old unit vacant for a month but with a few items still there. i showed up today to do final cleaning and pick up my items and the unit was remodeled and the new tenants things were stored in the closets. my things were gone. what is my recourse?

-----

i have overlapping leases, one of them ends aug 31st. i moved out of that unit last week of july. i was in contact with the new tenant moving in sept 1st and he was unwilling to pay to move in early so i told him as a courtesy he could move in aug 31 free of charge. i then left some cleaning supplies and an ac unit at my old unit, just using it as storage as i lived at my new place. i let my landlord know i was planning on moving out early and that i'd let them know when they could do a walk-through to assess the unit, and they said ""okay, let us know."" that was the last communication i had with them.

i went to my old unit today to retrieve my things and they were all gone and the unit was remodeled. the new tenant had also stored his belongings in my closet. i paid full rent for august and they did all of this without my consent or notifying me at all. they kept the ac unit and have offered to deliver it to my new address but all my cleaning supplies ($50) are gone.

i talked with the landlord and she claims the new tenant called once a day claiming i said they could move in early and the landlord eventually caved and let them. what is my recourse here? it seems insane they thought they could do all of this without my consent. i assume i am at least entitled to my full security deposit back as i was not here to confirm any damages, but what more could i hope for if i decided to take legal action?

last communication i had with landlord was on 8/13 where i said 

""i'll let you know in the next week or two when the unit is ready for a walk through, i have a couple things still there and have to finish cleaning.""

and she said that was fine.",2

the shopkeeper says, ""i've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting.

**edit: i'm not born or raised in belgium, i moved here about 2 years ago and still learning much about the place.**

&#x200b;

***thanks for the silver on the post! much appreciated.***

&#x200b;

never will i ever be this spontaneous again. it's weekend and we wanted to spend time together. for some reason we really felt spontaneous this particular day and decided to go to paris just to see the eiffel tower. we live in belgium and it was a 4 hour trip, but we were really determined.

we even feel like the cool, spontaneous couple at this point and the trip there was good, i even mentioned that it's the journey that matter to me and the fact we did go through with it. i was seeing it as a weekend road-trip and everything was going good, but keep im mind i did not google or do any looking up as we didn't really use our phones much this weekend.

once we got into france the landscape was beautiful and full of nature and long fields like u see on the windows default background, but ten times more amazing.

however

once we actually started heading into paris things started to become more city-like and not the good kind. the roads were bad and the traffic started becoming quite aggressive. i just thought it was probably because of the weekend, but the deeper into paris we went the worse it got.

then it happened. we had arrived at what i now know is the ""arc de triomphe"".

this was no longer traffic, but a free for all; the likes of which i had never seen before. i was dazed, confused and scared. drivers all over were just going like a beehive. pushing in quite aggressively and just taking charger not giving a crap wether they were going to get hit or not. i was driving a rental, so i was worried i would get hit.

just to paint you a clear picture, imagine a huge field; maybe the size of a small football field. now imagine no road-signs, no traffic lights, no ground-indicators or even lanes. it's an 8 lane round-about with no lanes...

the worse thing is the entirety of paris seems to be in this state, the chaos and aggressive driving. i started noticing one in every four car had a huge dent. i had legit never ever seen something this terrifying before. the only way to describe traffic in paris is a free for all, first come first served and taking a lot of risk and chances.

when i finally had cleared this monstrosity i was so relieved, but then my second happened right after. as i pulled out of the arc, i noticed bricks everywhere; about 10 cop riot cars and protesters everywhere. the street legit looked like there had been a huge explosion, tear gas on the streets and everything was broken. my partner and i were both in awe. we didn't know what we were looking at.

apparently there was a huge riot going on and according to the french the most aggressive riot ever. they are calling it the yellow jacket riots and we were not suppose to even be there. the french president is holding everyone there responsible for the damages. at that point we simply were too scared to even stay there anymore, we turned the car around and i was desperately looking for any other way out of there besides the arc, but to my shock i was forced to drive back on the arc.

good news, i made it; no damage to the car or ourselves; but we did decide to look into cities we want to visit before going next time.

tl;dr drove a 4 hour trip to paris in a spontaneous moment and ended up being shocked by it's chaotic traffic and also ended up in the middle of a huge riot.

"negotiating salary with a new company. would it be unprofessional to mention that i'd be walking away from a bonus with my current employer in hopes of getting a higher offer?. basically, i'm currently employed and considering leaving my job for a number of reasons. i've just received an offer with a new company. i made the unfortunate mistake of giving a salary range before learning about the new company's benefits, and i definitely undersold myself. the company just gave me a formal offer with a salary at the bottom of the range i gave them. it's about a 12% increase from what i make now, but i'd be losing some pretty fantastic benefits. i don't really feel like i can complain, but truthfully this would be a lateral move. i plan on negotiating, seeing as this isn't enough to get me to move.

now, my current company has just given me a bonus of $5k, but it won't hit my account until the end of the month. if i accept this offer i'm almost certain they won't honor the bonus and i can't blame them. would it be unprofessional to mention this bonus in my negotiations with the new company? or should i stick to talking about the benefits?

delaying my start date doesn't feel like an option seeing as i'd have to delay it almost 6 weeks to avoid giving my notice before the bonus is paid.

"by cleaning my son's room. i was cleaning my 6y.o. son's room, and doing my annual purge of crap he's managed to hoard. i have this big pile of stuff to throw out in the living room, when he comes in, pulls some stupid paper butterfly out of the trash pile and tells me i can't throw this away because it was a present.

he goes to a lot of birthday parties and gets a lot of goodie bags with this sort of thing, so i tell him it's junk and it's going in the trash. besides, it's all bent up and i tell him (like a douche-dad) that if he values things he should take care of them.

he leaves, and some 5 minutes later he returns, visibly distraught (he's clearly been thinking hard about this). he says ""it was a present...for you.""

""for father's day.""

i swear at that moment i heard every angel in heaven slow clapping.

edit: whoa, go to sleep, then to work, then come back to a crap-ton of comments. deserving of some additional context.

as some hawk-eyed redditors astutely noted, it's nowhere near father's day so the ""t"" in this is symbolic. this allows me to provide some more details. first, my son is 10 now, i was reminded yesterday of the incident which of course put the pit back in the bottom of my stomach again. i thought about adding the ""obligatory this wasn't today"" disclaimer but after reading the sub rules i was convinced not to.

following the ""no, it's a present for *you*"" revelation, i apologized, then we smoothed out the creases in the butterfly and my son took it back into his room. he ended up wrapping it up for me on father's day anyhow, and he was so excited to see me open the present even though i had figuratively shat all over it. it was really sweet.

"for refusing to donate my hair to my aunt with cancer?. for context, i'm adopted and have super long & very thick red hair. no one in my adopted family has hair like mine,and it's been kind of a thing for them to touch, admire, & talk about my hair at family gatherings since i was a kid. my aunt has lung cancer, and it's really taken a toll on her. she's lost all her hair and has talked about getting a wig, but they're too expensive and she says she wants real hair. my mom suggested i donate my hair to make a wig for my aunt at easter dinner, and my aunt got so excited she started crying. i felt horrible about it, and didn't say anything. we went to this wig place and the lady said she could make a shoulder length wig for my aunt using my hair. (i keep it up extremely well & it's down to my knees) my aunt started crying again and again i feel so awful, but i really don't want to part with my hair. i know it grows back but still.

no one had asked me how i felt, but i think my mom could tell i wasn't very excited about it because she asked the lady if she could donate her own hair, and she said she'd need both my sister (mom's biological daughter) and my mom to donate their hair, since it's very thin, and she could only make a chin length wig with it. my aunt also wants red hair, so the lady said she'd have to dye it & that would cause it damage & cost more than using my hair. my uncle then said it'd make much more sense to use mine.

it's been a month and my aunt wants to know when we can make the appointment. i don't know what to do. i told my sister and she called me ungrateful and told me to stop being selfish because it would grow back. if i'm ta i won't hesitate to donate it but i don't know anymore.

edit: people suggested i clarify, i have knee length hair & i'd have to cut all of it off to the scalp in order to make the wig.

to all the people saying it doesn't take that much hair to make a wig: it does. one average donation of hair doesn't make a full wig, they match it with other donations. it usually takes 2-3 heads of hair for a full wig. mine is long enough on its' own for a full wig, and my aunt doesn't want synthetic hair mixed in to supplement it.
i completely understand everyone that said i was the asshole for not saying no in the beginning. i'm not trying to justify that, but i want to make it clear that it's extremely difficult for me to stand up to my family. i don't think i've ever had a say in anything since i started living with them, and that's how it's always been. they never give me a voice, even though i should have spoken up. it always goes without saying that what my mom says will happen.",3
"for telling a kid that she's the reason i got a dashcam?.  

there are three children, elementary aged, that live on my street, two a couple houses down from me, the other across the street from them. they are constantly running into the road to cross, or after something, or riding some toy down the middle (bike, three-wheeler, scooter). as such i creep down my road past their house to get to mine. like, 10-15 mph with the clutch in and my foot hovering over the break. 

well, about a week ago i am creeping along as the kids are riding bikes down the middle of the road. the youngest is in the middle of the road heading for me, but looking behind her to her brother. i realized that she isn't going to stop so, with cars on either side so i couldn't pull over, i come to a stop in the middle of the road. 

as i am putting my car in reverse, she turns around and sees me. she swerves around me, and lets out a ""whoa."" i wait for the others to clear the road, and move past and park in my driveway. i was getting out of my car when the girl rides up behind my car. ""you almost hit me!""

i calmly told her that no, she almost hit me, and that she and her brother are the reason why i got a dashcam. (there are other benefits, but the kids were my primary motivation.) she didn't understand, but then asked about my daughter (high school age) and if she was still in school because she's so old. 

i answered, and went inside thinking nothing more of it. about an hour later there is a hammering on my door. my husband answered to see the girl's mom. she sees me and starts screaming about how horrible i am that i told her daughter that i got a dashcam because of her and her brother. 

my husband closed the door in her face and locked it. 

i recounted this to a coworker, and they said i'm an asshole for telling the kid the truth even if it didn't bother the kid. i don't think so because the kids need to learn to have more awareness around the road. so i will accept my judgment.",3

"modern feminism, ""boss babe"" and ""girl power"" culture is really patronizing, degrading, and it is counterintuitive to the main message that equality is supposed to represent.. i am a mid-20s female, and this mentality just drives me insane. i get where people are coming from, but it just sounds so infantilizing to have an entire ""movement"" based around this idea that women need reassurance that they're capable, powerful, and smart too. 

for example, i am a small business owner, and i find it frustrating when other businesses go out of their way to say they're ""woman-owned"". it's like, okay...great...good for you, i guess? should i applaud you or something? it's not a woman-owned business. it's just a fucking business, get over yourself.

the thing is, i'm not oblivious to the struggles women have had in the past, and still have to some degree today. but at some point, equality is equality and it's entirely counterintuitive to your cause if you're making up all these special treatments for women. 

i want help and support because i asked, because i need it, because i deserve it (if, in whatever situation, i do deserve it. sometimes we don't.). i don't want this weird, automatic, yet backhanded support just because i'm a female. 

another thing i hate is when other women are like, ""it's your obligation as a female to support other females!"" uhh no. i will support you if i believe in you and what you're doing. but just because we both share a commonality, doesn't mean our values automatically align.

don't get me wrong, i'm proud to be a woman! or...at least as proud as normal people are about something they didn't earn or make happen themselves...like, it's fine and i'm happy with it. but, seriously. if you're a woman and you feel like you need that much reassurance in your life about your own autonomy and capabilities, then i'd say you should probably start doing some introspection into why that is, instead of constantly looking for it externally.",6
"leaving my husband. made a bullet list of conversation topics to keep my head straight. any advice, opinions welcomed.. i (24f) have been married to my husband (30m) for 2 years, together for 5. we have 2 boys under 3.

-your deep voice.

-your up beat spirit, always laughing, always joking.

-your dimple smile.

-your integrity, your honestness

-the way you provide tirelessly for your family

-your handsomeness  

-your big heart.

-the way you play with the boys and make them smile.

things that are not working. (we have talked about everyone of these, to no avail.)

-your selfishness with your down time. 
(always doing what you need, video games, on your phone, running your personal errands, not recognizing that i need personal down time too) 

-the way you isolate (we have no friends, no social life, you don't even want to visit with my family)

-the way you expect me to isolate with you. (if i'm not with the kids, and doing something while you are working or having your down time, you expect me to be there with you when you are ready.)

-manipulating me to not leaving you alone with the kids (when i was at the gym or my aa meeting or an appointment, you would demand me back right away, guilt tripping me. when i would leave and rush home caleb would be calm anyway.)

-our intimacy issues. (we have never been on the same page, sadly i have begun to loose interest in you sexually) 

-the way you have exhausted the extravagant gift giving, (buying gifts doesn't replace the glue that is slipping away) 

-they way you act like you are better than everyone else because your now on a sober path, (you look down on people who drink or smoke pot, 75% of the population does, it doesn't make them a bad person, or an addict)

-the way that i'm 100% ignored; physically, emotionally, mentally, sexually, (you are always so lost in your phone or game you never hear me, you are not interested in me until i get upset.)

-the way you hold financial burden over my head. (belittle me because you are the breadwinner, ""good luck having a life with no income"")

-the way you take ""jokes"" too far. (you know you are making me upset and you turn passive aggressiveness into a game and claim you are just joking, having fun.)

-the way we both are stubborn, butting heads, never backing down, trying to hurt each other with words. (we are unhealthy, the kids hear us fighting and it's untrue that they would be better off if we stick together. they need two happy, healthy parents, even if we're not under the same roof.)

"sex scenes in movies are stupid and serve no purpose.. first of all, i've never actually heard anyone say they like sex scenes in movies, just when the scene is taken out and even then, it's just shitty porn. 

90% of the time, the sex adds nothing to the plot and could have easily just been implied and it wouldn't have changed the movie. 

really the only people who are happy about sex scenes in movies are horny guys who want to see their favorite actress's upper cleavage and maybe even the full breast. yeah that's nice when you don't have to watch it with someone who is probably your family. 

tonight specifically, i was going to watch a movie with my sister and dad but they chose a movie i know has an explicit scene in it and i can't fucking stand that and it makes me so uncomfortable. 

most of the arguments where people are like sex scenes are good go along the lines of ""sex happens in real life and it's natural and movies depict real life so they should show that."" first of all, there's nothing different if you just imply the sex vs showing it, and secondly, it definitely makes people uncomfortable to watch with family and probably friends because no matter how hard you try, sex is very stigmatized and you can't change it. 

something even worse than sex scenes in their uselessness is just nudity for the sake of nudity. that character didn't need to be fully nude in that shot all their doing is lying in bed, or they are getting dressed so apparently i have to see them naked you couldn't just stop at the bra. also, when a movie shows the entire stripper it's unnecessary. i've seen a few movies that had scenes in strip clubs but avoided the nudity by just showing the legs and using the strip club exclusively as a backdrop. 

tldr: sex/nude scenes serve little to no purpose in movies and could've easily been just implied and get the same point across and all they actually accomplish are making you uncomfortable and preventing people like me from watching the movie with their family ",6
"for playing loud annoying music specifically when my roommate was having sex?. she and her boyfriend are really loud. if this was during a reasonable hour then i'd be better with it but this is literally midnight to 3am (not for all 3 hours but starts any time in this window). this keeps me awake when i have to work morning shifts and get to work for 5am most days, so i really need to be able to sleep through the night, which she knows, and even with earplugs they still managed to wake me.

i tried wearing earplugs, then headphones, neither worked, so i've asked them to keep it down more than once. last night they were being exceptionally loud and when i asked them to keep it down, she insisted that i couldn't hear anything. i took out my phone and bluetooth speaker, put the speaker in a bookshelf that is up against our shared wall, and played whatever songs i could think of to ruin the mood.

the songs included, but were not limited to:

* *i just had sex* and *finest girl* by lonely island
* *bananaphone*
* *we should definitely not have sex right now* from crazy ex girlfriend
* *always look on the bright side of life*

and a few others.

about half an hour went by and she leaves her room and pounds on my door telling me to keep it down. the walls are paper thin so she can hear the music the same way i can hear the moaning. today at breakfast she said ""we'll keep it down from now on, you don't have to be such a dick about it.""

i thought we'd be able to laugh it off because they were jokey songs that i picked, clearly for a laugh, and i figured she'd see the funny side but then she said the thing about me not having to be a dick about it and now i feel like a dick.

am i the asshole?

edit: please stop suggesting i record audio of them going at it. it's weird, she's my friend, and it's just really a step too far.

info: they've been doing this for maybe 10 weeks, give or take? i've asked her to stop at least once, sometimes twice, per week since he started coming over, so roughly a dozen requests to keep it down over nearly 3 months.

"update - my gf (28f) joked about male enlargement pills, i (28m) brushed it off.... two days later she says ""i bought you something.."". dear redditors, see the original post here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dljukt/my_gf_28f_joked_about_male_enlargement_pills_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) (i am able to see it, but not sure if others are who are saying ""post removed."") so here is recap:

**tl;dr:  gf of two years sent me a link and to some of those male enlargement pills that can supposedly grow a penis by three inches in 30 days. i thought she was just joking so i ""lol'd,"" said no, and brushed it off. when i saw her two days after, she said ""i have something for you."" to my surprise, she pulled out a bottle of those pills. she didn't consult with me or asked i was okay with taking them, etc she kept pushed the pills on me and i told her the pills don't work and the to leave. i am comfortable with my size, but i guess she wants more.**

i want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who gave amazing feedback and told me to stay the hell away from those pills, admired my confidence in sharing my penis size, and told me to communicate. i did not take, and do not plan on taking them now or ever in my life. i also want to thank those who said talk with her and offer solutions such as sheath/sleeve to help her fulfill her fantasy.

we had a serious conversation. she knew she fucked and admitted that she at no point took my thoughts and feeling into consideration and she regretted that. i told her what many of you said, to consider my health if i were to actually take those pills. i showed her examples of what could happen with all the chemicals and other crap those things have. i even told her those damn things could give me a heart attack or worse. she started crying as if i had died and jumped in hugged me super hard and asked me to please forgive her and that she would not want anything to happen to me or put my health in jeopardy. to help her understand why i told her to leave when she gave me the pills, i showed her my original post and let her see the comments all of you provided... in the end, i forgave her.

i just want to end it by saying that this was a good test in our relationship. we actually got intimate after and both of us did not have an issue getting pleasure (shocking, i know). now she is giving me more attention, spoiling the shit out of me, and showing how much she appreciates me. :)

p.s. to all the haters in the comments from the original post saying ""fake,"" ""you have a small dick,"" ""take the pills,""""what kind of gf talks like that, this is a porno,"" etc..., all i have to say is: keep hating you lonely bastards. love you!",7

he introduced himself, asks if i remember who he is and what he does. explains that he can smell from outside and inside his apartment below and to the left of us. he's upset he had to explain what the smell was to his daughter, and was upset that other families around me likely had to smell it. told me that between my friends socks and the smells he has enough that he doesn't even need a warrant.

he then says he's coming to me as a neighbor, not a police officer. he says he appreciated me helping him find gear for his daughter to skate, and that he's never had problems with me and that he thinks it should be legal, but that i need to find somewhere else to do it, and that if it happens again he won't be so nice. i had the biggest heart attack of my life, my anxiety was ridiculous. even though it's only misdemeanor in my state i'm still not trying to deal with it.

"by having quickie sex with my wife after not doing it for more than four years. bit of a background, my wife was diagnosed four years ago with an illness affecting her kidneys which required her to undergo dialysis. this medical situation often leaves her weak and lethargic. the fact that she cannot also get pregnant  means we never had sexy time during this period.

fast forward about two weeks ago, we found a kidney donor and she had a successful operation. the protocol after the operation was that she needs to stay in an isolation house  with a private nurse to prevent her from getting sick so that her body will not reject the new kidneys. i'm only allowed to visit her for only a few hours just to bring in her  food  and supplies.

a couple of days ago i brought in her usual supplies and i was told that her private nurse would be coming in late due to personal reasons. so we were left alone in the room and after we made eye contact and i already knew what she wants. so i quickly showered excited about having our long awaited sexy time.

i knew she was also excited because when i came out of the bathroom she literally jumped on top of me to perform oral sex. while she was doing this she got a bit too excited and she playfully bit on my dick. surprised, i shouted and sat up so i can flip her to her back for my turn.

i started putting it in her and after a few pumps i noticed blood was coming out of her vag. i thought what bad luck she has her period but since we were already doing it i might as well finish. after a few seconds my dick started to get limp and i was thinking maybe it is psychological since i got turned off by the sight of her bloody period. at this time i already lost my erection and went to the bathroom to clean up.

while i was showering i noticed that i was having trouble getting rid of her blood. then i knew something was wrong because i could feel pain while washing up. i the checked the bottom of the shaft and discovered that i had a deep wound and i the one bleeding. she came inside the bathroom to help and fortunately the bleeding stopped. so i lost my erection since the blood in my dick was leaking out which i thought was her period.

we had a good laugh about it and declared that sexy time is delayed indefinitely until the wound healed.

once shooting a bunch of arrows into the shed became boring, i wanted to try something more exciting. so i yanked one of the arrows out of the shed, placed it on the string, aimed directly up into the sky and let it rip. sweet christ on a gas-powered unicycle, if robin hood or legolas were in attendance they would have congratulated me on shooting the arrow up that high and out of sight...and how stupid i was. so, like normal, we ran back inside the house and prayed no one would get killed. i ,for the life of me, don't know why i would do something so stupid but the consequences of my actions came to an actualization a mere seconds after hightailing it inside.

we heard the screeching brakes of a car a street behind my buddy's house. 

""shit...did i kill someone? a child? someone's pet?"", i thought to myself. 

a million different scenarios and thoughts were going through my mind before going out back to see the issue. we walked through the backyard of my buddy's neighbor's house to see this bald guy wearing a cargo shorts, a pepsi shirt and sunglasses that neo (the matrix) would wear to dodge bullets (obviously not arrows, as you will soon find out) in the middle of the street cussing and questioning what happened. we looked closer to see that the arrow i shot had stuck right into the roof of his pick up truck. it was only that one guy and he wasn't injured; a relief no one was seriously hurt or killed.

looking at the guy getting mad and questioning where and how the hell an arrow perfectly pierced the roof of his truck was enough to make me giggle which caught his attention.

after a few minutes of denying, arguing and me finally explaining that i was target practicing and ""slipped"", i agreed to pay him i think $100 (which was a lot for me at the time) and the neighbors who saw the whole commotion hated my buddy and i even more. the only reason the guy didn't call the cops was because i paid him cash right there and then. after he left, my friend tried to cheer me up by saying,

""well, that obviously wouldn't have happened to that guy if he was wearing a coke shirt. who the fuck likes pepsi?""


**tl;dr: shot an arrow directly into the sky without know where it would land. ended up sticking directly into the roof of some bald guys truck. paid him $100 (very broke at the time), to not call the cops.** ",4
"by accidentally activating the emergency lockdown alarm at my school on my second day as a student teacher. this happened yesterday. for those of you who don't know, pre-student teaching comes just one semester before student teaching. essentially, i have to observe in a classroom for 80 hours total. beyond observation, i will eventually teach some lessons. this was on my second day of observation.

on my first day my coordinating teacher (ct) had me simply observe her class, telling me that she would ease me into the way she does things before letting me teach a few things to her classes. 

as i was only 5 minutes into my second day, i was still just observing, sitting at her desk. now, this is important. she's having me sit at her official desk while she walks around the room and stands at an informal monitor setup. yippee, i feel important (not really).

so while she explains to her class what they will be doing for the day, i just watch and fiddle around a little at her desk. i was absent-mindedly running my hands along the bottom of the drawer of her desk, and just passing the time. i felt something with one of my fingers and pressed it in, without thinking it was anything other than a latch or something for the drawer. oh my fuck, was i wrong. now, the second i felt the thing i touched actually compress, i knew i fucked up.

cue the loudest fucking alarm you've ever heard in your life. now this isn't a constant tone, but rather a constant message, stating the following: 

""emergency. emergency. proceed to emergency lockdown. there is a threat in the building. law enforcement has been alerted and is on the way""

i damn near shit my pants, the students all start freaking out, most assuming it was an impromptu drill, and my ct immediately runs to the door, locks it, and shuts the blinds. 

instantly i try to motion to her that it was me, but she runs back to her computer. as it turns out, a school-wide email was also sent to each teacher, telling them exactly where the alarm was coming from. 

go figure, my ct saw that it was coming from her own room. she then finally turned to me and saw the look of horror on my face. she then spent the next 5 minutes trying to alert the main office that it was, in fact, a false alarm. in the first few minutes of the 5, a police officer arrived to confirm that it was just some dumbass (me) who had set it off.

i spent the rest of the day completely red-faced whenever near any of the faculty and i was appropriately poked fun at by all of them. 

at least i came away with a story that my university professor says is ""one that i doubt will ever be topped"".

tl;dr i pressed a button under my desk that i didn't know existed, setting off a school-wide alarm used for active shooters.

edit: thanks for the gold! it's my first. glad i could share a neat/funny story.

"work forcing me to use my mobile data for this new app they installed, threatening my job.. ive been working for a security company, for the last 4 years. two weeks ago they drop this new app they licenced without telling anybody and tells me ""it's a new policy, it's required, yadada, if you don't we'll find someone else."" 

the app requires location services, bluetooth, storage permissions, camera & flash. it uses a qr sticker for all the different check points for patrols and what not, which suck for obvious reasons. the worst contender is how much data it uses, during one shift is uses 100mb of data. that's easily a tenth of a lot of peoples monthly data and the extra use charges are criminally expensive and i'm not paid enough to afford anything more.
so i have been turning my data off during my work shifts and sending all the reports in when i'm at home on wifi, which i figure is completely reasonable since i don't want a more expensive phone bill because of my job.

no, i have their gate keeper come and scream at me. he basically holds me verbally hostage saying that i'm refusing to do my job and threatening to fire me once a shift now while refusing to listen to my reasoning or my attempts to find a way to make it work out for everyone involved.

this has mostly been a rant so tldr: my employeers made a sudden decision to force everyone onto an app that uses way too much data and provides no compensation for using personal resources.

i know california and illinois have laws that force buisnesses to compensate for personal expenses but i can't find anything for ~mystate~

here's the fuckup: i added it to my fucking story instead of sending it to my girlfriend. 

i didn't realise at all.

about half an hour later (a few minutes ago) my best friend dms me:

there it is. my fully erect dick in my hand, with the caption 'hi bb owo x'

i almost fucking died. ""why is there a dick on your story"" 
my only response to this? sending 'bruh' with fucked up spelling over and over before i finally head on to my story to delete that mess. luckily only my best friend saw it, and now we're even since i've seen his too.

in conclusion, r/tifu, i'm feeling a sweet mix of wanting to die with uncontrollably laughing.
don't take your friends for granted, they'll let you know if you accidentally put your dick on your instagram story. needless to say i will be buying my friend a pint and serving him with my fucking life until this blows over. what a bro.

in the same time period, asian and irish semi-slaves toiled in mines and railways and to this day not a cent in reparations has been made. there are no memorials to these people who helped build an empire. history books barely mention them. because the children of those who suffered didn't try to use the pain their parents and grandparents went through as a bargaining chip.",6
"by letting my friends slap my butt. this actually happened in 2015. it was summer and my best friend was in town, which meant lounging in the pool the entire day and drinking. we got really drunk and decided on playing a game called ""tapão"" (in english it means something like ""big slap""). the game basically consists in drawing a bunch of cards while counting 1, 2, 3 etc. until the card matches the number - that's when you slap the cards as fast and strong as you can so you won't be the last one.

so. i have a big butt. and my friends love endorsing that fact. my best friend, then, had an amazing idea: play the game on my butt.

i'm super drunk, so why not? my butt is great. i lay belly down on the floor and they proceed to play it on my butt. when the slaps begin, though, i feel excruciating pain. nothing like a normal hit on the asscheeks. it feels like there's something raw in between them, like they're slapping over open flesh. i cry out loud every time they hit me, but don't protest against it since everyone is having fun with my suffering.
it finishes, other friend offers her butt and life goes on.

but the pain never stops. if something, it increases. the next day i can't sleep because i'm in so much pain, can't sit down, can't do anything but cry and lie on the bed. they take me to the hospital.

it's a fucking pilonidal cyst. my friends ""activated"" the inflammation by slapping me on the butt with the strength of an angry gorilla several times. i proceed to spend the next fifteen days waiting for the abscess to get big enough so the doctor can squeeze it out. worst pain i've ever felt in my entire life.

tldr; i let my friends slap my butt so we could have a good laugh, the impact caused soreness on a pilonidal cyst near my ass and i had to go through excruciating pain in order to get it out. never. again.",4
"how do i convince my mom to not be tricked by a house flipping scam?. so my mom and dad want to spend $20k on a house flipping training program: https://www.thelist.com/33978/untold-truth-flipping-vegas/. my parents are retirement age, currently unemployed, renting ($2k/mo, cheap in socal) and has $x0k in savings. she has a real estate license and has sold a few houses over the years, so i think she feels somewhat more knowledgeable than the average joe.

my googling reveals that although the seminars and classes themselves are real (though questionable in practical value), it appears to be a way to sucker people into borrowing programs to fund home purchases.

i've tried to convince my mom that this is a shady sounding business and worried they'll blast thru all of their savings. my siblings and i are willing to help support their monthly expenses, find them a home to save money or invest in a property together. it seems to be a matter of pride that she wants to feel productive, successful and not reliant on us. i understand her desire but ironically, odds are that she'll fail and make things worse

"by tipping the delivery driver. today i decided to order a pizza from papa john, it cost around $20 including delivery and tax and i decided to give a $3 tip. i only had $22 in cash and i had one of those $1 coins and i decided i would use that so i could give a decent tip. when the delivery guy got here i grabbed my money including what i thought was the $1 coin and i give it to him and took my pizza then sat down to eat.

before i can continue you need to know a lot of context. several years ago i was suicidal, my family's used to go on these yearly trips to california which i would always beg and plead not to go on. thankfully that year my mom gave me a choice go on the california trip or go with my dad. my dad was going to new mexico to help one of his friends fix up one of his old properties so he could sell it for more, if i were to go with my dad it would essentially be 3 days of hard labor and i wouldn't get paid either but if i went with my mom i would spend 5 days in california, eat out for every meal and go to disney land. i chose to go with my dad. 

my dads friend was in the navy, i think his rank before he got out was ""chief petty officer"" or some other very high rank. anyways, after the 3 days i spent there helping them, it came to the end of the last day and my dad's friend offered to pay me, i said no because my dad said i wasn't going to get paid, my dad's friend and my dad said that we're proud of me for my integrity, being honest and sticking to the original agreement. my dad gave me $100 but my dad's friend gave me a challenge coin. to 12 year old me $100 was more than i would see in 3 years let alone 3 days, but i didn't care about the money, to me, the challenge coin was the bigger reward. because i felt depressed at this period in my life i felt that i was worthless and wasn't capable of anything let alone something worthy of praise from a high ranking officer in navy. after i got this coin i used it as an example as to why i mattered and that i was worth something, and that i should keep on going, a year or two after i woke up one day and my depression was gone, and soon after that i forgot about the challenge coin.

back to the present, i had finished eating my pizza and i went back to my room, when i noticed something shiny on my dresser, it was the $1 coin. at first i felt bad because i thought i didn't give the delivery driver a good tip, but i definitively remember giving the driver a golden coin, it took me a second but i then realized that i gave him the challenge coin instead of the $1 coin instead. after that i cried for a little bit because of how much that coin meant to me and now it's gone forever. 

tl:dr i accidentally gave the delivery driver a challenge coin that i got from a high ranking officer that helped me with my depression instead of a $1 coin.

edit: update... i got the coin back!!!
https://imgur.com/a/2cliqxx

edit 2: i got the coin back by calling the place and before i could finish telling the story they immediately knew what was going on and they sent the guy to bring it back, and i managed to scrounge up $5 so i could actually give him a decent tip. when he got to my house he gave me the coin back and i gave him the $5.

edit 3 because some people can't read and i can't type: i got the pizza at 9pm my time, i realized what had happened at 11pm, then posted this at midnight, i then went to bed woke up in the morning and then called papa johns and got my coin back. i also only had an extra $3 that could give for a tip, and yes... i know a $3 tip is pretty mediocre.",4

"by accidentally putting ""porn"" on every computer in our elementary school computer lab.. this happened over 12 years ago, it was the start of fifth grade.

my class went into the computer lab for the first time that year. we got our fifth grade login info which the entire class shared.

after we got logged in, i was curious to see if my old fourth grade login still worked. it did! so i spent my time in the lab goofing off on the old account. (what i didn't realize is that the new fourth grade class would still be using this login.) being the immature 10 year old i was, i google image searched the word ""fart"" and found this lovely photo:

https://imgur.com/a/fdphcg2(https://imgur.com/a/fdphcg2)

i thought it was hilarious, so i set it as the background and giggled about it with some friends. the photo didn't take up too much of the background, it was a small picture in the middle surrounded by the generic blue windows background color. i was able to hide it pretty easily with a small window or by pulling up the background settings. instead of changing it back to normal before we left, i decided to leave it and see if it would still be there the next time we went back to the lab.

the next time we went to the lab was maybe a few days or a week later. i made sure to snag the same computer i was on the last time. i logged in with the fourth grade info, and sure enough, the photo was still there. i had intended to switch it back to normal...

only this time, it had stretched to fit the screen. i was quite surprised to see the giant ass on my monitor, so i logged out as quickly as i could. i had heard about ""porn"" and i figured i could probably get in huge trouble if my teacher saw what i did (10 year old me thought ""porn"" simply meant pictures of naked people). looking back, i could have easily switched it very quickly. i was an idiot and i guess i didn't think anyone else would ever see it.

fast forward a few days or a week, and i had completely forgot about my nasty background. we were in class doing something quietly when one of the other fifth grade teachers came into our room. i heard him whispering to my teacher, and i heard one word that nearly gave me a heart attack: ""motorcycle"". i realized that someone had seen what i had done. sometime that day, i had seen one of my ""friends"" walking down the hallway with the principal. she was with me the day i set the background photo. i was so afraid that she had ratted me out. the suspense ate away at me that day. i hardly ate any lunch. at recess, i confided in another friend about what i had seen and heard. we decided that no matter what, no one would ever know it was me, since there are no cameras in the lab and we all used the same login. she convinced me that my other ""friend"" wouldn't have told on me. still, i had never been more nervous in my life.

later that day, i finally got called into the office. it was actually kind of a relief. i knew i was in trouble but i also thought that i could explain myself. i knew it was bad, but i had honestly meant no harm by it... until i learned that when the fourth grade class had logged in, my nasty background was on every computer. i imagined the giant ass popping up, one by one, as the students logged in. i thought about how my fourth grade teacher (one of my favorite teachers) witnessed it all and now knew it was me who had done it. i don't remember much about the conversation i had with the principal, but i know there was a lot of crying on my part. i'm sure she thought that i had manually logged into every single computer and changed the backgrounds.

i ended up getting suspended from school for one day. (i had to confirm with my mom that it would not be on my permanent record) edit: permanent records are not a real thing, a better way to phrase that would've been ""i had to confirm with my mom that permanent records don't exist"". i think it was a made up thing to try to keep kids in line

&#x200b;

tl;dr

i set this photo(https://imgur.com/a/fdphcg2) as the background on a school computer, left it there like an idiot, and since the computers were linked, it set to every computer in the lab for all of the fourth graders to see.

"kohl's charge dispute nightmare. so someone got into our kohl's shopping account and ordered $1000+ worth of stuff and had it shipped to our house.  it was an odd thing, why would they do that?  i called and disputed the charges as i didn't really want the goods and they opened a case and said more information would be forthcoming.  

a week or so later i get a letter saying that they have determined that the charges were legitimate and that they have closed the case.  

in the mean time i have $1000 worth of stuff in my house waiting for ""further instructions""

i call back in and am a little frustrated at this point.  they explain that what the perps are after was the kohl's reward cash, which also goes into your shopping account as well as gets emailed to you.  

i do recall this from the first call, she said that she was going to ""get the kohls cash quick""... but that was all that was said at that point.

so i reiterate that i did not make the charges but wanted to know what i am supposed to do now.  

they said to just return the stuff to the store get my refund and be on my merry way.  easy enough... other than the inconvenience of doing so.

this is where it goes bad.

i return the stuff to the store... but they can't give me full credit for it because... someone spent the $200 kohl's cash already.  

cue the next phone call while the store manager (who was awesome i might add) works with me trying to resolve the issue... this isn't the first time they have seen this issue, at this store just the week prior they had another fraud return.  i'm guessing there is an exploit on their website somewhere that people have gotten into or something, they didn't get into our email or anything else... someone needs better site security

i digress.

anyway, turns our that the cash was indeed spent, and they track it down to a store literally across the country from me.  guy says ""no problem, i will put back in the dispute and they will clear up the $200 no problem... unfortunately i can't do it, i have to reopen the ticket with the original person running the dispute""

i'm starting to gather that this ""original person"" is a real moron.

ok, so i'm happy again.  things will get patched up no problem right?

wrong.

i get my bill a week or so later, the $200 is still on there and now they want me to pay for it.

i call in again.

this time i'm rather mad, i've been kind long enough but this is going on 5 weeks now.

turns out original person decided that since the kohl's cash was indeed delivered to our email address that we must have spent it ourselves... somehow teleporting across the country to do so, and also forgetting that the perps had access to our shopping account and got the cash info as it is instantly delivered with your purchase.

so now i open the dispute again, we spelled out the problem for mr./mrs original person what the problem is, explaining that it was spent in a different state, and that the shopping account which also contained the cash was compromised.

what other recourse do i have?  this stupid card doesn't have a visa/mc logo or anything on it.  i'm about to shred the whole thing and let it sit out there and dispute it at the credit agency level.

kohl's get your act together and secure your dumb website!

i did run the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ search, great idea btw.  one hit showed up but that site was only an email database, no passwords attached to it, leading me back to the idea that it is possibly an exploit on their website.  if you read down through the replies, it seems like it is an organized group doing this based on the types of items being purchased (rugs in several) they group that hit me also had the ability to spam our inbox trying to hide the order confirmation email among the garbage messages, no everyone has that ability.

so basically, he wasn't immediately diagnosed with a mental illness (as it was explained to me he's on the older end to start showing symptoms so he went to a lot of doctors). at some point early on he had an mri (i think) on his brain *and they found a fucking tumor in there*. so yeah that's fucking insane and terrifying and yeah i was really glad i didn't hear that over the phone.

so - here's the thing. the tumor is confirmed definitely 100% *not* the reason he hallucinated steve the dog and why i'm not calling it a real twist (sorry). it was too small and not in the right place - he didn't have *any* symptoms from it, not even headaches. 

so basically the tumor was a huge coincidence, which totally blows my mind and i can't stop thinking about it even months later. because if he *hadn't* had those hallucinations then he wouldn't have had the mri so soon and it wouldn't have been caught so early and then who knows what would have happened to him right? scary shit. get checked out regularly, guys. 

oh also it wasn't cancerous but it would have still been dangerous unchecked. they were able to totally remove it though because of how early it was caught so yeah, really lucky. thanks for looking out steve. you're a good boy. 

i know people want to know what actually caused the hallucinations but i really don't know. i think i mentioned before that i'm not asking for specific details (not my business). sorry guys but i'd feel like shit if i was him and i didn't have the option to tell people really personal shit like that myself. i'm sure he'll tell me when he's ready. 

anyway gonna start wrapping this up (thanks for sticking with me), but i actually stayed in ca for a while so i can definitely say that after brain surgery, therapy, lots of meds, and everything else he's doing great - you know, all things considered. still dunno when he's coming home but i don't think it should be too much longer. 

i got to visit him a lot when i was out there though, which was awesome because it was proof he was really *okay*, you know? at first he didn't want to see me because he was kinda embarrassed i think, but i was like stfu it's not like you don't have shit on me too and he got over it. he's also on board with getting a real steve, so i've started looking for the perfect dog for him to come home to. or maybe i'll wait for him. i dunno. still deciding.  

so i guess that's it. thanks again for all the great advice, help, and support through this crazy ride. if this makes it to bola i'll see you there. ",2

"because of my boyfriend's butt. nsfw. so if you can't tell from my username, i am a huge fan of the booty. specifically, i am a fan of the male buttocks. always have been. always will be. and it just so happens my bf has a rocking badonkadonk.

any we're cuddling on saturday morning like couples do, and i get around to groping his butt. poking, squeezing, light slapping, you get the picture. anyway eventually i get the bright idea to faceplant into his left butt cheek.

unfortunately in my ass molestation induced horniness, i miscalculated his cushion for the pushin relative to my velocity.

i smacked nose first into his butt so hard i went straight through to his hip bone. cue me running to the bathroom with an epic ass induced nosebleed. my boyfriend at this point, sighing at my perpetual clumsiness, decided to call it a morning to get tea. thus ended our cuddle session for the day.

edit: buttocks not buttox. there is not a draft animal living in his pants.

tldr: gave myself a nosebleed by faceplanting into my boyfriend's butt.",4

"update me 18m and 9 other friends 18m on holiday in spain. one friend won't pay for the villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. shall we kick him out? update. okay so i listened to everyone who commented, and discussed all of it with the rest of my friends. 

thank you all for the advice. 

we were all upstairs around a table and some chairs / sofa. we called him upstairs, and i think he knew what was coming because he seemed already pissed off. 

i started off by explaining by trying to calmly explain the situation with him having to pay, but then was immediately cut off by someone saying ""yo you have to pay us £250 for the villa."" obviously he got pissed at this. 

we were arguing / discussing / whatever it was non - stop for well over half an hour. it was kinda heated not gonna lie. 

he handled it really well, and i admit it was really sly of us to all sort of ""gang up"" on him, because i've been in that situation before and it feels really bad. so i tried to keep everything calm. 

basically there was a bit more to the story, since the 2 people organising this trip to spain, basically didn't fill the rest of us in on some essential stuff. 

like for example, the amount mark got refunded was only £100, whereas the price of the villa was £250. but the thing is, the 2 people organising it apparently ""agreed"" that it's fine for him to stay, and this is where the confusion comes in, because they say they didn't. essentially, when we were still planning the holiday, mark apparently already asked these 2 people if it's okay for him to cancel the apartment and come in our villa, and they said yes but none of them set prices and shit straight from the start. 

mark's point is, he's taking harry's spot, so why should he pay, since, if he wasn't there, the refundable deposit would go to harry either way? 

this is probably confusing and it's hard to explain since it was a very lengthy and heated engagement so i'm not sure how to explain absolutely everything, so that's the jist of it. 

harry, who cancelled, was going to get all of the refundable deposit. we asked mark to pay for staying in the villa, and he said no. 

we asked him in many different ways, and he raised some valid points, but still said no. also, he has thousands of pounds, so paying that wasn't the problem. 

he just didn't want to pay. 

so, we listened to all of you, and told him he can't sleep in the villa if he's not paying because it's not fair on everyone else. he was pissed, and we even had to ring some of our friends back home to clear up some more shit that was there due to poor organising and lack of communication. 

so, i suggested instead of £250 he pay £145, which is how much it would cost to stay in the villa for the remainder of the holiday. the reason i said this is because we did bring it up with him 3 days into the holiday, so it's unfair of us to expect him to pay the full amount. 

he didn't want to pay it. eventually, and i mean eventually, we decided that he's going to stay in the apartment that those 2 other people rented out that is near our villa. he will pay them for staying in the apartment, as it's cheaper than our villa, only around £100. 

everything is awkward as fuck and i'm fearing that the holiday may be ruined because of this. i felt so bad after for all of us ""ganging up"" on him, because that's pretty much what it was. i've been on the other side, and i know how it feels like. 

so, i offered to pay the £45 for him, and he only pays £100. at this point he was packing his suitcase and everything so he still declined and said he didn't want to stay with people who didn't want him there anyway. 

we all tried to stress how it's not personal, and we aren't doing it on purpose. i felt bad after so i went to him individually and just said sorry essentially for all of us ganging up on him, and we aren't doing it just for the sake of it. 

so he packed, and he's staying elsewhere, like you guys said he should. so thank you. 

in the meantime we just went to the beach to try kill the tension and any awkwardness between us, it's working slowly but surely. 

thanks again and happy holidays to everyone :)",7
"for wanting to send my teen daughter to a weight loss camp?. my daughter (15) is 5'6 and the last time she weighed herself at the doctor's office she was at 238lbs. she is morbidly obese.

she was always a chubby kid who loved food and hated activity no matter how much her dad and i tried to get her to dance, play sports, go on walks with our dog etc. she would refuse. i regret not taking her to a nutritionist earlier, but i thought that she would go into puberty and her weight would eventually be okay. unfortunately, when she was 11 her dad and i decided to get a divorce. no special reason, it just wasn't working. we coparent well, we're friendly, we go on trips with out daughter etc., but the divorce impacted her negatively at first. 

she started gaining a lot of weight around that time so we decided to take her to a nutritionist who recommended therapy for her. she initially lost about 15lbs but she was already very dependent on food. now, she's a food addict. her emotional eating was something she used to cope with the divorce until she adjusted, but now it's all about compensating for not having friends, compensating for not being ''pretty'', compensating for not being liked by boys etc. 

she still goes to therapy regularly, she doesn't suffer from depression or another health condition that might cause her weight gain, she is simply addicted to food and at her vulnerable age, mentioning her weight to her makes her very upset and uncomfortable. her dad and i both know this and it's been causing arguments between us. i'm a very active, fit person and i try to lead by example - no junk food allowed in the house, i cook as much as i can or i get healthy meal delivery - and this makes me the bad guy.

she's into the whole body acceptance movement and she sold the story to her dad who now allows her to raid his pantry and they eat junk together just so he wouldn't upset her because she's daddy's little girl. he's happy that he gets to be the good guy and i'm the villain who doesn't want her daughter to settle because i want her to live past 35. i encourage her to love herself, i want her to embrace how amazing she is but i don't want her to accept her condition as something normal that can't be changed. i'm tired seeing how miserable she is because of her weight and i'm tired of thinking about all the diseases that could kill her. 

i found a great weight management treatment facility (*edited instead of camp because it's very different from the infamous fat camps) for teens that's 6 hours away, i've done my research but her dad doesn't want to sign for her to go there from january to july. we can visit her and she can come home once a month, she can go to school there, make friends and get healthy. he says that i'm being a selfish asshole and that our daughter doesn't want to go. she told me that she will think about it but i think that her dad is loving his role as her superhero because they've bonded in the past months, and will encourage her not to go.

aita?

__edit:__ lots of repetitive question and comments. please look through my comment history, thank you.

__edit2:__ again, i've explained everything about this treatment facility, her current therapy and approach to her eating disorder, the fact that the choice is ultimately hers, yes we do have a dog and no she doesn't want to walk him, no this isn't a quick fix, no i don't think my daughter hates me.

__edit3:__ i sound like a broken record, put please read through my comments before asking the same things over and over! there's a word limit here and obviously not everything fits in the post. the facility does have therapists, specialists, doctors and all types of health professionals. they do have ed programs that she would be a part of and she would be in touch with her current therapist because she has a hard time opening up to new people, so that would help her. i double and triple checked everything and talked to so many parents and employees, but it's ultimately her choice. my fear is that her dad will cloud her judgment by bribing her with food.

__edit4:__ thank you guys for all of your responses. i've received a lot of great advice, your own experience with ed, personal stories, support and empathy. i appreciate all of it. i'll no longer be replying to comments because i find myself trying too hard to reach people who are twisting my words and using them against me. maybe i'll post an update within the next few weeks when something happens, but things definitely will change around here. again, thank you all!",3
"when you have a laptop for college, make sure you make two accounts. one for studying and one for all other things.. a clean desktop and lack of games (you can remove them per user) can really limit distractions. put a website blocker on the browser of the account for studying, this will prevent you even more from procrastinating.

"fl 4 year old son went on play date - $20k tv got broken but kids were unsupervised so don't know if it was my kid or his, owner wants me to pay half. surely there's a limit on this kind of thing?. my son went on a play date to some people we're friendly with through pre-k. while at their house, this guy's $20k tv got broken. there were no adults present so they don't know who broke it (his kid or mine). he says ""lets's just split the difference"".

putting aside the fact that this jackass had kids around a $20k tv in the first place, surely there's a limit on how much i would have to pay out?

if this went to court, would he be responsible for the full amount as my kid was in his care?

could a judge say ""a reasonable tv costs $1000 so give him $500?""

if worst comes to worst, could i claim this on my home insurance?

"tn my landlord had a break-in a few months ago where every tennant's financial information was stolen. now i'm getting letters about owing $2900 on a credit card.. back in february, the apartment complex where i live had an office break-in. at the time were assured that nothing of value was stolen and we had nothing to worry about. last week, i got a letter from a collection agency stating i owed them around $2900 on a credit card i've never had. the account address returns to florida, it's obviously not me. checked my credit, sure enough about 3 weeks after the break-in the account was opened.

according to one of the managers, applications for around 300 people were stolen. some were former tenants and people just applying, but along with it all the current tenants had their information stolen as well. the only reason i know about this is because there are at least 3 other people in this complex who have received letters from the same collection agency over the past couple of weeks. one of them put two and two together and figured the office probably wasn't telling the whole truth about the break-in. he went to the police department and received a copy of the police report through foia and it turns out all of our applications were kept in an unlocked file cabinet in the break room.

"i (29m) showed up to my gf's (25f) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am.. this is a throwaway for the obvious reasons. 
i had plans to hang out with my gf after her class tonight around 9-10pm. so texted her something nice around that time to let her know i was thinking of her, and see when she would be done. no response. she texts me hii a couple hours later, i responded hey what's up. at this point a little upset she had blown me off for hours past the time she said she would hit me up after class.
no response again. this time for the rest of the night. i was starting to get worried bc i know she leaves campus late and it can be sketchy in that area sometimes. i text her and call her a couple more times no response. 

at this point i'm definitely worried and text her i'm gonna stop by to make sure she's all good, she's a girl and lives alone and just 5 min from me. so i swing by and all the lights are on, i walk up to the front door and knock.

she comes out looking surprised. steps outside, oddly. i say what's up i was worried you weren't ok i never heard back from you and you kinda bailed on our plans. she then says oh sorry i've been hanging with some friends from school. so i ask is someone in there right now, and she tries to casually play off ya there is a guy from class over we've been hanging out talking about our class. 
(mind you, it's 2am. )

she then asks me to come in and if i want to meet him. i say yes. i come in and meet this guy who looks a bit startled. introduce myself and then they start catching me up on what they were talking about. my gf is acting pretty odd like super causal that the fact i just showed up at 130am after she's been ignoring me and there's a random guy i don't know there... she's acting like it's no big deal. 
within 20 min i decide i'm going home, and ask her to walk me out. i then ask her to make the guy leave bc there's no reason to be there that late. she says no we were in the middle of a conversation...
i try explaining to her this isn't cool with me and makes me uncomfortable and she doesn't seem to care one bit. she just says, i'm not gonna argue with you another this while someone is right here, we can talk tomorrow. and then walks back inside. 

i tried not to make a scene and be respectful of her house, while still letting her know it wasn't cool. am i crazy or are those serious red flags and am i being naive here? i have to talk to her tomorrow and im not sure how to approach this. 

tldr; showed up at 130am to gf house, another guy from her class was over there i didn't know. she played it cool and we all talked and then i left and went home and he was still there at 2am.

i talked to him. he didn't want to get me a tank because it would cost more money than the sea monkeys and he'd spent all his cash on weed. he didn't want to charge something full price from the store  to his card, and didn't have cash for a used tank from craigslist. he thought i'd buy that it was a compromise, apparently.

my dad went and got a copy of the deeds from our property and the landlocked property. it turns out that the landlocked property has an easement from the third-party property i showed in my last post. he does not have one through our property. the seller of the landlocked property is telling people it is through our property though because we have a road and the other one does not. we have informed the person who we believe will buy it and he was hostile, but he understood he had no grounds to use our property. i'm hoping this will be the end of it.

"dad (53) died a year ago and mom (58) is unemployed and spent all her savings. we are in massachusetts though i'm not sure what other information i should be including here. but i'm asking for advice on what i can do to help in this situation. 

she was a stay at home mom and only has a high school diploma. she has off and on part time job experience but nothing full time within the last 20 years. 

she's frantically searching for a job and even has an interview as an office assistant next week but is freaking out that she can't pay the july bills. 

i moved back in with her and am starting a funded phd position in september at which point i can contribute more directly to the finances. i'm working now but not making enough to contribute much more than paying the water bill or her phone bill every month.

i guess i'm here to ask people more experienced than me what we can do to make sure my mom can live at least comfortably from now on.

edit: some more information that seems pertinent is that 

1. she owns the house
2. she knows she needs to work but is more worried about building up a retirement account 
3. i will be contributing around 500 a month 
4. we live in a lower cost of living area than boston

"went to hospital, they refused to even attempt to run my claim through insurance, now i have collections agencies calling me for $10,000! (us). so i went to the hospital back in february for reasons i will not discuss here.  i have great health insurance through my employer that does cover hospital stays.  i didn't yet have the card at the time of the stay because i just got the insurance and they hadn't mailed it to me yet, but i was covered during that time.

i have since been on the phone with the hospitals billing department and my insurer.  the insurer says i am covered and the hospital needs to submit a claim.  the hospital keeps claiming they don't have my information despite me giving them the card number over the phone and even having a representative from the insurer talk to them in a 3-way call.

now the bill has gone to the collections agency and hospital refuses to even try to submit a claim to the insurer, stating that its up to the collections agency and then rudely hanging up on me.  the collections agency says i have to take it up with the hospital when i explain the situation to them.

now i have people from india constantly blowing up my phone and i don't want this bullshit to drag down my credit score (so far it has not appeared on my credit karma reports).  can someone please tell me how to deal with this?",10

"the ""white man"" isn't keeping you from success. (i'm black). it's quite draining nowadays trying to keep up with what i'm supposed to be outraged about as a black person. one day it's some police brutality incident. the next it's a white girl wearing braided hair. now it's kanye supporting our president \(i don't dislike the president btw\). it's really annoying tbh.

i grew up in a single parent home. while my dad was in and out of prison, my mom made minimum wage and was on and off of drugs. i went to decent schools \(30&#37; black/white/spanish 10&#37; asian\), but always pushed myself to do well in school to live a successful life in the future. even still, today i've made something of myself and started a thriving business.  i am self\-sufficient and beat the ""odds"". i've been pulled over at least 30 times and been to jail for minor infractions \(marijuana, suspended license\) a bit earlier in life. i've never been shot or beat up by a cop nor do i know anyone who knows anyone who knows anyone whose been a victim of police brutality.

my point is that, i found a way out the most unfit situations and so can anyone else. i was dealt a sh\*tty hand, but didn't allow that to hinder me. i think it's unfair to blame the government or ""white men"" for your lack of success. though there are many prejudices that may affect how people interact with you, your skin color will not hinder you from succeeding in life. it's simply an excuse for the failed. opportunities are plentiful for all races of people. some of my white classmates are flipping burgers and drugged out of their minds. some are doctors and lawyer. stop waiting for a handout and blaming slavery for your lack of success. you were born with the same opportunities as everyone else.

"for taking a shot at my professor?. i've never done anything to my professor ever. in a 8 week course i've never missed a class once, and we meet multiple times a week. 

anyway i'm married and have a young son who has a medical issue. 

basically let me explain the backstory first. i do not have a good relationship with this professor in general and don't care for her. she doesn't answer emails, answers a question with a question, isn't helpful or understanding, hypocritical (you'll see why in a minute). 

i informed her a week ahead of time that i wouldn't be attending class one day because no one is able to watch my son literally. usually my sister watches him or his grandparents. my sister had a doctors appointment that she can't reschedule so she can't. 

i don't trust him with not known to family babysitters, atleast not yet and would have to get used to it. 

basically, i don't like this professor. there is supplementary material that she was supposed to upload to blackboard and hasnt done it for weeks and has broken her promise to me multiple times. 

anyway, i was talking about missing class because i would assume their would be a quiz. i could get the notes from someone but can't do the quiz in class obviously. 

she said too bad basically, and when i get in the real world i'll have to be more professional. i tried to explain the situation, but to no avail. she said i couldn't bring my son (ok). i said i would take it in the testing center a few hours later and she said no, no, no. i have to learn how to be professional. 

so i didn't really care, class is about to end since the course is accelerated. i said ""yeah, i'm sure you know a ton about being a professional. taking weeks to grade assignments, not answering emails, breaking promises and going back on your word consistently, you're the last person i'd want to get advice on being a professional from""

my husband said to be careful, she could be spiteful and mess with like my grade. i mean, why is she giving me a lecture about being a professional when she's demonstrated she's the furthest thing from one herself?",3

"for keeping my father's love child a secret?. about 22 years ago my dad had an affair and got his mistress pregnant. he confessed all to my mom who responded ""take care of your responsibility but i never want to hear about this again."" so my dad did just that- he paid child support and had a relationship with my brother but spoke of it to no one except his attorney, his mother, and sister. he claims  a lapse in judgement and has been faithful and committed to my mom since.

5 years ago i ran into my aunt and nana having lunch with a teenage boy. they seemed uneasy but asked if i wanted to join them and i really hit it off with nicholas. he was cool as shit and we had a lot in common even though i was 22 and he was 16. i asked my nana  how they knew him and she brushed me off. later that day my dad asked me to meet up and told me that nicky was my half brother and the whole story. all these years that we thought my dad was working, out of town on business or on a guy's trip he was usually with nicky. at first i was really angry but then i felt really bad for him and nicky and told him i wanted to have relationship with my brother. he said ok and seemed happy about it but asked that i not tell my siblings or let my mom know because it would devastate her. i played along for a few years. i was at nicky's graduation, took him on his senior trip  backpacking in europe, and helped him move into his college dorm. we're as close as if we grew up together.

i recently got engaged and in planning the wedding decided i wanted nicky as a groomsmen with my other brothers. i told my dad and he agreed it was time to end the charade and my mom would have to face it. so he told my mom and my mom called me and begged me not to let the family secret out and how that was a hard time for her and she can't face my father's son. i felt bad but i think that my brother is also innocent in this and that my mom needs to be an adult and face reality. so we told my siblings. there have been a lot of emotions over the past few months but my siblings  love nicky and he's really happy to have brothers and sisters and fits right in. my dad seems relieved to have all his kids together and not to be keeping a secret. my mom spent the entire summer at our beach house and still seems to be in denial.

her sister (my aunt) says i'm an asshole bc i should've stayed out of it. 2 of my 4 siblings think i'm an asshole for keeping the secret for so long. they think its unfair that i got to make so many memories with nicky and they didn't get to. one of them is around nicky's age and is really bummed she didn't know she had a brother so closer to her age. i think they have lots of time to make memories with him now and that i was in a tough place and made a hard decision but that doesn't make me an asshole.

&#x200b;

just a few edits to clarify some things:

1. my dad hasn't been going behind my mom's back to see nicky. when i spoke to my mom, she indicated that she knew that my dad had a relationship with him and my dad said that he told her during the ""i don't want to hear about it talk"" that he told her that he couldn't just throw money at the child but not be involved and my mom said she knew he couldn't. while he never said ""i'm going to nicky's soccer game tonight and won't be home for dinner"" my mom told me sister during a talk a couple months ago that she almost always knew when my dad was with nicky. 
2. my wedding isn't until next year (next october) and if my mom still hasn't dealt with the situation and feels that she can be part of the day, then we will push it back a little more if we need to. my so fully supports me in this. i wanted the secret to come out now so that we weren't dealing with it right before the wedding and nicky wasn't being introduced as our brother at the wedding. that's a total asshole move and never occured to me to do 
3. there have been a lot of comments about me not loving my mom and being callous towards her. this was not my intention. i love my mom. she is wonderful and loving and i don't want to cause her any pain but i also do think that my parents made the wrong decision 22 years ago to keep nicky a secret and that she's had 22 years to come to terms with his existence. no one sees her as someone to pity. if anything, everyone's respect for my dad has gone down a few notches for being unfaithful, however, my mom had/has a chance to act with grace and compassion and i think that is what most people will see: my dad is the louse and my mom is the saint for staying with him, forgiving him, and being tolerant of nicky. 
4. i know i talked a lot about my dad being happy and some negative comments made about that. my dad is not overjoyed that my mom is hurting but he is relieved to not be living two lives anymore. despite his infidelity, he is an upstanding guy and it bothered him to continue lying to his children and he hated sneaking around. 
5. yes, my sister was 3 months old when my dad confessed the affair. the affair lasted about 6 months and began around a time when my parents were living apart and continued for a couple months after they reunited (they reunited right before my sister was born). their separation had nothing to do with infidelity or lying.
6. my mother has not been alone at the beach house. my dad has been with her a lot of the time and each of us siblings has visited her. she's also had friends staying with her. 

also, just because i don't want people to think that my parents have a bad marriage that my mom has suffered through all these years for us kids-they don't. they are loving and affectionate. my dad adores my mother and she adores him. she has told us that she stayed with my dad then because she loves him and that the affair was out of character for him and she didn't believe he would do it again. she does not want a divorce and everyone really is trying to help her through it as much as possible.",3
"homeless at 18. yesterday my mom kicked me out.

we've had a poor relationship for most of my life, and she feels that whenever something good happens to her i ruin it in some way. for the past year leading up to this i've rarely been in the house, just as a way to try and avoid the constant conflict. i've been in therapy for some time and it's taken this year to realize that the way she treats me is ""abusive,"" and my constant paranoia in my own home was not normal.  while i was packing my things yesterday she said many hurtful things, telling me i'll 'never amount to anything', she 'never wanted me', and i'm 'the most selfish and dramatic person she's ever met'.

before this happened, i've felt i have a lot of things going for me. i'm currently in university, an honours program i'm going into my second year with. i worked a well paying job as a pharmacy technician in high school that allowed me to buy my own car in full, now only needing to worry about insurance. currently, i am working a casual part-time retail job, a decision i had made to lessen stress so i could focus on studies. come september i will be commuting to school once again (45 minute drive away) and presumably my hours at my job will go down.

right now my boyfriend's family has taken me in, so i have somewhere to sleep. however, i worry about becoming a nuisance in some way like i was to my own parents. i have another 3 years of university to get through, so i will need to find my own place at some point.

my biggest fear right now is that i'm going to lose everything. i have an education plan, a job (albeit, not anything special), and a car, but how can i keep this up with costs? especially considering the eventual need to find my own place to live.

my savings are fairly minimal. i have about $450 in my account right now, and about $1600 tucked away in another account i don't have a card to right now.

brave is a fire fighter, parent of 3, walking into a burning building to save people they dont even know. cliche but real, so call that fucking person brave. doing something for the greater good against all odds and better instincts is bravery. eating a gallon of blue bell and squeezing your fat ass into a bikini and flaunting your rolls for all to see is not brave by any stretch of the imagination. brave is now becoming as misused and overused as the word awesome. like does that new shirt you bought really inspire awe or is it just a decent shirt?

"for cutting off close friends that ruined my birthday.. let's start by saying i don't have a lot of friends. i organized a birthday dinner and invited my best friend and her girlfriend (who is also a close friend). i asked them weeks before the date and then confirmed a few days before hand both times they said they were definitely coming. keep in mind it was my best friends birthday a few weeks before mine, and i made sure i attended a gaming night she hosted in celebration, and bought her a thoughtful gift. 

i made a reservation at my favorite restaurant, arrived 15 minutes early on the night to make sure i was there when they arrived. half an hour passed and i thought it was strange they weren't there/i hadn't heard from them. they were both active on facebook so i messaged them asking when they were coming. they both read my messages and did not respond. i sat at my favorite restaurant eating my favorite food alone on my birthday. i did not hear from them at all regarding the dinner (not to mention they did not even wish me a happy birthday) and then in the following weeks they invite me to a christmas dinner they're hosting for a group of friends. of course after what's happened i decline the invite and instantly get a message asking why i'm not coming. 

i am furious. i am somebody that forgives people for literally everything, and i feel like that's the reason they're shocked i haven't just got over it. as well as anger i can't help but feel incredibly guilty for declining their invite. am i being an asshole if i just cut these people off?

"for blaming my 14yo sister's pregnancy on my parents?.   

i am a teenage girl living in italy with extremely religious parents, and a now 26 week pregnant 14 year old sister.

my parents raised us with no knowledge of sex, and did everything they could to ensure that we couldn't learn about sex in school (such as removing us from school in days sex education was performed, and going as far as to remove me from class whenever i had biology in my later school years in case i got any ideas), and they never told us about it either. we were always taught that sex is for married couples who want to have children, and so the only real knowledge of sex i had was from my friends and media.

my parents think i am still a virgin despite being with my current boyfriend for two years, but this is not true. as they never found out about me having sex, i suppose my parents assumed their methods worked. however, last year, my sister (who is much braver than i was) came home to my parents and said she had a boyfriend. they got extremely angry, but knowing they couldn't really stop her seeing him without pulling her out of that school, accepted it somewhat.

my sister's boyfriend does not come from a religious background. i know his family well as i am friends with his older sister and they are very liberal.

my little sister and i share a room, and long story short, i found condoms in her pocket when i was tidying her clothes up. i asked her about it, and she told me they had been having sex for months with the condoms. i'm still pretty uneducated on sex due to my upbringing, but i have also been using condoms only for years so i - perhaps stupidly - assumed she would be fine and decided not to tell my parents. she is of age here and he is a nice boy, so i assumed it was fine.

this was a while ago, and i recently came home to a huge argument going on in my house. my parents had found out that my little sister is pregnant, and she has somehow been hiding it for all this time. my parents were going crazy at her, making her cry and simultaneously telling her she is stupid for getting pregnant but also that giving away the baby be wrong. my mother also claimed that an abortion would never be an option, to which my sister said she was too far along anyway. as far as i am aware, abortions are not permitted after the first trimester. at this point, my mother changed her mind and decided that my sister absolutely should have had an abortion. it was a huge mess in which i mainly stood aside. my mother eventually asked my opinion, and i replied:

""i think it's entirely your fault she is pregnant, you actively prevented her from knowing how to have safe sex and ultimately this child should be your responsibility, you have failed her and are abusing her for it.""

my whole family are now angry at me, and along with this i shared that i had sex at her age and the way they raised us made us deceitful. now everyone is angry at each other apart from me and my sister, and i can't help feeling like my input made it worse.",3

"i 32f just dropped out of my sisters30f wedding as her moh after a blowout fight because her fiance40m called me cheap. long story short they got engaged in march. he comes from a large traditional european household where money is a big thing for their wedding events. throughout all of there wedding things i've been there for my sister every step of the way, helping in any way i can. i've spent well over a grand just being present in her wedding party trying to keep up. both of them have good paying jobs and his family comes from a very well off household. i have one part time job and my parents aren't exactly considered ""well off.""

obviously my contributions are no where near what his family is used to but i thought giving what i could and putting in extra leg work would be enough maybe? 

anyways, for her shower i spent around 200$ and made her a 7ft x 6ft backdrop as a gift because it's something that she really wanted. it took over three months to make it by hand. the other girls in her wedding party are all from his side of the family and are what i could only describe as prissy rich girls. every time i try and make a suggestion that's cheaper for an event or something contributing to their wedding i get snubbed or ignored. no other bridesmaids have even lifted a finger to help my sister other than make bougie ass opinions on what she should do or be(which is not her). i've felt pretty left out in this whole process but didn't want to say anything because although i don't agree with how things are going, i want them to be happy because i love them. 

so today i went to my sister and her fiances house for coffee. and her fiance made a snarky comment about how i didn't give them an envelope of money at her shower. i said my gift was their backdrop and i thought that was okay. i reminded him that i'm only working about 20 hours a week right now and i can barely afford to pay my bills(i got laid off in january from my second job i had). he then preceded to say that his dad keeps a chart of how much everyone contributes to them and they had to lie otherwise he would of gotten pissed. i thought this was absolutely atrocious. i told him that weddings aren't about money. they are about love and family. and i've even known people that have gotten married and accepted zero gifts and just wanted to be surrounded by the people they cared about to celebrate their love. 

we went back and fourth for a few until i felt so overwhelmed i left and said i don't want to be a part of this anymore. i electronically transferred my sister money from my credit card and now i can't pay my gas bill and told her i don't want to talk anymore. maybe i overreacted but i was really upset. she's texted me a few times and says she doesn't want my money but i can't even right now. she said that their traditions aren't like ours and i said i'm not the one getting married so sorry for offending anyone's traditions so take what i gave you and count me out of anything else. 

i feel terrible. his family has completely taken over their entire wedding and has completely omitted our traditions as it is and now i'm expected to pay hundreds of dollars more than a thousand i've already spent for something i don't even want to be a part of anymore. i love my sister but she hasn't once stood up for me or our family(and our traditions) and i'm seeing her change right in front of me and it makes me so upset. 

i don't know what to do now or where to go from here. she's my only sister and i'm sure this will be her only wedding and i feel like i've just ruined everything. 

tl;dr i'm going broke being apart of my sisters wedding. her fiance called me cheap, we all got into it and i stormed out crying because i don't feel good enough. having regrets now. help.

***************************************

**edit:** for all that were asking, his family is serbian. and traditionally in his family they go to a lot of weddings and other events in their lifetime(seems like they have something going on almost every weekend for someone or something). his dad keeps a chart to keep track of how much money is given out so he can balance what they get in return. and **no**, i do not agree with this. 

**edit 2:** my sister showed up at my house last night and apologized. she returned the money i transferred her and spoke with her fiance. she said she wouldn't tolerate anything like this between our families. she let me know after speaking with her future husband that it's okay and will be okay if i can only give so much for the remaining duration of the wedding as she knows it's been a rough go for me this past year financially. she said he felt bad as we've all known each other for over 8 years and he wants to talk as he just reacted under the stress of his parents. i told her i needed some time away but i will still be her moh. she said she understood why i was so upset and she will do her best to stand up for our family in the future. she admitted to getting lost in everything going on and was only trying to keep everyone happy.

i was told for as long as i remember to never touch sienna's glasses. rightfully so since she is completely blind without them, and understandably my parents were protective over her. to this day i've never broken this rule because i thought it would be a step too far. 

however, when she didn't give my phone back and was saying all that stuff to aidan i felt like crying, and i just grabbed her glasses and threw them to the other side of the room under a table. 

as soon as the glasses came off sienna started crying. she dropped the phone and was begging me to get her glasses. i was so angry with her that i took the phone and went to aidan's place. 

i got home earlier and my parents were home from work. mum was hugging sienna and soothing her and dad was furious. apparently sienna spent over an hour feeling around for her glasses, and mum had to find them for her. sienna was still sobbing when i got home, and if i went anywhere near her she'd step back. it's like she's scared of me. 

mum says that after what i did to ''our poor little girl'' i should stay somewhere else for a few nights, since sienna doesn't feel safe with me here. i packed some stuff and went to stay with aidan, which is where i'm typing this. 

i don't think i did anything wrong. she took my phone and tried it on with my boyfriend. i know i should've given the glasses back but it's not like i broke them or damaged them. 

did i go too far and how do i win my parents trust back? 

tldr:i stood up to my sister by taking her glasses, and now she doesn't feel safe with me and my parents have kicked me out because of it.",7

"for telling the people sitting next to me at a restaurant that not all asian people are chinese?. i'm currently sitting at a malaysian restaurant. a couple of older white people are sitting at the table right next to me. from what it sounds like, they are on a date and the guy chose the restaurant. he keeps going on and on about how great of a place it is and how you can tell the food is legit because 'of all the chinese people eating here'. the woman of the pair keeps saying how she doesn't know about chinese food because 'they eat weird things' then spent 5 min berating the waitress about how the menu is large but there are very few gluten free options. when the waitress walked away from taking their order the guy commented on how he loves chinese restaurants because the waitresses are all very nice and helpful. he then turned to me (i'm not asian) and tried to engage me in their convo asking me about one of the items i ordered. 

at this point i was annoyed and instead of explaining 'what type of chinese dish' i am eating, told him flatly that we aren't eating chinese food and that there are almost no chinese people sitting in this restaurant eating. actually most of the people
sitting here are indonesian/korean (they are  speaking indonesian and korean not chinese) and that almost all of the staff are malaysian.

"by giving my kids insane haircuts and forgetting about it. pics included.. today.

was winter picture day at my kids school. i. like an idiot. forgot.  my wife had a busy day on her end and i decided to get some chores done, to include cutting a couple heads of hair(https://imgur.com/a/pptmiws). despite the wife regularly getting *moderately* pissed about it, i always cut it in some odd manor, giving them a nick-name to accompany. i leave them that way for a few hours until the joke runs its course and then fix it later. easy-peasy right?

as you can imagine, night-shift-working dad falls asleep (after the wife gets home, thoroughly unimpressed) and stays comatose until its time to go into work. then in the morning, both are already in beanies due to the cold weather. so it's mostly their fault.

at any rate the school staff must have a fairly white-trash connotation of us, as i never got a wtf call or anything. i frantically fixed them and the wife has no idea i hadn't fixed it before picture day.

"if you believe in free college, free healthcare and guaranteed income you should have a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration.. i just don't understand it. you want to give people free healthcare, free food, free college and free guaranteed income and also let anyone who wants to, come here? you might as well just put piles of cash at the border. 

how do you expect a system like that to survive? social welfare programs only work when enough of the population pays into them. if you're offering all this ""free"" shit and allowing unskilled, uneducated people who don't speak the language to flood into the country it will implode.

you're telling the entire world that if you're pregnant and can give birth here we will give your child free food, free college, free healthcare and free income for life.  why would they not try to come here illegally? i don't blame them, as future father with a baby due in september i would try and come here too. the fact is you can't take care of the entire world. just because you may want to doesn't mean you can. 

if you believe in any combination of free healthcare, free college and guaranteed income you should have a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration. stopping illegal immigration is the only way these policies would have a chance of being sustainable. 

as a real world example germany is currently paying immigrants to leave. they brought in over a million people in one year. they can't speak the language, can't work and have no where to live. they're draining the social systems in germany. so much so that it's cheaper for germany to pay them to leave. germany is offering to pay one year of their rent if they get the fuck out.

"don't be afraid of the word ""bond."" it's just a loan, backwards.. i've noticed that a lot of people hear the word ""bond"" and recoil. but a bond is just a loan, backwards.

when a bank issues you a loan, you borrow money from them. later, if everything goes well, you pay them back. also, you have to pay them some interest - because it was nice of them to let you borrow their money, and they weren't sure you would pay it back.

when a bank issues a ""bond,"" you pay them money to buy it. and then later, you can cash it in for more money.

conceptually, the bank is just borrowing money from you. they take money from you, and then later, they give you the money back, plus some more money.

the word ""bond"" literally is just a loan, where you are the lender, and they are the borrower.

here's some reading from /u/jooseman to get us started:

> the symbol π was not known to have been introduced to represent the number until 1706, when welsh mathematician william jones (a man who was also close friends with sir isaac newton and sir edmund halley) used it in his work *synopsis palmariorum matheseos* (or a *new introduction to the mathematics*.) there are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. the favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient greek word for periphery (the circumference).

> before this time the symbol π has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in geometry, where william oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). in ancient greece it represented the number 80.

> the story of its introduction does not end there though. it did not start to see widespread usage until leonhard euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other european mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work *mechanica* and finally it was his use of it in the widely read *introductio* in 1748 that really helped it spread.

"there was a man in bulgaria who drove a train for a living.... there was a man in bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

he loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

he made it out, but a single person died. 

well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

after eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

the switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

the man was perfectly fine.

well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

and somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

and once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""you know what? no,"" said the executioner. ""i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

the executioner was speechless.

the man looked at the executioner and said ""oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor.""",0

"i (33m) overheard my girlfriend (28f) making fun of me pretty brutally to her best friend (27m). when i say brutally... i mean brutally.. i originally posted this elsewhere, but it was deleted for whatever reason. i'm reposting so that i can link to it when i post the update. if that makes sense.

my girlfriend, ""jenna"", and i have been together for 2 years, a little over.

i'm a veterinarian and we met at my office. she had just moved to the city and brought her dog in for an ear infection. we started talking and what should have been a 15 minute appointment turned into an hour long talking session.

i've never been so smitten with a woman before. before jenna, i lived the bachelor lifestyle. i was beginning to think i'd just stay single forever, even though that lifestyle of nothing but casual flings was growing really old and empty.

jenna is a charismatic woman with a lot of friends. her best friend is a guy, ""dylan"", she knew in her old town. i trust jenna but i'd be boldfaced lying if i said that her relationship with him doesn't bother me at all. i don't get angry with her or fight about it, she's reassured me that they've been friends their whole lives and have never had any sexual relationship.

i'm secure and i'm not insane, so i accept that they are friends and have tried to buddy up with him as well. he has visited the city 3 times. he's a cool guy, however, he does not seem to like me much. jenna says he's just protective. it comes off a whole lot more like jealousy than protectiveness, in my opinion.

jenna just finished up grad school this spring but she's had a really tough time finding a job. we have lived together for a year and i've been understanding that she can't help pay rent, etc. right now. i'm very financially secure so it isn't an issue, however, i am careful to not become a reason for her to not get a job and have her own financial independence. i just think it's important for everyone to have this sort of independence. so, without being pushy, i've let her know that she does need to start paying half of the expenses once she secures a job.

anyway, she texted me at work on monday to tell me she got a job. it's a job she really, really wanted and had to go through some pretty grueling interviews to get. i was so happy and proud of her that i decided to leave the rest of the day at the office up to my staff and took off early without telling jenna.

i bought her favorite booze, grabbed a bunch of chinese take out (her favorite), and bought her flowers.

i had bought her a nice necklace that she'd seen at a store a couple of weeks ago. nothing super extravagant, but it has a shark on it and that woman is just obsessed with anything to do with sharks. i'd hidden it in the basement and figured i'd give it to her soon, totally surprise her with t once she'd forgotten about even seeing it in the store. i got home and came in the side entrance to the basement so i could grab the necklace and then surprise her.

when i came up the basement steps and opened the door, i could hear her talking on the phone. normally i wouldn't stop and listen but i heard her laughing uncontrollably, like belly-laughing. it was pretty cute so i figured i'd wait for her to get off the phone before i surprised her.

she was talking to dylan. nothing new there, they talk at least once a week.

then i heard what they were laughing about.

it took me a few dull minutes to realize that she was laughing about our sex life. she said something about how ""no, he can't even compare to (ex bf). ex bf had at least 3 inches on him."" ""i feel bad every time i eat a baby carrot around him because it must be traumatic to see me chomping down on something the same size as him."" ""it would almost be cute if it didn't suck so much. his body is amazing as long as he keeps his boxers on."" lots of laughter.

so look, i don't really give a crap what people on reddit think about the, erm... size of my member... but, i do think it's important to say that what she was making fun of wasn't even true. which in my opinion, makes it even more hurtful. i mean, i don't know about the ex bf, maybe he was a horse, but i'm very.... average. just good old fashioned average. not going to upsell myself here. it's nothing to write home about. but it's also not laughable. i've never felt self conscious, it is what it is.

to hear her ripping me apart to this guy that she knows i have some concern about was just beyond hurtful. hurtful doesn't cover it.

she also made fun of me for being ""gorgeous but not super smart"".

um... i'm actually highly educated. this isn't even remotely a concern of mine, i know i'm smart. gorgeous and super smart with an average sized penis, thanks very much.

i left after that. did i throw the flowers out of my car window? yes. did i cry in a parking lot? yes.

i think she may have heard the basement door close, maybe she even saw my car driving away, because she started texting me pretty quickly after i left. asking when i was coming home.

that was monday and i haven't brought it up. i don't know how. i think i'm still processing everything. it's horribly embarrassing and hurtful. but... damn i love this girl. not saying i'm going to forgive her necessarily, i just want to stress how hard this whole thing is for me.

i know i need to bring it up to her. but how? any suggestions on how to start this conversation with her? i'm extremely hurt and i don't know if i can forgive her for this

tl;dr: my girlfriend made fun of me with her male friend. about our sex life/my penis. pretty hurtful stuff. i feel like a puppy that just got kicked in the face. joking aside, i'm devastated. i was planning to propose in the next few months. now i don't see how i can even forgive her and stay with her. advice?

edit wow, hey thanks everyone! i just wanted to add that i definitely will be breaking up with jenna. i grabbed a beer with three of my friends tonight and told them. their sentiments matched the majority of yours: dump her and do it quick. i called my mom and told her about it (yes, i told her everything, embarrassing as it was; we are pretty close and i wanted to tell her the whole story) and i've never heard her so angry about anything. she knew i'd bought a ring for jenna. i will post an update after i do it (probably tomorrow), though it may take me a couple of days to post about it. i'm going to be pretty wrecked emotionally. thanks again for all the comments/messages of support and encouragement, i really didn't expect everyone to be rooting for me like this!

recently, i started dating r. we fell head over heals with each other but she was pissed when she found out i had kids. i explained the situation to her, and she cut a bit of slack after that. however, she still complains whenever i have to put my kids needs in front to her wants.
this evening, i was helping e with her summer reading assignment at the kitchen table, and r wanted to watch this movie with me, and i told her to wait a few. that is when she screamed, ""we can never have a real relationship because of your damm kids needing shit all of the time!"" 
the thing is, we do have a relationship like anyone else does. sure, i have to put my kids first every now and then, but i think that is how any relationship with kids would work, and ours is no exception.
tonight, as i said good night to the kids, e asked me why i would date r if she hated her and her sisters. my heart crushed into a billion pieces at that moment. 
this isn't the first time something such as that occurred. the twins had forgotten to put their orange peels in the trash and r screamed at me for being too permissive apparently. i heard k run off into a corner, silently crying to herself, ""my daddy is good, why is she r yelling at him??"" 
i am considering leaving r for the sake of how she treats my kids, and have asked her how she would feel if an adult treated her kids the way she does. the thing is, she has her own depression and anger issues and her family barely speaks to her anymore due to her behavior towards family members, similar to how she treats my kids.
i am at a crossroad right now. r is asleep on the couch after finishing the movie, and i am currently in the bedroom writing this with tears in my eyes. my kids have been through so much in their young lives so far, and it kills me that they know how r feels about them. i know what the long term affects can be. however, r has told me quality time with me is her only source of happiness at this point.

the other night, my boyfriend and i had our usual movie night and he begged me to watch a clockwork orange, his favorite film, with him. i'd always heard of it, it's an incredibly popular film, but never knew the plot or anything really. 

i of course agreed. but quickly i realized that this was not my type of film at all. i'm a multiple sexual assault survivor and am incredibly triggered and uncomfortable during scenes of sa and violence. 

when i voiced this, asking him if maybe we could watch something else, he got irritated with me and told me i just ""had to finish it to really understand."" 

again, i asked him to please turn it off. he did, very angrily, and then critizied me for not taking an interest in the things he likes. i found this to be incredibly unfair, as i have always gotten involved and excited about the things in his life. he continued to insult my intelligence and lack of understanding of the ""art of the film"" and i just left it at that.

he knows about my past traumas and has always been very sensitive and understanding about everything. i've never seen him like this and over a movie, no less.

instead of making me feel special, it all just makes me feel sad. i've never been with someone who hates whole groups of people like that, besides very obvious and logical ones like white supremacists and rapists. it bothers me. i'd be the last person to try to defend the entire male gender - i'm not interested in taking sides in any kind of gender war. it's just the negativity and the bashing and the insults that are starting to get to me. maybe it's illogical and weird in this day and age to be a straight man who feels a little hurt when their partner jokes that straight men are a blight upon society, but if that's the case, then i guess i'm just illogical.

"for not caring about my ex's family tragedy?. i dated my ex for 3 years and ended up finding out she was cheating for about half of that time. i broke up with her about 4 months ago and she moved out of my house. i ended up hearing from friends that she was painting me as the bad guy who drove her into the beds of all those guys she cheated with. no one believed her and she ended up isolating herself from the friend group because people really didn't like the way she handled things as far as cheating and with the break up.

her parents recently were killed in a bad car accident. it's a shame, they were very good people. i enjoyed the time i spent around them and they treated me well. they died about 5 days ago. 

my friends have been telling me over the past few days that she was asking about me and saying she wishes she could be with me and talk to me about the loss and apologize. 

i don't buy the bullshit. this isn't about her being sincerely remorseful about anything. this is her wanting to manipulate me into emotionally supporting her through this. her parents dying sucks and i'm sure that's awful to deal with, but it is firmly her problem, not mine. 

i told my friends this and they said they'd soften it but make sure she knows i'm not the one she should be calling or coming to.

she came over to my house early this morning a mess and crying and apologizing and begging at my doorstep. i thought about what i'd say but everything was going to be needlessly cruel so i just shut the door and she screamed so loud and for so long my neighbors called the police.

i didn't get in trouble or anything but it was embarrassing and i had to deal with explaining things to them(it sure was fun explaining the context of her saying her parents were dead and crying on my doorstep). 

my standing on this is pretty much that it sucks for her and more for her parents. but this isn't my job anymore—to deal with supporting her through anything.",3
"remorse i told my wife i wanted to have sex with her mom.. remorse 

first off it wasn't out of nowhere, i don't even plan on it and it's just a fantasy. so my wife and i are both 34, her mom is only 56 and we've been married for 10 years. her mom is smoking imo, i think it's just cause her and my wife look so much alike. they both have nice dark eyebrows dark hair brown hair, not the biggest breasts but nice asses. 

we were lying post sex yesterday, and she asked me some of my biggest fantasies. i told her a threesum, she laughed and reminded me that will probably never happen. then she asked me who i would want to join, and i didn't want to tell her but i just was straight up. i told that her mom would probably be my first choice. 

her response : yeah very funny asshole, now who? i told her i was serious, that i always found her mom very attractive. i reminded my wife that i think she's the most beautiful woman in the world (i do) and that her mom is the closest looking resemblance to her. it kinda sounded romantic in my head, but i knew i fucked up. 

it happened last night and she's been passive agressive, making snide remarks. asking me if she would wear her hair a certain way cause her mom wears it like that, or if she should do her makeup like this etc. she's pissed, i do feel bad but i was honest and don't take back my words.",11

"by trying to stand with no legs. this happened about a week ago. 

so some context to this. i was born with no legs. i have never had them they didn't even develop past like 2 inches of a femur but you cant really tell. 

i came home from fishing with my in-laws and was dead tired. i went from door to shower to bed and had no intentions of waking up before 10 hours. my wife woke me up so that way i could eat dinner. so i get up and am totally groggy and not really capable of thinking right.

my wheelchair is right there next to the bed so i scooted to the edge and sat there for a moment. for whatever reason i thought it would be a good idea to try and stand... it was not until it was to late did i realize what i had done but it all became slow motion... the fall... and seeing the floor get ever close. now i have a very good tolerance to pain. while staying active i have broken bones and cut myself up on rocks and such but nothing was able to prepare me for this... i landed flat on my balls...

i tried to scream but no sound could be heard however i am sure our neighbors dogs were losing their shit. i vomited and tried to move but couldnt even breath. my wife is having a hard time trying to show concern and hide her laugh at the same time. 

she has heard stories about how i have hurt myself in similar ways (waking up late for work with morning wood and nearly breaking my dick on a stair) but she never witnessed one.

the doctor was stumped on how to react outside of ""heres some pain killers dont move for a while"" 

also  i swear time become relative cause i am almost positive i watched 2 alaskan sunsets but it was only for about a hour i was on the floor in a puddle of puke. 

tldr: have no legs, tried to stand up off the edge of my bed and smashed my balls. 

edit: oh wow lol. i am happy alot of people have enjoyed this post. to clear a few things up yes my wife did try and help me up but i told her to leave me because i was in to much pain to sit up. she did clean up a good deal of the vomit but much of it was under me and i was not moving lol. she sat next to me the whole time. 

edit2: some people have asked why i tried to stand up. i think alot of it might be that everyone i have seen get out of a bed has done the same motions i attempted, so in my tired state for whatever reason my brain(that prick) decided this was the motion to use.

also people are saying they want to say a joke but dont know if they should.. do it! while some people may see it as a sad thing that i have no legs they should not. it hasnt stopped me from doing fun things in life even mono skiing and going on mountain trails. if i couldnt see the humor in my own disability(and there is plenty) life would be very hard.

"freezing your credit files at the 3 credit bureaus would not have saved you from the wells fargo scam.. i never banked with wells fargo. also, access to my credit files are frozen. this means nobody can check my credit history without my permission. in other words, no bank will issue a new credit card or open a new account ... since they would first want to verify my credit worthiness.  
now here is the outrageous loophole in the system - if you temporarily unfreeze your credit files so you can legitimately open a bank / credit account ... the current system allows that specific institution to have permanent access to your credit file even after you re-freeze it.  
so, in wells fargo's case they would have been able to access credit files regardless of whether they were frozen or not. moreover, i believe in this particular fraud, wells fargo employees opened accounts without going through the normal due diligence process.",10

"by telling my son the purpose of testicles. my son jack is 5 and i've always answered his questions honestly and as age appropriate as possible and also call all body parts by their anatomical names. this morning while in the bath jack is cleaning his penis and asks me what the thing is behind his penis (i'm hoping this isn't the first time he's noticed them). i tell him those are his testicles. he asks me what they do. i respond they make something that makes him grow into a man and also make something that will help him make a baby when he's grown up. he looks at me like i'm crazy 

him: ""mom, daddies don't make babies"" 
me: ""they help make babies""
him: a daddy didn't help you make me (he was conceived artificially with donor sperm and has no dad)
me (getting stuck): well no...not a daddy but i had to umm...
he interrupts me: seahorse daddies make babies. 

i'm relieved and thankful for octonauts and ask him to tell me more about seahorse babies and he describes the mating dance and ow the daddy seahorse carries the baby in a pouch. conversation over and i send him to brunch with my parents. 

he was dropped off about 30 minutes ago by my mother who informed me that he asked her if she had testicles, told her that he had them, told her he thought i had them as i made a baby without a daddy, then asked her when he'd grow a pouch for his babies for when he got older. thoroughly confused, she asked him what he was talking about. apparently he believes that having testicles means you make the baby and  whoever has testicles also carries the baby. this group consists of all male seahorses and some male humans and some female humans. 
i'm just going to allow this theory for awhile because i don't feel like explaining ovaries and eggs. 

tl;dr: told my son testicles help make babies, he now thinks he can grow a pouch and make babies like a seahorse.",4
"by not knowing what a queef was. like all other posts on this sub, this did not happen yesterday, but about 10 years ago when i was in my sexual prime. now before i begin, it should be noted i'm an only child. therefore i had no sibling to teach me about the birds and the bees, and my parents worked all the time. they both worked c-level jobs at big companies so i hardly ever saw them. everything i know about sex today is through experience and the wonderful world of the internet.

so at this time in my life, i had already had sex with a small handful of girls. being only 18, i thought i was hot shit. my life consisted of throwing parties at my parents vacant mansion and sex. every 18 year olds' dream right? well at one of my parties a group of college girls showed up (i was still a senior in high school) and the hottest girl of the college group was giving me vibes that she wanted to get it on. one thing let to another and we head up stairs..

everything started off normal, foreplay and what not, when i finally got her naked i spread her legs so i could go down on her (i like to be a gentlemen and please the girl first). as soon i get down to that region she lets out the smallest ""toot"". confused, i looked back up at her and she is still in a moaning bliss waiting for me to start as nothing happened. ""did she just fart on me?"" i thought to myself. she was still begging for it so i shrugged my shoulders and we got it on.

fast forward a week and we're now kind of ""dating,"" still having sex at least twice a day like new couples do. and each time she would let out a small ""toot."" i liked her a lot and didn't want to freak her out by asking her about it, so i decided to go to my friends (bad idea). they proceed to tell me that she's known as being a ""freak"" in bed and i just need to along with it. 

ok here's when the actual fuck up happens... so that night we start fooling around and this time she wants to go down on me first. she's giving me the typical bj when she goes down a little further for a little ball play... that's when i cock my legs up and release the biggest fart i could muster. i swear her hair flew back as if she had her face in front of a fan. she immediately stops what she's doing and looks back at me in disgust. i smiled with pride and said ""that's all for you babe."" 

she locked herself in my bathroom and cried until she let me call one of her friends to come pick her up. 

tl;dr: didn't know what a queef was and thought my girlfriend was farting during sex as a fetish. i returned the ""favor"" by farting in her face when she was going down on me.

"i abandoned my family to take my own life. i was born into a family of religous extremists, throughout my childhood i witnessed and was subject to all kinds of child abuse. one of my earliest memories is being pinned down by two of my older brothers and molested by my sister.

my parents brought me up believing that a gay man is not a man at all, and i believed it, they got me to reject my own sexuality and hate myself for something beyond my control.

for more than two decades i was maliciously bullied by my family. my parents tried and succeeded to stifle my emotional, mental and sexual development. what was important to them was my fathers career as a clergyman. anything that did not fit his narrow world view warranted a violent outburst. 

my family crippled my ability to engage or even feel safe around people. for many years i couldn't even speak to a person unless they spoke to me first. i am an extrovert but i isolated myself as best i could to try and feel safe.

i was extremely depressed, suicidal, miserable and hopeless. i don't know whether no one noticed or no one cared. at 12 years old i decided i would distance myself and then end my life.

i was and am still afraid of my family, they put me through hell. they were violent and morally corrupt to the core. even today i am terrified of facing them. 

 after i had graduated high school i new it was almost time. i found myself a job i could sustain myself on, and once i'd moved into my new home i cut them off completely.

they attempted to make contact with me through various methods but i refused to allow it.

i'm a 21 year old trying to get a career in banking. an opportunity came up for an unpaid internship in singapore. i thought, who wouldn't want to spend a few months in singapore? new alcohols, criminally cheap massages and asian food.

the fuckup started when the time came to speak to someone. leaving the airport i flagged a cab and spent about 5 minutes trying to communicate where my apartment was. it turns out singaporeans speak 'english'. they know english but they speak it with such a heavy accent and so much slang its indecipherable to a piece of uncultured white trash like me. i've gotten really good at the smiling and nodding technique whenever someone questions me.

it turns out singapore is ranked the most expensive city to live in the world (via time magazine) and there are no cheap massages. i knew it was a major city but i figured there would be some places on the outskirts that were more affordable. i spent the first week eating nothing but mcdonalds (thank god the holy arches are all over in this damn world) until i found this little rice/noodle stand that will sell plates for a few bucks. the first day the old chinese lady who mans the stand thought she could scam the dumb american but after 5 minutes of animated bargaining i got the price down. way better than mcdongholes.

the company i'm interning with apparently ran out of space in their main office so they plopped my ass in a dinky little satellite office. the first week i did some work on a project for them that apparently they didn't like because i have not heard from them for two weeks. i sent a few emails and texts to my contacts (who are at the main office) who just said there is a lot going on for them atm.

to make matters worse i found a friend from america a few days into the trip and we had been having a good time trying local bars out and attempting to flirt with local girls in the evenings. well a few nights ago we had a bit much to drink and decided it would be a good idea to take a dip in the fountain outside our apartment. after a few minutes of fun, a patrol car flies up and a pair of officers jumps out yelling at us in what might have been english. i booked it without thinking, nothing but my sopping wet boxers. i tried calling my friend after the incident and legitimately have not heard from him for 3 days now.

so now i'm stuck on the other side of the fucking world, no idea what i'm doing here, no real job, the only source of sustenance is a chinese lady with a grudge and my only friend is presumably rotting in a singaporean dungeon.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - i took an internship in singapore, can't understand anyone, my company ghosted me, and my only friend was taken by the cops.

edit 1: yes everyone. i realize i'm an uncultured american swine. if there are any local girls willing to educate me, i'll be at the local mcdonalds.

"for banning everyone who critiques our parenting from meeting our son?. my wife has minor anxiety and ocd. she has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. none of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. it was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. she had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn't want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn't. i talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn't want to do it.

after the delivery, i was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. a lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. my wife said she wasn't going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. she said she just kept saying ""i don't want to,"" but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. i came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.

things got considerably better when we left the hospital. my wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. this was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.

the conflict comes in because i told my dad he couldn't be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. i've also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. a number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we're using and so on. i stopped sending photos, but my wife and i talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.

so i told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can't come meet the baby. they probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife's parents, her sister, and my mom.

a lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. my mom told me i should give them a chance, but i think the risk is too big. am i the asshole for banning them?",3

"flneighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent. ms paint diagram (since y'all seem to like those)(https://imgur.com/x7wgekj)

i inherited this house & surrounding property from my great grandparents when they passed away. this includes two rental properties, which my great-grandfather had been renting out for years to two families. relations between the three families had always been cordial, even when my great grandparents passed a few years ago and i became the new ""landlord"", though the ""dads"" of both families are only a little younger than my grandfather, and i get the impression from our interactions they chafe a little bit that their new landlord is a woman in her late 20s, but i figured everything is fine because i've never raised the rent beyond what my great-grandfather set it at, and i always have professionals over to deal with any issues on the homes within 24 hours of receiving a call from them.

about three years ago, a local kid was messing around in my magnolia trees, and broke his leg. my homeowner's insurance paid the settlement to the kid's family, but just to be on the safe side i had a surveyor come out and mark the property line for my ""lot"" (they also used the word ""plat"", but i'll be honest, this isn't my area of expertise) vs the lots of the two rental houses, and then had a contractor come out and put a white pvc fence at the property line, just to ward off a repeat incident.

like some kind of fairy-tale, the kids of the families that rent from me fell in love and have decided to get married. they wanted to have a ""block party"" and the bride's father asked if i'd be okay with them decorating on my property as well, since it's part of the block. i admit, i took ""decorating"" to mean things like hanging lights or other traditional wedding decorations, so i gave my consent.

this morning i woke up to the sound of chainsaws, and went outside to discover the parents of the bride & groom were cutting down my magnolia trees (each tree is about 80 years old - this house was purchased as a wedding present for my great grandmother, and they planted magnolias there when they got married. if my great grandmother had lived she'd be turning 100 next year) because they didn't match the bride's ""aesthetic vision"". 

i told them to stop immediately, i didn't give them permission for that, and i was going to call the police. they stopped, but when i went inside to grab my cell they started up again.

when i confronted them, i was basically told that since they're my tenants, i'd just be suing myself, so i could ""suck it up, buttercup"". i admit, i was more than a little intimidated by a group of men with chainsaws. i went back in my house while they continued cutting and called the police, who came out and told them to stop, and gave them tickets, but they started up again once the police were gone. i called the police again, and they haven't come back out yet. i've also already called an arborist friend of mine (i'm a florist), to come out and do an assessment immediately. i called my insurance company as well, and they're going to have someone call me back. but while i'm waiting, i thought i would ask here: can i sue them? or am i, as their landlord, liable for their actions against me? needless to say, no one is getting their lease renewed, even though they've lived here for decades.

"by befriending a lobster. so this isn't really today, but rather a summary of my last couple of lobster filled days and how i made a 150 mile journey to put a lobster in the sea.

so i'm a student and since coming to university i eat a lot of fish. like 5/6 times a week. the only way to afford this is to prepare my food from scratch - including preparing my own fish  (£15 salmon can feed a man for two weeks) so i'm not squeamish - it also means i have a healthy working relationship with my local fishmonger. every single trip, he will have some wild caught, exotic, fancy, or otherwise intriguing catch. there will be a little barter, i'll probably buy it.

**wednesday**

this day is no different, i walk in looking for some coley (great alternative to cod, please try it, sustainable), when the fishmonger is like ""ah my friend! only the best for you? i have the special stock out back"" 

of course i want the special stock.

so he goes out back, and brings back this little fella, beautifully blue, with just one antenna, he puts it on the table. it wiggles that little antenna at me... and in that moment, i decided that the lobster in front of me was special. i say that i'll decide if i want it tomorrow. 

i go home... distressed? i don't know why - but in those small moments i emotionally connected with a fucking lobster. i go on a panicked 2 hour frenzy (this is the middle of exam season, i should be revising) looking for tanks, looking up lobster information, trying to work out how i will hide a lobster in my room. eventually i realise that there is no way of keeping this lobster. i try to find friends and family with tanks that have no fish, or someone that want's a pet lobster - nothing. i decide to purchase it, and try to find it a home, and if not, quickly put it down with a knife (instead of boiling, which i am confident, having read the scientific literature, causes a lobster distress and pain).

**thursday**

*i feel at this point i should inform you that my confused girlfriend now knows i am getting a pet lobster*


now before i go to the fishmongers, i head to the supermarket. i need supplies to transport the lobster; and if i have to put it down, it will have a nice meal before it dies.
i purchase the following

1) sea salt

2) ice

3) salmon, cod, prawns, broccoli, carrots (stuff that the internet said lobsters like)

4) tea towels

5) apple juice (to help me with the emotional stress i'm currently in)

i go to pick it up, the fishmonger (ex-chef) asks if i want it boiled, i say no, and that i will cook it myself. he gives me seaweed to keep him comfy and hydrated in. i take it home. turns out the lobster is male. i name him qui-gon because there's always a bigger lobster. i take apart my plastic drawers, and pop him in one of them. along with the sea weed and food. i play some underwater sounds i downloaded on my phone. i take pictures and post pictures of him on pet sites on facebook looking for a home and/or a tank - my third plan, was now to house him at my parent's home. 

*at this point my family knows i own a pet lobster*

oh, i have a 24 hour bug and feel very very sick? fantastic.

wait? it's thursday - i'm meant to be making the two hour journey back home today - i have to be back to go to comic con on friday morning.

but this little guy needs a home. being in a tank isn't good. he needs the ocean.

anyways, me and qui-gon have a nice day. i work out a plan to get him to the sea. i'm too ill to make the 6 hour journey to skegness. however, i can make an hour and a half journey to my hometown, and my friend has offered to drive me the other hour and a half to southend the following evening.

i put him on the side, fill the box with ice, place the first teatowel over the ice, then put him back in the box with some food, then food and seaweed. finally i put the second teatowel over the box to protect him from the sun. i've made up artificial saltwater to the correct concentrations to splash him with (not great, but should keep him hydrated).

lots of train delays, tram delays, bus delays. should be home at 8, i get back at 10.30. me and qui-gon made a lot of friends - apparently you get attention when carrying a lobster on a 110 mile train journey. he's eaten some fish, seems happy. no signs of stress such as tail thrashing. 

i get him home and put the box back in the fridge. he seems a happy lobster. i check on him before bed. happy lobster.

i wake up at like 7. i check on qui-gon. he is responsive and seems okay, i splash him a little more. i head to london

i get back, my friend informs me that there is a fish center that can take him, about 30 miles away - and keep him in suitable conditions. i agree on the condition that he will be released in cornwall (where he first came from).

sadly, when i got home, he was unresponsive - after trying to get him to do stuff, gently brushing his eyes, unclipping his claws, etc. it's clear he is dead. i'm legitimately upset. a fully grown, 6ft, bearded man, may have cried over a lobster.

however, he did eat the salmon and cod, and displayed no signs that he had thrashed or tried to escape, or was other wise stressed. it seems that he died whilst numbed from the cold of the fridge, hopefully asleep.

i wrapped him in the seaweed so it would be like home, and went to the nearest lake, and eased him into the water. he didn't last long enough to get him proper help.

i literally spent wednesday-saturday with my life revolving around looking up information, caring for, seeking help for, and transporting, a lobster. i do not like animals, i do not want pets.

qui-gon was a special fella.

tldr: avid meat/fish eater. emotionally bonded with a lobster in a fishmongers. went on 120 mile (193km) journey in an attempt to return him to the sea. he died, now i am sad. however he had a nice couple of days eating fish and making friends.

**sipc coverage:**

robinhood claims(https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001469903) that accounts will be covered by the sipc. however, this claim now appears to be dubious given comments by the director of the sipc, who, in an interview with bloomberg, said(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-14/sipc-says-it-has-serious-concerns-about-robinhood-s-new-product):

> ""i disagree with the statement that these funds are protected by sipc,"" stephen harbeck, president and chief executive officer of sipc, said in an interview friday. ""had robinhood called us, i would have told them what i just told you in that i have serious concerns about this. this has gigantic ramifications for the banking industry.""

current media coverage of this issue tends to support the idea that robinhood checking funds would not qualify for sipc coverage (here(https://www.axios.com/robinhoods-new-checking-account-b2b0df32-40c6-4bd1-b336-2408b27f16b0.html), here(https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/sipc-chief-raises-concerns-to-sec-about-robinhoods-free-checking-accounts.html), and here(https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-app-is-offering-a-3-interest-rate-to-take-on-the-banks-51544723146)).

"if i fired our sitter over religion?. background: my husband and i are both agnostic. our child is 2 years old. we've agreed to introduce to her the cultural and historical aspects of major religions when fit (e.g. when we walk past a mosque and she gets curious. not telling her anything complicated as of now because, you know, she's 2) and save the doctrines for when she's older. our babysitter, i'll call her ""emily"" here, has the patience of a saint, is very helpful and... religious. 

when emily mentioned her religion during our interview, i made it crystal clear that we will respect that, but i also expect her to respect our wishes regarding religions. i gave her some guidelines like no doctrine-embedded stories (e.g. we're all damned because our ancestors decided to eat an apple), no teaching of doctrines etc. emily understandingly obliged, or so we thought.

one day i came home early and caught her telling my child the story of creation of the world. i explained to emily in private that it contradicts what we've been telling her, you know, dinosaurs and such, and reminded her of our agreement. she apologized. i dropped it at that. yesterday i found out she's been reading to my child religious books for kids that basically tell their readers  to pray to and obey some deity. not cool. 

now i want to fire emily because of the religious teaching behind my back, but my husband disagrees. he thinks what's important here is that emily takes good care of our child, and considering that she spends at most 20 hours a week with her, it shouldn't be too hard for us to ""undo"" the religion part. i told him that a friend's child came home calling their parents sinners after two sunday school classes so 20 hours a week isn't as trivial as he thinks. he says i'm overreacting and would look really bad if i fire emily over this issue. plus, our child has bonded with her already, so replacing her would do our child a disservice. i want to respect my husband's opinions but i'm starting to resent emily. so reddit, would i be the asshole if i fire her?",3

"for finally snapping at my wife about my drinking?. throwaway account for obvious reasons as my wife uses reddit but not this sub.

i know how that title sounds but please bear with me for a minute.

my wife(32f) and i(33m) have been together for 10 years in october and married for 6 of those years. she comes from a... broken home to say the least. her mother was a drunken alcoholic and her dad was never there, she has one brother and he's a junkie as well. her life growing up was not easy and i will always respect her for rising above all of that and persevering through it all.

now onto my problem. my wife has an issue with *any* substance that can get you high or drunk and understandably so. she made this clear after about 2 years of us dating when she told me about her family. now this i have no issue with, i asked her if me having a few beers socially would be an issue and she said no.

cut to the last few years and her anger to booze has become *much* more apparent. she claims my drinking 2 beers after working a stressful day makes me an alcoholic. now if i was drinking every day she may have a point but i have maybe 3 beers a week at most and *maybe* once a month i may go to my buddy's place and play overwatch and have a few more. i don't get drunk by any stretch at my friend's place but just a good buzz and uber home. i have only ever been legitimately drunk 3 times in our relationship, none of which she was around for and only ever heard second hand. i like to think i'm respectful about it; i keep my beer in the minifridge in the basement, i don't drink in front of her and at her request i don't talk to her at all when i have those few beers on a friday.

i have in the past quit drinking because she asked me to. last time i quit for 2 years just because. quitting is never an issue for me but her badgering me and claiming i'm an alcoholic *all the time* finally caused me to snap at her and tell her that just because her mother was an alcoholic doesn't mean i am. i told her that her extreme hatred for it is causing more issues for me than anything else in my life at this moment. she will literally go from the most sweet person to a completely passive aggresive person in one second when she realizes i bought a 6 pack for the next 2 weeks. the obvious answer is to just quit which would be fine but sometimes i just like to unwind after work you know? i don't get trashed on a regular and i don't let alcohol get in the way of my life so i'm at a loss. if she said ""it's me or the booze"" then i would 100% pick her but my issue is that her problem with alcohol isn't rational and it's not *me* she has an issue with but instead her issues with her mother.

we go out enough and we both hang around with people who drink and she has no issue with them so here i am wondering if i'm an asshole. i feel after a few years of her yelling at me i was justified in getting a bit upset but her friends are calling me an asshole.",3
"my boyfriend has no boundries with exwife. first post on reddit ever, so please bear with me.  
i met my so 6 months ago on tinder. we hit it off fabulously.   spent tons of time together,  our children met, our families met,  declared we loved each other, had great respect for each other, and all in all, felt very safe and secure in the relationship.   until 2 days ago. 
he has an ex wife who he has admitted still wants him.  they had 3 children together and of course need to co parent these children.  one of their children plays for a competitive sports team, and that team were travelling for a championship game which my so needed/wanted to attend.  told me the original plan was he was travelling by himself with his kids and staying at a hotel.  which ive known about for a month.  no problem.   woke me up 1 hour before he was to take this trip and advised that there had been a change in plans and now he and ex wife were travelling together this long distance trip and they were staying all together in a hotel room because his ex wife had suggested it to him the day before and he felt it was a good idea.  then just asked me if i was uncomfortable with that and left to take his daughter to school.  upon his return,  his other children were there, so unwilling to discuss anything in front of them.  cue the ex wife into the house, waiting for him, and he turns to me and says with her right beside him- ""we good?"" .... suffice to say, we not good.  at all.  i sent him a text explaining how this made me feel (hurt, confused) and he said it was a shitty text and that i am attacking him and now he won't answer my calls or my texts.  
wtf did i do wrong? doesn't this seem like absolutely no boundries set with his ex wife? am i correct in wanting to just walk away? any advice would be appreciated.

"bad guys need to prevail more often in movies/shows.. i hate that in like 95% of movies, it's just the protagonist overcoming some seemingly impossible odds to defeat the antagonist. it's so predictable, overdone and mostly unrealistic. it takes away from the suspense because you know the good guy will prevail in the end.

one script that i really enjoyed was the hunger games series. spoiler warning just in case. now technically the good guys still won in this series, but it turned into quite a pyrrhic victory in the end as the protagonists had to sacrifice so much to win, that the worthiness of the cause was up for debate by the end. i fuck with that shit honestly.

another example would be game of thrones. spoiler warning again. the red wedding? loved that shit because it drew a new emotion that i hadn't experienced in film before. to have such major protagonists like that so suddenly ripped away was more compelling than if they had lived imo.

i don't know whether this opinion is unpopular or not but it seems to be with how often the protagonists prevail in film. i'd just like to see more variety in story lines, i feel like the hero overcoming insurmountable odds to enjoy a happy ending is just way too overplayed.

"my youngest brother and his girlfriend left their daughter with me a month ago and haven't been in contact since. to make a long story short my youngest brother and his girlfriend are completely unfit to be parents, they can't even take care of themselves. drug use combined with alcohol abuse and just their ages 19 and 20.

my parents had him later on in life, i'm 33 and my middle brother is 28 and he's 19. he pretty much has never cared about anyone except himself. then he met his current girlfriend and managed to knock her up between being passed out from alcohol or various drugs. we were all worried about him and the kid so we got together as a family and got him an apartment, a car etc.

well apparantly giving him all this newly discovered freedom of his first apartment and car made him do the opposite, he didn't grow up and apparently doesn't want to take care of his own daughter. a month ago he dropped her off while he was drunk, i hit him for driving drunk with my niece and told him if he ever does it again i won't stop. 

well now it's a month later and he hasn't come back, hasn't called, hasn't done anything. i'm not complaining about having to watch my niece, i love her. i don't want her to go back to my brother, he's not in a place to take care of her or even himself.

how can i begin to move towards becoming her guardian without a whole lot of money and is there anyway to do it somewhat quietly? the family would flip out, everyone looks at him as a baby still but he's not. he's 19 and being stupid. i don't have a lot of spare money and having to buy all the stuff related to her has been and is expensive.

"by having diarrhea for my entire adult life. this is a lifetime in the making, but i realized the depth of my stupidity today. 

when i was a young kid (under 10) i watched some sort of health program where other kids were explaining how different body systems worked, what you could do to be healthy, how bad injuries heal, etc. during this program, there was one kid talking about your digestive tract. he had a clear tube a couple inches in diameter full of food stuff. he explained that when you ate food with fiber, it helped move your food through your system, demonstrated by pushing a pipe cleaner through the tube and the food flying out. i thought, oh cool fiber pushed food through your system. 

fast-forward to adulthood. i develop a myriad of gastrointestinal issues, eventually diagnosed as ibs. i get wicked poops. like, pure liquid running out of my butt. picture lava flowing down a volcano. it's gross. 

i start to see doctors. lots of doctors. before the ibs diagnosis, all of the life threatening things are ruled out with lots of very invasive procedures (hello colonoscopy before 21!). the first doctor tells me to eat fiber to help with the diarrhea, i nod politely and ignore him. so does the second, third, fourth...all of them. these quacks want me to introduce a pipe cleaner to this situation?! i have no problems getting food out! why in the world would i do that?

i proceed to suffer through over a decade of ibs, alternating between medicine to stop it and medicine to make me shit. 

today, after a stint that cost me yet another pair of underpants, it occurs to me that fiber isn't a pipe cleaner. 

fiber is what bulks up your poops so you can have normal poop. fiber is what i need. 

i've paid for thousands of dollars of doctors and ignored their advice based solely on a fucking tube and a pipe cleaner. 

i've sharted countless times and ruined so many underwear. i've spent fifteen years in misery because of something i learned at 9. 

because i am an idiot who doesn't listen to doctors. 

i fucked up. 

i will be buying fiber supplements in the morning. 

tl:dr: fiber bulks your poops up, doesn't push them out like a pipe cleaner. take your fiber, kids. ",4
"girlfriend's parents say i embarrassed them by teaching their daughter. time to go ?. long story short, my girlfriend has already been heavily spoiled by her parents and the tonnes of pathetic chasers that are willing to do anything for her like a queen, before we were together. i just didn't realise it would be this bad.

so to sum up, recently it was her birthday, and she literally nagged and nitpicked everything, from the restaurant (tables without table cloth, curtains not good, waiters not smart enough, food not good, plates not pretty, air conditioner too cold, too many people, too noisy, there's mosquitoes which will bite her), to the cake, to the gift, to the location of the restaurant (the fact that we have to walk a while to get up here, like literally 10 mins, but she's wearing high heels so i can relate).

since we were eating with her parents, she has been throwing these moods at me all the way when we were walking from the station, all the way even when we sat down, and she continued to sulk and threw tantrums about all the things mentioned above, in front of her parents.

she even began saying shit like; next time, i'll arrange the birthday celebration myself. can't really trust you. right, next year you probably ain't here too, no worries. 

that moment i kept controlling myself to talk back and kept saying: it's okay. i'll do better...etc, but i could no longer take this crap anymore (she's been acting like this back then, not just on the birthday, but today i've opened my eyes wide). i spoke up to her and reasoned with her. i said: i planned everything for you since i love you, and the least thing you could do is appreciate ? how do you think it makes me feel if you keep saying those things ? i have emotions too. 

and then she started crying and said i'm abusing her and embarrassing her in front of her parents. her parents seemed cool and they should know their daughter well, so they just defused the situation.

now day's over. once they're back home, they love to have these family discussions. my girlfriend called me that night and said: i'm very disappointed. you embarrassed me and thrashed my party. now i'll forever remember this 2xth birthday every year. and my parents said you embarrassed them too because it feels like you're helping them to teach their daughter, implying they don't know how to teach her.

man....am i just new to this world? what's up with these ?

oh and an update: she thinks i have bipolar syndrome since i normally wouldn't talk back and suddenly does. also, she thinks i'm evil and has been plotting this for a long time to destroy her birthday....she said no one has ever talked to her like this before and i have a lot of guts.",7

"fined $13,066 from the tsa for grabbing my insulin pump. <edited to add location - incident happened in austin, tx, i live in fl>

i travel a lot for work, and am a type 1 diabetic who uses an insulin pump.  the pump manufacturer told me when i received my new pump that it cannot go through any x-ray machine, full body scanner, etc.  when i go through the tsa line, i hold my pump out and tell them it cannot go through.  


every time before this particular incident, they understood the protocol when i give my spiel, take the pump, let me pass through the full body scanner, have my carry-on x-rayed, then as soon as i step through the full body scanner, they swab my pump, hand it back to be, and i go on my way.


this time it was different.  i did my usual spiel, held my pump out, and the tsa agent seemed flabbergasted.  she grabbed a plastic bowl, put my pump in it, and set it aside.  told me to walk through the scanner, which i did (with no problem).  she told me to wait for another tsa agent to come and swab the pump.  no problem here.  unusual from what i was used to, but i'm okay with it.


just some context, my blood sugar was high and i need that pump attached to me to take extra insulin to bring my blood sugar down.  i didn't take any extra before going through the line, as i thought i'd get it right back, as i always do (after they swab it of course).


a couple minutes go buy, and this tsa agent keeps going about her business waving people through the line, with me still standing there, and her not acknowledging me.  i walk over, tap her on the shoulder, and say ""hey can you please address my pump as i need it back.""  she says yes but i will need to call another agent over to swab it, and radio's for another tsa agent to come over to address.  i wait another couple minutes (felt like an eternity, and i am starting to feel like shit from the high blood sugar, coupled with the anxiety from being ignored).


i tap on her should again, express the urgency, and again she says sure and radio's another tsa agent over to swab the pump.  another couple minutes go by, and no other tsa agent is responding, and she is going on her merry way scanning other people through the machine.


here's where is fucked up.  i was so paranoid and out of it from my high blood sugar and lack of insulin, that i grabbed the pump out of the bowl, attached it to my body, and went to my gate.  


about 45 minutes later, 3 tsa agents came to my gate, took me back to the scanning area, and interrogated me.  i was fully cooperative, apologetic, explained the medical condition, etc.  after i explained everything, they were very nice and apologetic to me too.  but they said they had to fill out an incident report.  photographed my drivers license, the pump, me, etc.  said i would be getting a letter in the mail, probably a warning, and not to stress about it.


fast forward a week later and i get an official letter from the tsa in the mail saying i need to provide my side of the story, stating that i was in violation of title 49 code of federal regulations (c.f.r) 1540.105(a)(1), which is subject to a fine of up to $13,066 per violation.


the letter does not provide the actual language of the above regulation, nor an assertion of how i violated the regulation.  they stated i have 20 days to provide my defense, in writing, with any information that i wish to be considered in their investigation.


a few questions:


1.  should i consult an attorney and have them help me draft my response?

2.  if not, how should i word my response?  i can't refute leaving the tsa area with my pump (which i admit, was stupid, it was caught on camera).  


3.  will my medical issues provide them with enough mitigating circumstances to drop the case against me?   i am thinking right now about explaining why i acted the way i did, and ignoring the fact that i walked away like an idiot.


thanks in advance for any help.  $13k is a shitload of money.  will i face jail time if i cannot pay?  i was an idiot, but felt under duress due to my medical condition and the tsa negligently withholding my medication. ",2

"my 5 year old son got punched in the face on the school bus. i never thought i would have to worry about my son being hurt at school. and not even a month into kindergarten. what happened was that my son gave his friend a picture he drew and the kid next to him took it from him and tore it up. so he told him that he was going to to tell the bus driver and the kid punched him in the face. all the kids got off the bus except my son. the bus driver told me that there was an incident involving my son and another kid. i get on the bus and my son has a bloody nose, blood splatter on his arms, his shirt and pants. his dad had to fill out a report about what happened. my son was spitting up blood for over an hour. me and his dad took our son to school the next morning and tried to have a meeting with the principal and said that she wasn't in at the moment. and that they would contact me before the end of the school day. and they didn't. that was my fault, i should have called regardless. i asked them if there would be any disciplinary action towards the other kid and they didn't really give me a response. he even took the bus home from school that day! he wasn't suspended from school or from the bus. it's almost like he just got talked to and nothing happened. what should the school be doing? we live in california.i want to know what i actions i can take to make sure that this kid won't ever bother my son again.

"for wearing a white dress to a wedding?. i know you're technically not supposed to do that but the bride of this one wanted a different type of wedding. she wore a black dress to the wedding and i knew beforehand she'd do this. i literally wore a cheap, white summer dress and all the girls were making petty comments about me throughout the night. 

one of the bridesmaids walked up to me, a disgusted look on her face and says ""dont you know you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding?""

i responded with, ""for fucks sakes thats only so you dont upstage the bride! shes wearing black!"" to be fair, i shouldn't have been so mean about it but for hours these girls had been staring at me, giving me nasty eyes and making comments about me. i dont even think the bride cared, she seemed to enamored by her husband to be aware of anything else

"by misunderstang a miserable girls simple request.. tl;dr i didn't under stand what a girl was asking me so i ended up telling her most intimate secrets to a room full of guys  


ok so this was actually some time ago back in 2005 but i figured it belongs here.  


i was in highscool and devil may cry 3 had just come out. i didnt have a console to play on but was an avid fan of the series so i asked my very popluar friend fidde if i could come hang out in his student pad and play it on his ps2 to wich he agreed. awesome! so we get there, i'm happily mashing buttons when some of his also very popular friends show up and they decide to head to the supermarket for some snacks and drinks. so i am left all alone in the small apartment, happily playing videogames when suddenly the doorbell rings.  


""thats odd"" i thought to myself. they have the key. maybe they're carrying stuff? the bell rings again so i go over to the dor and open it up and find a girl standing there with her eyes all red and bawled out, the faint smell of beer on her breath.  


""is fidde in?"" she asked timidly.  
""uh no sorry, but he'll be right back, he's at the store"" i told her  
""uhm ok"" she paused then asked if it would be ok for her to come inside and wait. i didn't see a problem with that so i let her in and went back to the game.

only a minute or so passed before she tried talking to me. she sheepishly explained that she was unhappy about some stuff and that she'd really like if she had someone to talk to. i wanted to be a gentleman but i also wanted to play the game so i end up lending her an ear going ""mhm"", and ""ah , yeah"" every now and then but lord have mercy on me because she decided to not only tell her lifes story but also reveal som rather private and embarrasing things she'd done.

turns out she was having relationship problems, she was in love with a guy that her friend then started dating so to get back at her in some way she started going out with her friends ex but since she was unhappy about it she had sought comfort from her old friendzoned guyfriend who she ended up hooking up with but he then confessed that the ex that she was currently dating was still in love with her friend and a friend of her crush had told him that her crush was actually into her and not her friend who he was currently dating. and then she told me that she had been unhappy because of that and been drinking alot and ended up hooking up with some more guys that she regretted now. there were probably more details but that was the gist of it.

now i have this ability to retain short term information well if i am playing a mindless game while listening so while she was talking everything she said was imprinted in my memory to the very last detail and halfway in i realised the every single one of those guys that she mentioned were at the store with fidde. 

she went to the fridge and brought out a beer bottle and asked me if i thought fidde would be okay with her having it. confident that he wouldnt mind i said ""sure, why not""

halfway into her bottle the party came back all suprised to see this girl with me. there was a certain akwardness in the room and i understood why but i didn't really care. chad and stacy problems weren't my problems.

after everybody said hi and settled down just haning out she leaned over to me from her chair and said ""uhm, could you tell'em please?""

i pause the game, confused, could she really mean what she was saying?  
""are you sure?"" i asked with a serious look on my face. surely all that stuff would just be way to embarassing for anyone to know, but then again she did tell me, maybe she just needed help coming clean? yeah that made sense.

""ok then"" i said and cleard my throat and turned to the room.

""uh yeah excuse me everyone, louise here asked me to tell you all that...""

i proceeded to recite her story, being careful to include important details and give an as fair and informative version as possible of her ramblings.

a couple of sentences in, her face turned bright red and her head fell into her hands as she covered her face.

when i was done monolouging for 5 minutes straight there was an intensely akward silence as everybody stared in disbelief

""did i get everything?"" i asked her

""noo!"" she whined through her hands, ""about the beer i took from the fridge!""  


we all died that day, guts busted beyond repair from laughing so hard. one kid fell to the floor and couldn't get up for an hour. on the bright side, having all that cleared up solved her problems so although embarrasing, it all worked out in the end.",4
"my gf (24f) and i (25m) have been together for 6 years, recently she suggested that we open up our relationship because she wants the excitement of guys flirting with her again.. when she initially brought the subject up two weeks ago i told her that i wasn't comfortable with the idea which she responded with ""i still love you and want to be with you but if you don't want this then we should break up."" 

we talked about it some more and when i asked her that if it was just going to be flirting or if she was planning on sleeping with anyone she said that if it happens it happens. after hours of trying to figure things out i reluctantly agreed because i didn't want to lose her as i planned on proposing on our anniversary in february. i found out later the same night, after she told me, that she has had two dating apps on her phone for a couple weeks already and that she's already been ""talking"" to guys. i told her again that i wasn't comfortable with the whole thing and i especially wasn't ok with her sleeping with other guys.

last night i asked if she wanted to fool around as our intimate life has been basically non-existent for the past month (not for a lack of trying on my part it's just that's she's never in the mood or tired) and was met with a very enthusiastic ""sure!"" followed by "" after that i'm going to go see a friend."" i was immediately turned off because i knew she meant another guy and i started getting ready to go to sleep as i worked early in the morning. she proceeded to get ready and left at 11pm. it's now 5am and i'm leaving for work and she just got home and went straight to the washroom.

i'm not sure what to do anymore.

edit: thank you to everyone who gave helpful advice, i'm still reading through everything and more keep coming. i feel like i should clarify some things.

yes, i agreed to open our relationship against better judgement because i didn't want to lose her. that meant i was able to see other people too but i choose not to because i only wanted to be with her and i made that clear to her.

despite the facts that she's had dating apps for awhile and spent time (a few hours here and there, last night was the longest) at a guy's house, she insists that nothing happened and that they're just friends who flirt with eachother... that's it.

"my bank has not yet deducted my rent payment from my account. it has been nearly 2 weeks and my apartment complex says they've been paid in full.. hello. so every month i move around $1,000 into my account and pay my rent using my apartment complex's online portal. i pay directly from the account and my understanding is that this is treated as a digital check. the apartment complex accepts payment immediately and clears my balance, and the bank itself typically takes 3 days to deduct that payment from the account. 

this past month, the bank just didn't take the money out. it's still sitting in the account i used to pay. the apartment complex confirms that i'm paid in full, and i paid a bit early last month so it's been nearly 2 weeks now since i've paid. 

i can't imagine the bank would make this kind of mistake (it's one of the bigger banks in the us), but they've never taken anywhere near this long to collect the money after my payments.

guess i'm just wondering if this is something i should be concerned about. i plan on leaving the money in there until the end of the month at minimum just to cover myself in case they deduct it. but if they don't, am i clear to assume that it's still 'my' money or do i have anything to worry about?",10
"by thinking my hoodie string was a parasitic anal worm. so today i was hanging out at my neighbors house just talking and getting to know each other. they're pretty chill and i really felt like this would lead to a great friendship.

after a couple hours of banter i started feeling my gate to the nether weakening and i knew it was time to go make a deposit into the toilet so i politely asked to go to the bathroom, a completely normal thing to do right?

they informed me that the light in there was broken so i was just like whatever i'll use my phone as a flashlight to make sure no brown substances were remaining on my crevice.

i go in there and im just going through the routine, browsing reddit, trying to make my bowel movements quiet as possible, yall know the drill. however once i reached the wiping phase, my life changed.

i commenced the first wipe like usual, checked it out with the light, i knew i'd definitely need to do some more rounds. after a few wipes, the scariest moment of my life occured.

my flashlight lit up the toilet paper and what i saw made me feel fear unimaginable by the human psyche until felt firsthand. i saw a black snake like creature wrapped around my hand, and my brain immediately thought i was infected with some kinda anal superworm.

i let out a bloodcurling shriek. one that you'd hear in the depths of hell. in my instinct driven spasm i somehow broke the toilet seat and my ass fell into the fucking toilet. i was in a primal state i can't even explain. i was desperately flaying my body around like a dying fish trying to find this ass demon but i couldn't find it anywhere.

my neighbors were extremely worried thinking i was dying of a heart attack/seizure/stroke in their bathroom, but i didn't give two shits. my inards were being harvested by some kinda alien species, why the fuck would i care what they think?

after about 45 seconds of searching for the little shit i started coming to my senses. if there really was something living in my anus, where the fuck did it go? then i looked down, and felt the worst embarrassment in my entire life.

the black, slithering, slimy, snake like worm wasn't a parasite, it was my hoodie string. i just destroyed my neighbor's toliet, screamed caveman like shouts, and threw my body around like a retarded octopus, over a fucking hoodie string.

my neighbor's concerned voice turned into a ""what the fuck are you doing in there???"" at this point and i was speechless. i tried to muster up some kind of explanation but i could only mutter ""im...im so...sor....sorry."" i was scared to open the door, but i knew it had to be done.

i opened it to see the faces of a family that won a free trip to a zoo, but got tricked into going to an insane asylum. they just stared at me. i just stared back while covered in shit water and a face of a man who survived the holocaust.

i didn't know what to say so i just muttered ""i'll see myself out."" and they didn't even respond. i silently waddled out the door and walked to my house with a broken soul.

i feel terrible. i broke their toilet and obviously need to compensate them for the damages, but i dont know if i can ever see them again without having horrible flashbacks. i truly am a lost man. i will never be the same.

tl;dr i thought my hoodie string was a parasite from my anus and broke my neighbors toliet.",4
"for wanting to divorce my transgender wife (i'm a lesbian)? update. original post over here(https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/araeds/aita_for_wanting_to_divorce_my_transgender_wife_i/)

firstly, i want to thank all of you who gave your opinions and advice. after reading some of the comments, i realised that i have left this situation for way too long. so i had a sit down with my girlfriend and my wife and we had a long, long talk.

firstly, to all those asking if my wife is pretending to be transgender in hopes that she'll become ""my type"": the answer is a big no. in fact, she doesn't have romantic feelings for me at all, which i'm so glad of. it turns out that the reason she hasn't pursued anyone in the ten years that we've been married is because she doesn't really feel romantic or sexual attraction at all, towards anyone. as a member of the lgbt community myself, i have heard of this. again, i was surprised that she had never said anything to me, but she told me that she's always felt quite ashamed of this, because it's not normal. that's why she agreed to marry me in the first place: she didn't want to marry anyone for real, and marrying me was her ticket to a single life without being judged.

secondly, i'm going to come clean to my parents. it took a lot of convincing and a lot of tears from both my girlfriend and my wife, but i told them that they've done so much for me and it was time for me to start thinking about them, and not myself. i don't feel comfortable doing it in person, so i will be telling them over the phone. to protect my wife, i will tell them all why she didn't know i was gay, and now that she's found out we will be divorcing. i will not tell them that she is transitioning. before i tell them, my wife and girlfriend will be moving in with my sister's family for a while, until it's all blown over. as much as i hope my parents will just cut me off, knowing them there will probably some harassment and it may not be safe for them to be living with me.

depending on how my parents react, i may have to move house, so that they can't track me down. i don't believe that they would physically harm me, but i'm not certain of that, and besides, there are other ways they can hurt me. 

once everything has blown over, my girlfriend and i will move back together. my wife will stay with us too, through her transition. and she's welcome to stay with us as long as she wants to after that. we'll get a divorce, so she'll finally be back to just my best friend. 

my wife is a wonderful person. my girlfriend is too, and so is my sister. i am less wonderful. but i'm thankful that i've been given a chance to put things right.

also: fuck the will.",3

he follows me around the house, stands outside the bathroom and yells for attention, stands in front of the tv while i'm trying to watch, as soon as the tv goes on, without fail, plays under our bed and makes noise constantly, is always running around our house knocking things over, and then comes and rubs up against me while i am trying to clean up the messes he makes. 

a lot of the time he will try to run between my legs while i'm walking somewhere, then gets super upset when i inevitably kick him on accident.
*what were you expecting*

it's not that i don't like him, i love the guy but his constant neediness puts me off from ever playing with him or giving him any attention at all, because he is constantly in my face and never does anything on his own. when i go to bed he will walk across our pillows, he is always just, nearby. he won't let me hold him or sit in my lap but he will always sit next to me and just look at me and it makes me uncomfortable because he will stare at me for an entire hour sometimes. he is constantly bothering our pet gerbils by swiping at the glass and it makes them nervous.

he is extremely hyper at night and sometimes gets me up at 5am because he wants food. 

i'm not sure what to do anymore. i have tried brushing him, petting him, dragging yarn around for him to chase, eventually i just resort to dumping catnip on the floor so he eats and gets sleepy.

i am at the end of my rope and not sure what to do.

tldr: stepson won't let me live my life in peace and is constantly waking me up and following me *everywhere*

"neighbor threatening to sue us for cutting down our own tree.. ohio

this january we had a giant oak tree cut down in our backyard. prior to this happening we informed our neighbors as we had to have lots of trucks and a crane blocking the street and my driveway for short periods of time during the day they cut it down. no one said anything or seemed to really care. 

the tree was a huge hazard. all winter we had been experiencing small limbs falling and we were starting to get concerned for one falling onto our house. we did have the tree trimmed every other year. but one big limbs finally fell on our patio after an ice storm, crushing our furniture and patio awning. as soon as the weather allowed - we had the entire tree cut down. we discovered that the tree was actually very unhealthy. most of the inside was decayed and there was a giant crack down the center of the base. seriously a ticking time bomb. this definitely saved our house as well as our neighbors homes. 

fast forward to the summertime, as our yards are coming into bloom and the heat is rising our ac bills. we did notice our electric bill was a little higher as we no longer have the usual shade of the tree. a small price to pay for our safety. 

our next door neighbors have essentially a botanical garden in their backyard. they are retired and spend a lot of time working on their yard and landscaping. the tree branches had previously reached over a bit of their property, but more significantly provided a lot of shade over the house and yard. 

apparently - now that their yard has gone from partial sun to full sun, a large amount of their flowers and shrubs were unable to thrive as usual. their electric bill is also effected. 

mr approached us a few times over the summer to tell us how selfish and rude we were to not consider how this would effect their yard now that there is significantly more sun. their house is also featured on our townships garden club annual tour and they decided they could not participate this year due to the ""significant losses.""

another neighbor (a much more reasonable one) said that he had approached them and asked if they would be interested in ""teaming up"" to sue for costs of lost landscaping and electric bills due to us cutting down the tree. he said no and then told us - just in case they decide to actually sue us. 

i realize this sounds completely insane. i can guarantee that the entire base and roots of the tree were on our property (no question - it was smack in the center of our yard). all that touched their property was the afternoon shade the tree provided and a few feet of branches.

we did inform them of this happening right at the beginning - i don't believe this is our fault that we prefer to spare our house and lives over their landscaping. in fact we probably spared their own home by cutting this tree down - if it fell in their direction it would have definitely hit their house too. 

is there any possible leg for them to stand on?

edit:
wow this blew up way more than anticipated! to answer the most asked questions - the tree removal company did acquire the township permits prior to removing the tree. we do not have to replace the tree - there are several other trees further back on our property.

we aren't really friendly with these neighbors - they are always looking to complain about everyone. a dog barks too loud, not cutting the grass often enough, another neighbor had their driveway re-paved that was not to their liking, once we had a party with about a dozen people and they called the cops because we parked on the street in front of their house (100% legal street parking). everything anyone does makes their life more unpleasant. 

we will just continue our lives and if we are served we will respond. i did call the tree company just to confirm any documentation they have for cutting down the tree and they still have it and said they were more than willing to assist us if there was a problem. 

thanks everyone!",2

so it's been over a month since i first posted and i thought that i'd post a last update for you guys as part of closing this chapter of my life. 

short story: my fiance and i have broken up. during pre marriage counseling he realized that he still loves his ex. she also broke off her own engagement for him. they are now back together.

i took to heart three things from the replies in my original thread. those who said i was yta told me not to look at my fiance's ex as his ex but as his friend. those who said i was nta adviced that i should talk to my fiance about my insecurities. some suggested pre marriage counseling. so i swallowed my pride and told my then fiance that his ex is welcome in our wedding because she is his friend. i also told him of my insecurities and asked if we could go to pre marriage counseling. he was supportive and agreed. 

after our second meeting with our counselor, my ex fiance talked to me. he said that counseling has made him realize that he is still in love with his ex. i was in total shock because he has always been the perfect boyfriend, i never felt like i was competing with anyone for him. he said he never meant to hurt me and that he did love me, but he could not marry me knowing that part of him will always belong to someone else. 

it's been a few weeks since we broke up and surprisingly i have been holding up well. it hurts because i miss him but i just tell myself that he's not the right one for me. i'm 23, i have my whole life ahead of me and it's an exciting new adventure to try to find the right person. 

my ex fiance and i are civil. he is a good guy and i appreciate our time together, though it sucks that it has ended. from what i know he told his ex that he still loves her and i guess she felt the same way because she also broke off her engagement to give their relationship another try. good luck to them.

so there, i just want to thank everyone who commented whether it's yta nta or nah. i had great advice from people especially those who said we should try pre marriage counseling. it changed my life. hopefully for the better.",3

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blqf6e/honestly_not_cheating/ 

my update is this. we're going to be ok, better than ok actually!!
i took some advice from posts here encouraging me to reach out to understand what was motivating her fears and also disregard much advice which encouraged me to walk away.

i reach out to her and we took four weeks from work to reconnect. we went to where we'd met and talked, and talked and talked.  after the emotional dam broke i learned that she had a deep seated feeling that she had failed me as a wife, we'd always planned children and she was completely baffled why a man as ""good as i"" would still love her if she weren't able to have them. she internalized this and despite my view that it's our problem not hers alone she felt a need to own it.

i explained to her that i was amazed that  a woman like her would be content with a man like me and how i still adore her and look forward to ever minute we have. 

long story we both realized again we each see ourselves as the lucky one in our relationship. this lead to an amazing and really liberating physical playtime, sex without the stress of reproduction just for pure love is awesome.

"usps lost our money order, landlord tells us we have to write a new check by monday. really need advice .. sorry if this isn't the right place to post, but we're pretty desperate. like the title says, we went to usps and got money orders to pay our rent ($2300) for the month. last wednesday, the super comes by to inform that they haven't received the money. after reaching back out to usps, they inform us they lost the orders. the number on the receipt the original worker circled and said was the tracking number was actually the code for the online survey. we were informed of this by an different employee yesterday as she laughed told us to get out of the line (hey, what can you do). the landlord says he needs a check on monday for $2300 and while we have been securely making rent on time since we moved in a couple months ago, we can't afford to spent another $767 each immediately after paying rent. that being said, i understand the landlords issue completely, man needs his money. i'm sure all of this makes me an idiot, but i'd greatly appreciate any help or advice. thanks a lot. 

update: we have a receipt but it only contains the individual payments alongside a serial number. this means my roommate didn't steal it and the money was actually given to the bank, right? 
i entered the serial numbers into money order inquiry system and it didn't recognize or have any information on them.",10
"for 'secretly' giving my nephew less food at a family campout because he's unhealthy?. my family do huge camping trips every year or so and we have maybe 30 little kids in our close family- we are a huge amount of brothers and sisters. 

my entire family is pretty athletic except for my youngest brother and his wife and son. my nephew is 8 years old and is terribly, terribly obese. he has joint issues on his knees, has that classic overweight knock knees stance, he's cried miserable tears to me in private before because he has to wear enormous basketball shirts and nothing else which he hates, etc.

i'm always trying to get him into physical activity, i've privately spoken to his parents because he feels left onto of his cousins games because they're all so much more mobile, etc. however they are feeders and i've personally seen them buy and feed him things that should feed a family of 4 and he's able to demolish it in one go. 

when we go on these camps we usually go for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, and this time i made sure. i was way more active in the food prep so i could monitor what he ate. he's my favorite nephew and i felt he deserves way more than this. 

i swapped out his sodas for la croix, when it was breakfast time i loaded the kid up on bacon eggs and sausage but i held back the toast and maple syrup, and when it was smores time i made sure he had some s'mores but i made them up myself with less chocolate and graham crackers and more strawberry and marshmallow. 

stuff like that. 

now my nephew is so big that i didn't see a difference, but i kept asking him how he felt every day and the one thing i wanted more for him than anything else- he told me he felt awesome and he was actually for the first time in his life running around with his peers! he would sweat like a lil grubby booger and need to take time out but he could actually play without being in tears from pain. 

at the end of the trip i talked to him and told him that i had made some small swaps to his mealtimes and wasn't it awesome that he was able to get more energy from it?? he reacted in tears, hugged me so tight that i couldn't breathe and was honestly so excited to make a grocery list with me and get the stuff he needs for home. he asked if he had lost weight and i told him that i honestly didn't know because we hadn't weighed him (he obviously has lost weight but this isn't about weight, it's about health) but i told him he probably had built up a lot of strength. 

when we told his parents my brother was super chill about it but his mom flipped. the fuck. out. and told me that i had no right to interfere with her kids food, that i should have spoken about a meal plan with them first, and that it was way inappropriate and crossing boundaries. 

the rest of my family bizarrely joined suit and told me i was way outta line and that i ruined my nephews camping trip, and the only one who seems to see no wrong in what i did is my nephew. even my more sensible siblings think i shouldn't have interfered.",3
"blend dog food and low-sodium chicken broth together and freeze it in a hollow dog toy. it will keep your dog busy and occupied for hours while also providing them a healthier treat.. edit: whoa fp!!! so many people to thank! 

i definitely want to address some of the most popular comments:

a lot of people have brought up the mess factor, in my experience my dog finishes this well before it melts, if your dog is picky or loses interest in challenging tasks quickly this might not be for them or might need to be an outside only treat.

also, definitely check your chicken broth for onions, many of you have mentioned that they are bad for doggo. my vet recommended this to me and did not mention this as a concern but i will definitely be taking this into consideration. 

kong balls/bones work best as they are very difficult for your dog to destroy. 

tl;dr: might be best to give to dogs outside; onions are bad and in broth; kong balls are where it's at!",8

"stupid question, if there were metal buildings/electronics more than 13k+ years ago, would we be able to know about it?. my friend has gotten really into conspiracy theories lately, and he has started to believe that there was a highly advanced civilization on earth, like as highly advanced as ours, more than 13k years ago, but supposedly since a meteor or some other event happened and wiped most humans out, we started over, and the only reason we know about some history sites with stone buildings, but no old sites of metal buildings or electronics is because those would have all decomposed while the stone structures wouldn't decompose

i keep telling him even if the metal mostly decomposed, we should still have some sort of evidence of really old scrap metal or something right?

edit: so just to clear up the problem that people think i might have had conclusions of what an advanced civilization was since people are saying that ""highly advanced civilization (as advanced as ours) doesn't mean they had to have metal buildings/electronics. *they could have advanced in their own ways!*"" the metal buildings/electronics was something that my friend brought up himself.",9
"we have a total wedding cost of about $8000 (which we have). is it worth getting a credit card to put it all on for the rewards? if so which one? (credit score is just under 800). we figured if we are going to drop $8000 over the course of a year (possibly all in a few months) is there a great credit card that would be worth the rewards? possibly something that could help pay for a portion of our honeymoon to scandinavia (flight or hotel). 

we don't need to put our wedding on a credit card as we have saved up and could pay cash. we both have great credit. 

also please save all wedding lectures about it being a waste of money to yourself. we do very well and 8k is modest for what we are getting. 

thank you!! 

edit 1:: i didn't expect this to blow up. thank you all for the advice. a few things i'd like to say.

thank all of you who broke down the numbers for me! i have a lot of great options. this has been my first really positive experience on reddit. 

i'd like to clear up some things people didn't read correctly in my post: 

-i am not taking out any loans!!! i have the money and could pay it all in cash right now. i tutor as a hobby and side income and it has been very profitable over the last few years. this wedding is being paid for by my enjoyment of teaching children math. 

-i am not going use any referral links so stop sending me messages with them

-i understand some people think weddings are a waste of money. but this money is literally extra and i'm not sacrificing a shred of happiness, time, or other expense paying for it. my fiancee and i are very excited to celebrate our love with a small group of family and friends modestly and intimately. 

edit 2:: 

-i will post to r/churning on wednesday when i'm allowed (they are strict)
- the main venue cost has already given us a 25% discount so asking for a deeper cash discount is greedy. though we might do that for some other stuff. 

edit 3:: 
- mod from r/churning reached out directly to me because of the popularity of this post. so thank you all (even the assholes) for making this post as big as it became 

-the internet is filled with some really mean people who have sent me really mean messages. sorry my wedding budget (which is super cheap) has offended so many of you. 

-luckily the internet is also filled with super amazing people who have been super helpful!!! i even gave my first silver to someone who deserved it. 

edit 4: thank you for the silver whoever you are! although this post has been locked due to all the sour grapes in the bunch, i'm still receiving messages from very helpful people.

"my (f25) boyfriend (m29) hates my job.. my boyfriend hates my job. i work as an animator and he never really talks about it and the rare times he does he never has anything nice to say about it. when i was in uni studying animation he always made fun of how i would never get a job either and made fun of me. i was fine with it back then but after 5 years it has honestly made me resent him. animation is a large part of my life that he just ignores.

he wont even watch an animated show or movie. an example is when into the spiderverse came out. we both love super hero films but he refused to even give it a chance because it was an animation so i had to go alone.

a recent thing we have discussed which i think has been the tipping point for me, is that i should become a sahm while he works, nothing against sahms but i am not willing to put a job i am so passionate about and have worked so hard for aside so that i can look after a child. tbh i dont even know how he thought that was a reasonable idea considering he has never been able to hold down  job since i met him.

is this just me over reacting, or is this something i should be worried about?",7
"by telling my coworker/friend that the mandatory pizza party he was called into was actually him getting fired. we work in building science. once in a while we get performance reviews, which basically consists of feedback/congratulations and free pizza. so, we had that meeting today, which means we get the day off and free pizza. it's actually a really great day to have, because pizza. nobody is getting in trouble since we're all skilled at our jobs. everyone knows this, except for one person i forgot about.

now, the coworker i'm referring to is a bit more new, and hasn't had a review day yet. he texted me asking why he's getting called in to a performance review (which admittedly sounds kind of scary). me, knowing all this time it's basically a pizza party, sarcastically told him it's because he's getting fired. me being a dumb-dumb didn't think that this would come off as serious via text message.

oh lord jesus, it did come off as serious to him. all i got as a response from him was ""wow."" and i said ""get yeeted"" or something that should have made this situation/bad joke innocuous.

today was performance day.

he comes in in a tuxedo with a costume monocle. people immediately started smirking and asking him why he's wearing a tuxedo, but he's basically just shrugging them off. naturally our boss is kind of smirking and picks him for an interview first. assuming he's getting fired, he puts on his poker face and eats pizza during the entire duration of our bosses 2-on-1 interview with him. like, in the fashion of constantly having a morsel of pizza in his mouth, with an attitude. i can see them through the office window and i'm going through a fit of a mixture of laughter and being mortified, and our two bosses were kind of unsure if they should laugh or not. their smirks turned to smiles, and then suddenly, all three of their faces are looking directly at me through the window with this stern look of confusion.

my friend gets up, flies out of the office and calls me a dick. everyone is laughing, including him. at the end of the day, everyone had a good day except for me, whose performance review started off with ""what are you 15?""

but i still got free pizza and finally saw a monocle in real life

"the city mowed my wildflower meadow! (tx). we have a property with a drainage easement that contains a detention pond, basically a 20'x20' concrete box.  this is part of the city stormwater system - the water from the street gutter goes into the detention pond to slowly absorb into the ground, absorbing some some of the street runoff and preventing erosion.  the detention pond is near the curb but behind mature trees, so it is accessed through a 70'x30' clearing adjacent to the pond.  we are in a forested area - everything except that clearing has mature trees covering it.

&#x200b;

every 5-7 years the city brings heavy equipment to dredge the pond.  they come to the door ahead of time, and i've worked with them on making sure they have adequate access to get to the pond as required by the drainage easement.  that's why the 70'x30' clearing exists.  this crew is great by the way - they know how to correctly prune trees and only clear what is necessary to get the job  done.

&#x200b;

in this cleared area, we've converted it into a wildflower meadow.  this is the optimal use for this land - wildflowers come back wonderfully on disturbed soil and this site has heavy equipment trample it up every 5 years.  my wife and i are master gardeners who have a passion for pollinators.  as this is such a forested area, there is nowhere else on our property that we have the sunny conditions necessary for these kinds of wildflowers and we have spent a great deal of time and money working on this area, including travelling around the state for pollinator host plants and other uncommon native plants to help re-establish their populations.  we've spend 2-3 hours each week since early spring weeding to make sure that this area was 100% wildflowers.

&#x200b;

yesterday (5/21/2019) we heard string trimmers operating and looked out the window to see that our wildflower area was being destroyed.  it had been completely mowed down by the time we had run out to talk to the crew.  it was an easter seals crew hired by the city to clear the detention pond.  the pond itself had very few weeds in it - it had been dredged recently and was nearly perfect.  however, they also mowed the 70'x30' clearing next to the pond... our beloved and well-maintained wildflower meadow.

&#x200b;

i spoke to the crew leader and he said that they have a list of ponds to mow, and that that some have wildflower exceptions (ours does not).  he told us who to contact at the city to get that added, i've since left that person a voice mail and haven't heard back.  i've been given empty promises from the city before (more on that later), so although this may end up being a solution, i simply do not trust the city until i have something in writing.

&#x200b;

i asked to see the map that shows where the crew is supposed to mow.  when he showed it to me, the highlighted area contained only the detention pond - the 70'x30' clearing is not in the highlighted area.  i pointed this out, and he responded with ""they always do two tractor widths on each side too"".  when pressed to define that further, he clarified it to 6 feet.  however:

1. they did not mow the entire highlighted part - some of the detention pond itself was untouched
2. they mowed more than 6' away from the detention pond
3. they only mowed the side of detention pond with the wildflower area, they did not clear any of the other 3 sides

&#x200b;

not only is all of our hard work ruined, but i know that we had monarch and pipevine swallowtail caterpillars pupating in that area that have been destroyed.  now that the wildflowers are mowed down, weeds and invasive species are going to take over and we'll have to spend more time and effort clearing those out instead of enjoying something we loved.

&#x200b;

there was no reason at all to clear the wildflower area - it does not affect the performance of the detention pond at all, nor does it prevent access.  although it is in part of the drainage easement, i don't believe that they have the right to cause damage for no reason.  i think that the city hired a poorly-trained crew (could not determine that their work was detrimental) and sent them at a time when the work wasn't needing to be done.

&#x200b;

my questions for the legal team about what can i do?  in a perfect world, the things i'd like to happen are:

\- not having the city ever send a mowing team out to my property ever again.  i'm not familiar with how easements work, i know they'll always do the heavy work every 5-7 years which is fine, but there's no need for their substandard mowing crews in times between the dredging work

\- being compensated for the damage done

\- better training for the mowing crew so that they don't cause ecological harm to future sites

&#x200b;

sidenote - the last time the city dredged the pond we were told that they would seed the clearing with rye grass seed.  instead, they dumped a load of sand and never came back.  we've since addressed it by adding loads of organic matter in the soil and finding plants that like the sandy conditions, but that was another promise broken.

&#x200b;

i've also talked to the pond inspectors who come out from time to time and they assured me that the city would not mow down the wildflowers.  nothing has ever been in writing or true.

&#x200b;

edit:  i've spoken with an easter seals supervisor and confirmed that the crew did not follow the map they were given.  the map has blue ""cut lines"" that terminate at the detention pond.  the crew is not supposed to go beyond that.  the entire wildflower area is outside of the designated cutting area",2
"being charged a $100 restocking fee on an order i cancelled immediately. do i have any recourse?. edit 3: since numerous people keep asking, this is how i was able to resolve it:
- i spoke with 3 different reps about cancelling my order. the first said they couldn't cancel orders and that i must wait for the product to arrive then schedule a return.
- i reached out again and the second rep confirmed they are able to cancel, but would charge a 15% restocking fee. after i politely informed the rep that i did not believe i should be charged this fee, i was transferred to a third rep. 
- this rep essentially repeated what the second rep said, and i politely asked for my case to be escalated.
- a manager reached out to hear my case. i explained everything calmly and he agreed that the restocking fee didn't make sense in my case. he double checked my order and confirmed it hadn't processed yet, and no product had moved. he stated they would process the cancellation as normal.
- i received an email shortly after confirming the cancellation. the refund was posted to my credit card, and no restocking fee was charged.

**edit 2: i appreciate the continued support and advice hours later, but i've successfully remedied the situation. all good here. thanks!!**

edit: i was polite yet persistent and was able to get my order cancelled without a fee. i'll definitely do my research in the future before ordering from a new place. thanks to everyone for the advice!

i ordered a tv on dell's website and decided against it an hour later. i contacted them about cancelling an order and a rep stated that i will be charged a 15% restocking fee, or about $100.

when i asked for a link to this policy, they referred me to their return policy. i stated that i am not returning anything because i don't have the product, merely cancelling an order. but they refuse to not charge the ""restocking"" fee.

is there anything i can do in this scenario? it feels like a scam to make some money off of cancelled orders. i should add the order is still ""processing"" so they've essentially done nothing with the actual order so far, yet need to charge to ""restock"" it.",10

"if you find yourself lost in unfamiliar wilderness, immediately stop and begin marking your location - break brush, organize branches, or stones, or dig trenches into clear man made shapes. people who are lost often begin to wander, and this strategy marks the first location you realized you were lost for both yourself and possible searchers. title is a bit messy, but obviously terrain and environment will dictate the materials available to use for marking your location. make your marking clear enough it will be able to withstand rain/weather, ideally for multiple days or even weeks. 

once you have established your ""home base"", you may begin searching for the trail or other signs of human activity. it is incredibly important however to do this with a calm and collected mind, not panicking and trying to push yourself in a random direction in desperate hope. begin slowly, and always count your steps. mark your path away from your ""home base"" as you move, so that there is a clear way back. at first, only try say 20 steps in as straight as a line as you can manage, before returning to your home base. now try a line in the opposite direction, 20 steps and return. this approach is much safer with a compass, as you can stick to cardinal directions and there is less chance of you becoming turned around. always be marking your passage, and always try to return to your base as it is much more likely to be close to where people would be traveling or looking for you.

"landlord is shouting at pet sitter. i live in massachusetts.  my wife and i have been renting the same property for at least eight years.  we've always had a cat, which was permitted when we moved in.  the landlord lives on the second floor of the house, in a different apartment.

we go away on weekends with some regularity, and at the end of one such weekend this year, our landlord cornered my wife outside (i was such inside the bathroom...) and started claiming that we had a non-permitted second cat (untrue,) and said that we shouldn't have a cat if we weren't going to stay home and take care of it.  he went on to say that he didn't want us giving spare keys to anybody, which is obviously a requirement for a pet sitter.

we didn't believe he had the power to make such rules, and decided to just keep doing what we were doing, and look for a house on the side (the housing market near boston is its own horror story.)  well, this weekend, our sitter texted to report that when he went to the apartment, our landlord spotted him and started shouting at him.  we don't have the full story yet, but we do know that the kitty was fed.

on the other hand, my wife and her ex husband have nothing saved up for my stepdaughter. she asked me if i would add my sd as a recipient because the sum is quite large. i told her that my late wife contributed a lot to the fund and she wanted it to go to my daughter. she's upset because i'm being biased now. i think this is something which was planned a long time ago, even before i met my current wife. also, it was something my late wife put a lot of effort into. here?

edit: edited ages. my daughter was 6mo old when her mother passed away.

edit2: we all agreed that my wife and her ex would pay for sd's college. i'm totally responsible for all her day to day expenses and other miscellaneous stuff, but not long term investments. we were always clear about that part.

"police at my door with a search warrant for my dad who hadn't lived here for 10 years..what should i have done?. this happened in england. 2 riot vans and about 15 police officers showed up at my house after arresting my dad for 'prevention of criminal damage' as he was planning to handcuff himself to railings outside a meeting to protest some climate thing.

he gave them my family home as his even though he hasn't actually lived here for almost a decade, they showed me the warrant, i told them he doesn't live here, they didn't care and came in anyway, they searched my house found old pictures of my dad and used it to say i was lying to them about him living here.

apparently they used some anti terror laws to action the search warrants for the protesters that they shouldn't of and all of the protesters where released with no charges, thing was...i had quite a large chunk of hash and a half ounce of stinky stinky bud which they took from me and arrested me for, so turned out i was the only one who got any charges out of this whole fiasco and i'm pissed off about it.

 update - some people seem to want to know where they found my stash, good tactics by the officer i guess, before anyone else came in when it was just me and him, he asked me 'is there anything we're going to find here that we shouldn't be finding son?' 

i with every fibre in my body screaming how wrong it was reached under the computer desk and slid out my tray, handed him 2 1/2 ounces of hash which he brought it up to his eye level and said 'fuckin hell son, thats a big lump'.

"should i tell my dying husband i'm pregnant?. super final update: (11/23/19) not sure if anyone will ever check this post again, but for anyone who finds it in the future, steve passed a few days ago. we're all okay. things are ok. i'm doing fine. paperwork is a bitch. i'm caught up on laundry. everyone who read my comment that steve and sara were watching stranger things season 3 and didn't warn me about the ending can die in a reddit fire. it was traumatic. what a world. :)

final(ish) update: found out i'm like 15 weeks pregnant not 4. baby is a girl. she will be loved and a welcome part of our family. i will tell steve. feel free to keep commenting as i enjoy commenting back, but the decision has been made. thanks everyone

bonus update: i've gotten like 5 messages that you can't tell sex of the baby that early, and y'all can go take it up with the tech who seemed pretty fucking sure of herself.

original post:

(sorry i posted this like an hour ago and then got super paranoid my older son was going to see it so i deleted it, but i just low-key found out he doesn't even go on reddit anymore so i'm going to try this again. thank you to the couple of people who responded before i took it down, i've saved all your replies.) (also changed my throwaway so it meets the new rules i think)

hey this is really shitty but i'm 39f and mother of two teens, and married to a (40m) guy i'll call steve. sorry if this is all a mess, it's a bit of a messed up story

the marriage was basically one of convenience. steve and i are both divorced and have been friends for decades. this past spring steve found out he has a rare cancer and the doctors gave him 6ish months to live.

three years ago steve sought out the daughter he had before his marriage from a one night stand in his 20s. when he found her he discovered his daughter (10 years old, i'll call her sara), was being horrifically abused by her mother, who had had some kind of mental break i guess. anyway he spent a year fighting for custody of this child he hadn't seen since she was a baby, and he eventually got it, then spent 2ish years working with her and getting her to heal and trust him and surprise! he's fucking dying.

anyway the marriage thing was mostly about sara. we were advised that is getting married would be the quickest/easiest way to make sure i get custody of sara when steve passes, in case sara's mother decides to try for custody again.

and as a side note i 100% do want custody of sara, no question, i love her very very much. she's already like a sister to my two kids and similar in age. that girl has gone from not owning a fucking pair of shoes to being a funny, smart, all around great kid.

anyway we got married on paper (no wedding), and steve and sara moved into my house. all the kids knew what was happening and were surprisingly cool with it.

yeah so, stuff happened between me and steve. he confessed he had been in love with me for a long time, and i just kind of said it all back to him even though i'm not 100% sure of my feelings. it all just happened fast idk. maybe that was wrong of me but i wanted his time left to be happy and i do care for him a lot

in the last few weeks steve has gone downhill very quickly. he is still mostly at home except for a few short hospital stays. there are nurses that come every day and he is on strong pain medicine, so sometimes he's himself but a lot of times really out of it. he's basically just here dying right in front of my fucking eyes and it sucks.

and i just found out this week that i'm pregnant. i'm not sure that i want to keep the baby. i'm old as dirt with now 3 teenage kids to think of. i'm strongly considering not telling steve at all, but it feels very wrong.

telling him also feels wrong. he's more upset about leaving sara than he is about dying, so finding out he's leaving another kid behind will probably only hurt him.

having an abortion feels wrong. keeping the kid feels wrong. nothing about this is okay and i really just want a cigarette and a bottle of wine.

tl;dr hahahaha life sucks

update: i am pretty sure i'm going to keep the baby and tell steve, but i want to sleep on it first (also steve is definitely out for the night). thanks for listening. going to do the dishes, feed the cat, and go to bed. will continue to read and respond to comments when i can and hopefully update at some point before the weekend.

update update: saw obgyn this morning way too early (seriously why are you even open at 8am?) and here's the twist: i'm not a month pregnant, i'm like 3+ months pregnant. no i'm not relieved, i'm pissed off that i had another choice taken away from me. i'm sick of my life feeling like a speeding train that i have no control over. i'm sick of everyone romanticising everything. i'm tired of everyone saying i'm strong when i feel like i'm just doing the bare minimum to keep my head above water. i'm just gonna be angry for a little while, thx",7
"t-mobile charged me $1600 dollars... but has no record of it? help please. i'm not positive that this is the right sub to ask, so if it's not i'll post it somewhere else.

okay, so here's the deal. on sunday (9/16) i called t-mobile to sign up for a plan a purchase a phone. gave them my information, things were going along just fine, and then there was a snafu when they tried to process my payment. the rep tried a few times, and it still wasn't going through. we eventually figured out that bank of america had flagged it for potential fraud and i had to manually approve it to get it to go through. i did, but the t-mobile rep said they still had not been able to process my payment. 

except... the money was charged on my end. three times. 

the first one was automatically reversed by the bank, since it was flagged as potential fraud (as i understand it, i don't actually know if that's how it worked). the other two charges (798.84 each) have been in processing limbo since sunday. bank of america says they can't do anything until the charges post, and t-mobile has been giving me the run around since sunday night. i can't exactly blame the reps themselves for not knowing what to do, since the processing snafu on their end resulted in zero record  of the transaction. a t-mobile account was not created for me and no order has been processed. what i am irate about is that the t-mobile reps keep proposing solutions and then there is no follow up. 

wednesday they were supposed to send an email to both me and my bank detailing the situation, and they haven't.

today i got a hold of a supervisor who was supposed to investigate the situation and then call me back at 2:30. guess what didn't happen. 

i've now currently been on hold for an hour and a half with the financial department, and i have no idea what avenues are left for me to pursue. 

since the $1600 is still ""processing"" it hasn't left my account, but... it's not available to me, right? how do i get this resolved? i'll answer any questions to explain the situation more, but i'm starting to get seriously stressed about this. 

edit: my main concern is that this payment should not be taking 5 days to process, right? if i should give it more time to resolve itself i will, but at what point am i actually supposed to worry? 

update: wow this really blew up, thank you everybody! y'all were right, i just had to wait it out. i woke up this morning and the preauth/holds were gone! i have since then signed up for a credit card and i'm looking to change banks as well. ",10

"aita for photoshopping a picture of my girlfriend.. so about a month ago i was talking to guy in work. hes a pretty fit guy like myself and we were talking about gym routines. 

id seem a picture of him on facebook and he has almost perfect physic and i was asking his secrets. 

he explained to me that it wasnt all him and showed me an app on his phone that he used to edit his pictures and give him that extra boost. the app was free so i downloaded it. 

it was pretty good and i showed my gf the pics and she thought they we pretty good too. over the coming weeks i got a bit obsessed about editing pics of myself and then got bored with it, never shared a picture with anyone other then her and the guy in work. one day i was again  bored watching some program i eith the gf so started to play with it again. edited myself, the cat and a few pictures of my gf. 

even though she is also in good shape ( we gym or so oyher activity ever other day) i gave her a flatter stomach, pinched waste and bigger boobs. after a while id thought i'd done a good job and showed it to her, she was not impressed at all asked why id done it. i explained i was bored with the tv programme and wonder what she would look like with bigger boobs. 

she got  annoyed tunned of the programme and went upstairs to watch it. 

am i the arsehole?

edit.

fristly i think my girlfriend is beautiful. this wasnt for me wanting to change her. i also did other pictures like long arms and making my cat super fat.

we spoke about 30 minutes later and i apologised as i never intended to upset her. we are cool and she knows i think shes beautiful.

ive asked her to stop engaging more than convos with these friends but she can't do that for me so why should i. 

any help?

edit: we've been dating for 8 months and we are both serious and both of us have real feelings for each other but what bothers me the most is she is engaging in more than just convos with these guys wether her intentions are just friendly it obviously won't sit right with me. 

update: we've talked and agreed that it's fine that we talk to the opposite gender, ive asked her multiple times to keep it to a certain limit because i certainly only keep casual convos within work and that's it. i've heard from co-workers that she's always with other guys during her breaks and they've been touchy. and that my co-worker was confused that she was in relationship and doing what she is doing. 

she thinks all of this is fine because she tells me what is happening and she says she has no intentions that are sexual and are just ""friends"" and will not cut them off or even put a limit to it.

"california - my house burnt down, i'm being threatened by the home builder for infringing on their ip because it is being rebuilt.. this is in cookie cutter suburbia, in california.

the overall story is a bit messy, so i will keep this as short and to the point as possible. 

my homeowners insurance is helping me out here, so i ""have a lawyer"" but i wanted to see what you folks thought of this, as i have a phone meeting with my insurance company's lawyer tomorrow.

here's what's going on:

* my house burnt down early this year. total loss. no one was injured, but all my personal belongings are just gone.
* the source of the fire was electrical related (not my fault). the fire department said it was likely a charging lithium battery (my homeowners insurance is dealing with that situation) 
* the house is only 3 years old. 
* i purchased the house brand new, had some semi-custom things done to it, and actually had a great time with the home builder


two months ago, once the dust settled, i reached out to the home builder (who is well known) to see how we could acquire the blueprints for my home...or at a minimum, the blueprints for my model. i also inquired about how i could engage them to rebuild my home as i am not planning on moving out of this neighborhood (i really like it here). 

they took my info and said that they would get back to me. a few days later i heard from them regarding me/my insurance hiring them to rebuild. they said they are not set up for that and would like to help, but could not...bummer, but no big deal. i once again inquired about the blueprints. they said they would have to get back to me.

eventually they got back to me after several days and said that they would not release the blueprints to me as they are their intellectual property. serious bummer, but whatever...

my insurance company found a local reputable home builder and they started the rebuild 5 weeks ago. 

last week i got a cease and desist letter (with a threat to sue) form the original home builder saying that i/we were infringing on their intellectual property, they specifically called out the design of the house. basically they know (due to the home being in an hoa) that the house will be designed back to the exact way it was before the home burned down.

soooooo, i have a meeting tomorrow with my homeowners insurance lawyer regarding this situation. 

have any of you ever heard of such a crazy situation? what can i expect out of this situation? my agent said she has never encountered anything like this before and she's dealt with tons of total losses for homes that get rebuilt.

does the original home builder have any legal legs to stand on here?",2
"ca update yesterday i received a dui. the police claimed i was in the driver seat of the vehicle, and claimed i attempted to run out afterwards. however, i have no recollection of this event.. in my earlier thread, i received a letter in the mail from the da regarding the dui and what i did. i also got about 60 pieces of mail-spam from prospective lawyers who wanted to take my case. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/763ghw/ca_yesterday_i_received_a_dui_the_police_claimed/

"should i leave the job i love for more money?. i really love my job. i love what i do. i believe it has meaning. my coworkers are mostly awesome. our ""clients"" are awesome. i've gotten 3 promotions in 6 years and doubled my salary. i have a young child at home and they are understanding of the demands on my time. my office is 20 minutes away from my home. i have it good.

that said - i'm kinda underpaid. i recently got an offer to make 20% more. we don't need the money to survive but it would mean paying off debt and being home owners a little sooner which would be nice.

i'm torn. i'm nervous i won't like the new job and new coworkers as much. i'm nervous they will be less flexible and i would have to sacrifice my family time more often. there is opportunity for more money and more experience but is that worth it?

if anyone has made a similar decision i'd love to hear how it turned out. would love to hear from anyone but especially working mothers.

**update** 

wow, thank you all for the advice. i've read and thought carefully about what each of you said. i think i didn't realize that 20% is not that substantial. i've taken a large pay cut before for my happiness which is how i ended up at my current job in the first place. since then, i've gotten married and had a child and i guess i felt a certain obligation to earn as much as possible. but i agree with those saying 20% is not worth the uncertainties.

i'm still going to go to the second interview just to see if i really hit it off with the people or they have some kind of amazing work-from-home option that would significantly increase my quality of life but outside of these two things the 20% increase alone is not enough to take the job. (it was offered unofficially pending a second interview that they said was a ""formality"".)

**mini update**

i'm continuing to read your responses and i will still take the second interview with more of an eye at interviewing them. i'm curious how many of you that say you would take the risk have a young child at home?

also, i would never use this offer to leverage a raise at my current place. i believe this is a great environment because people love the mission and are generally the type to forgo a little extra money for the sake of fulfillment. it's competitive to work here but not because of the money. i feel that kind of move would be frowned upon.",10

"use ""c.a.r"" or ""s.t.a.r"" in job applications & interviews. this thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/5m9zwd/i_got_a_job_interview/) inspired me to post this tip...

car(https://www.bluesteps.com/blog/car-interview-technique-key-to-landing-executive-job.aspx)

car is context, action, result 

star(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/situation,_task,_action,_result)

star is situation, task, action, result.

---

when applying for jobs, you **need** to give examples if you can; it's alright saying ""i would do ..."" but it's much better to say ""i did ..."".

using this technique, i went from never hearing back from job applications to being inundated with replies and offers...albeit ""starter jobs"" but you've got to start somewhere...

i'm not saying this is a magical one-stop-solution, but it may help.

question: ""how would you deal with conflict resolution?""

answer:

context: ""working as a front desk receptionist, i recall a time where a customer came in really aggressive and angry because his money was stopped""

action: ""i looked into the situation, and found that he needed to provide xyz, and explained how to do so""

result: ""customer left happy, came back with the documents and was happy knowing his payment would be resumed"". 

this works just as well in applications, as the interview itself.

"(kentucky) teacher mentioned my brother by name, said smoking pot resulted in him getting addicted to drugs and eventually commit suicide. he is alive and healthy in medical school.. my brother was kind of famous in school. great academically and in sports. really sucks for me because i'm expected to follow in his footsteps and always fall short.

this teacher was warning us of the dangers of smoking pot and basically went on to describe everything my brother did during school, even mentioned his first name, then said his mistake in life was smoking pot and having sex before marriage which led him down the path of debauchery and self-destruction. teacher said he finally committed suicide last year and he was present at the funeral, wishing he'd done something!

aaand my brother is alive and well. talked to him just 2 hours ago. he never smoked pot, never had drug addiction and most importantly never committed suicide! i stayed in class to tell the teacher that he was mistaken but he said ""who are you to question me? you think you know better than me?""

luckily, she has first-aid training and knew what to do. but there was so much blood. it spilled onto the floor when she asked me to come out and sit on the toilet lid so she could treat it, and i was naked too. even though we're both girls, i still felt a bit uncomfortable.

she ended up spending half an hour just getting the blood to stop. the whole time i was trying not to panic. i'm prone to panic attacks, and this was freaking my the fuck out. especially since the room now looked like someone had been murdered.

instead of deflecting the question by saying something like, ""they just are,"" i for some bizarre reason felt the need to tell them the whole story. i blame this on being so preoccupied trying to find the old-maids in the bottom of the bowl my mind simply switched to auto-pilot and i completely forgot who i was talking to:

""old maids are women who've never been popped.""

""what do you mean they've never been popped?""

""i mean they've never had sex. you know, never popped their cherry.""

this was the moment my sister (who was apparently listening to the conversation from the next room) rushed into the kitchen. i was jolted out of my intense concentration by her shouting my name and saying, ""stop. stop talking now!!!""

only now the kids were full of follow-up questions: ""why do girls have cherries?"" ""do i have a cherry?"" ""what does having sex mean?""  ""why does uncle \my name\  eat the old maids? they don't look like cherries."" on and on.  yes, i am totally embarrassed and could do nothing but stutter and stammer while my sister continues begging me to shut the hell up.

tl;dr  while eating popcorn i thoughtlessly describe to a 5 and 7-year-old how unpopped kernels of popcorn are like old women who've never been fucked.

edit: a few have commented thinking i pulled the definition of ""old maid"" out of thin air and are slamming me for not understanding female anatomy, being incredibly offensive, etc. etc.  i was merely recalling what my father told me and what i heard oft-repeated among guy friends as a kid. apparently some people think a ""tifu"" should be a thoughtful socially sensitive missive.",4
"for being upset that my boyfriend shouts at my friends for not following his american customs when we live in england?. long time lurker, desperately need outside judgement on this because all my real life responses are so mixed.

i (22f) have been with my boyfriend (30) for a few months now. he moved to england just over two years ago. i really like the guy but he has so many issues regarding english 'culture'/norms and he's making no effort to change them.

we went out with my friends for dinner last week at a really popular british chain. two of the people we went out with work at other branches of the same chain. we all ate our meals and had a great time, but after we all left my boyfriend was in a real mood. we were heading to a bar to get some drinks and out of nowhere he just snapped 'i think it's absolutely disgusting that not one of you left a tip, do you know how much those wait staff earn?'. one of my friends who works at another branch said 'over £8 an hour?' (a couple of pounds above minimum wage) and he just sulked. when we got home that night he was still moody, and i tried to explain to him that we just don't really tip here very often because the servers get paid hourly. he thinks it's disgusting.

he also has an issue with me just being on the pill. in england, people in committed relationships with no stds tend to just use one form of contraception **(note: i'm not looking for judgement on whether these norms are right or not)** and for me, my preferred one is the pill. he went crazy about this, saying that we have to use condoms (changed his mind later that night when he wanted sex) and where he's from taking just the pill is 'begging to be pregnant'.

he does things like this a lot. there's smaller examples, like getting pissed off when my brother (who is 18, legal age to drink here) drinks alcohol in front of him. my sister is at university and he refuses to call it anything but 'college' when college here is something you do before you're able to go to uni (and is typically, at least in my part of the uk, seen as something less academic students do).

i know that he's being rude and i'm not the asshole for that, but we recently had a fight about it in which i declared 'if the only thing you like about this country is the free healthcare and that they speak english, you should fuck off'. since then, he's been really upset. i don't think he knows how annoying he was. for shouting at him rather than speaking?

&#x200b;

edit: he said we have to use condoms alongside the pill and went on a rant about how one form isn't enough. i don't have an issue with condoms.",3
"for refusing to show my receipt when leaving a store?. just recently, our local walmart and target have begun to ask for receipts as patrons are leaving the store. at first i would oblige. i thought ""whatever, it will only take a few seconds, nbd"". but as it happens more and more, i'm starting to realize not everyone is being asked to do this. often times i'm having my groceries checked against my receipt as i watch multiple people walk right past us.

i thought maybe they were just looking over receipts whenever possible. but one time the ""greeter"" wasn't busy with anyone else. i watched 4 or 5 shoppers walk right out without a word from her, but as i was about to leave, she asks me aside.

at this point i start thinking, i'm a young male shopping alone, maybe i'm being profiled. so, after she asks politely to see my receipt i respond with ""no thanks."" and continue out of the store. she looked a little puzzled, but...

wow, nothing happened. that's an awful lot more convenient than being ""nice"". so, that's been my default response for the past few weeks. a greeter asks me to provide my receipt and i say ""no thanks/no/nope/nah/maybe next time/etc."" with no issues. that is, until last night.

i was on my way home from work, when my roommate asks me to pick up a jar of peanut butter. so, i get to the store, find the peanut butter, ring myself up, pay, and make my way to the doors. as i'm leaving, an older man says ""hold up! let me see your receipt."", to which i respond ""nah."", and continue on my way. he stands up from his chair, raising his voice just a little, and says ""you need to pay for that!"", and i respond ""i did, have a good night!""

this is when it gets a little weird. he's clearly unconvinced, and begins to yell ""you have to show me your receipt!"" while following me out into the parking lot. i stop, turn around, and say ""i paid for this, it's my property now, transaction complete"". he just gets even angrier, demanding that i show him my receipt, yelling ""you have to pay for that"" and ""you have to show me your receipt"" non stop.

eventually i make it to my car, which he proceeds to stand in front of. now, he's saying he's going to call the police, yadda yadda. i roll down my window and tell him ""that's fine, you can call them, i don't mind. can you get away from my car?"", and he responds ""like hell i will!"" while slamming his hands onto the hood of my car.

at this point i just want to go home. i look around my car and there are no people or cars anywhere nearby. so i quickly reverse my car away from him, and high tail it out of there.

after recounting this story to my roommates, they said i was a total prick about it. they think that since it would have only taken a second to confirm that i paid for the peanut butter, that means i should have just shown him my receipt and been done with it. 

but i think that's bullshit. these stores shouldn't operate on the assumption that i'm a thief by default.

"amazon seller lost $$$ ""because of my call"". quick story: i paid over $1000 to have a uv filter installed.  i decided, against manufacturer's suggestion, to install a generic uv bulb that was listed on amazon to be ""100% compatible"" to save a few bucks. after many months of the bulb working as described, we found the bulb had completely melted and blown out of the uv unit. when we noticed no water in the sink, we went to the crawl space to find water everywhere and the bulb 10 feet from the uv unit... and the bulb was totally melted.  i called the installer, they said they've never seen anything like this happen before (they even came to see it) and it had been a few years, so i should contact the manufacturer.   manufacturer could tell by the photo it wasn't their bulb and also said they've not seen something like this happen before, so they blamed the generic bulb.

so, i went back to my amazon purchase of said generic bulb and contacted the seller through amazon.  they informed me this was not their fault and they could send me a replacement bulb.  i wrote them back, trying to continue the conversation since i didn't need a new bulb for a broken uv unit.  i waited a few weeks and no reply... so i called amazon and asked them to put me in contact with the seller.  amazon said i should get a call from the seller within a few business days.  i waited a week.  so i called amazon again and told them no one called me and asked what could they do.  so amazon refunded my money and said to get in contact with the company directly if i could.  

the company is listed under a different name online than it is on amazon. it was tricky to find them, but finally, i searched their logo pic on google and found the company.  i contacted them and almost immediately they wrote me back and said that because i contacted amazon instead of them, amazon destroyed almost $20k of their product and wanted to know what i was going to do about it... umm... i tried to contact them, they didn't contact me back, and i have 0 control over what amazon does - and how was i supposed to contact them directly when their name online is different than on amazon.  yes, i complained about them to amazon for not getting back to me, and had to explain what happened with the bulb to get request them to call me, and then again to get my refund.

"for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?. hello,

&#x200b;

i wanted to ask: for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?

&#x200b;

last month i took part in a retreat. the location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. there was a deaf participant from russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. so he asked me if i could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.

i have limited mobile data, i get 500mb per month and from there on, i pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). i only use mobile data for whatsapp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. 

so i agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for whatsapp. no videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. he agreed.

&#x200b;

but when i got lasts month bill i was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6gb additionally. i was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. but before confronting him via facebook, i asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. he told me that this russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. i asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.

&#x200b;

so i don't know what to do. the bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. and i told the deaf guy in advance to only use whatsapp, but i didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. in addition, my friend told me that i should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...",3

i decided to make pot cookies for the weekend so on friday i  cooked up a bunch of those crackling suckers.
i enjoyed them yesterday evening while watching fringe, and left the cookie box on the counter, open. 
now the dumbass i am forgot to put away the box, so it stayed open in my room the whole day, which usually is no problem since i keep the door closed. i forgot it open and at four i noticed the cookies are gone. i decided not to tell my mother since the dog seemed to do fine but about two hours later he started to breathe heavily and couldn't walk anymore. i told my mother what's up and that i believed he ate the drug cookies. she started crying and shouting about what the hell i was thinking and how my dog will die.

tl;dr my dog ate hash cookies, and now i'm worried he's gonna die and i'm crying over my good boy

update: the vet said the dose is pretty high even for that big boy, so he's gonna have to sleep it off at their clinic but will be fine. he's in good hands and the vet said he will have something for the munchies and pink floyd running, too. thank you all for the advice.

update 2: we just went to pick mah good boah up, he's doing fine but gives off a funky and mellow mood. he just looked at me and winked, i think he knows what he did. i'm afraid he'll grow dreadlocks now.
to those asking, yes i apologized to my mother, she's still very disappointed.  i will come up with the veterinary expenses myself and will never again leave edibles around.",4
"what is the legal definition of a sandwich?. certain unscrupulous individuals that i am aquatinted with have recently asserted that in some jurisdictions (namely new york)  burritos are sandwiches. 

this is clearly a scurrilous lie.

thus i ask you good people of reddit, what is the legal definition of a sandwich?

i have provided this handy chart(http://imgur.com/5yzskj5) for reference purposes.

edit: at the request of /u/foxhunter i am changing the location to tennessee. it's a race for gold people.

edit 2:

full definition given by /u/justsomebadadvice

here is an attempt at a definition that includes all things commonly referred to or thought of as ""a sandwich"" and excludes all things not commonly thought of as sandwiches.

first two definitions to help:

 • bread: a ""bread"" in this parlance refers to any grain-based dough that has been baked either by itself or with other ingredients added to it that do not constitute the sandwich ""filling.""

 • filling: any ingredient or ingredients normally eaten by human beings that is used to differentiate between ""two pieces of bread"" and a sandwich.

** bread may be made of corn instead of grain if corn is merely substituted for grain using a grain-based dough receipe.

and now the definition:

 1. a sandwich is a single piece of bread or two pieces of bread(of roughly equal size) that and surrounds a filling on both the top and bottom as it is eaten, where the bottom of the sandwich is gripped by thumb(s) and the top is gripped by finger(s).

 2. the bread must have been baked prior to being combined with the filling(i.e., no calzones)

 3. where the sandwich is one (rather than two) pieces of bread, the filling must be typically found in two-bread sandwiches in the same form. (i.e., no burritos)

 4. where substituted as a low-carb option, lettuce can be substituted for bread provided nothing else is changed and filling is the same as is typically found in two-bread sandwiches.

things included in definition:

 1. grilled cheese sandwiches

 2. pb&j sandwiches

 3. submarine sandwiches

 4. ice cream sandwiches

 5. meat, cheese, and cracker sandwich

 6. wraps, flatbread sandwiches, pita wraps, and gyro's (when eaten as one).

 7. hotdogs when consumed by turning them on their side and eaten as a sandwich.

 8. melts and panini's

 9. chicken salad sandwiches and tuna sandwiches.

 10. blt sandwiches.

 11. lettuce wraps aka unwiches when folded and eaten as sandwiches.

 12. sloppy joe's

 13. quesadilla's if eaten as a sandwich.

 14. oreo cookies and other sandwich cookies, if the cookies were baked prior to joining the filling

things not included in definition:

 1. tacos(how eaten)

 2. burritos (rule #3)

 3. calzones (prior baking)

 4. poptarts (prior baking)

 5. salads (improper bread).

 6. ravioli (prior baking, how eaten)

 7. chicken wings(fucking colorado) and fried foods. (how eaten, one or two pieces of bread)

 8. pizza (bread surrounding, how eaten, prior baking)

 9. the double down is not a sandwich. it is the shame of the u.s. (and the pride of 'murica).

 10. burger bowls & taco salads. (how eaten)

 11. stuffed grape leaves(rule 4)

 12. chili in a bread bowl(how eaten)

 13. dumplings(prior baking)

 14. uncrustables(prior baking)

 15. pigs in a blanket(prior baking)

i have no idea who created the term ""open faced sandwich"" but it is an abomination. it is either ""x on y"" or ""x and y"" ala bagel & cream cheese or buttered toast or eggs on toast.

i was unable to exclude quesadillas without also excluding other things that are functionally identical to sandwiches(wraps/grilled cheese), and i was unable to include uncrustables without also including calzones.

"by claiming tea that wasn't mine, leading to a colleague taking offense and hundreds of pounds worth of damage to my workplace.. me and my boss have a pretty great relationship. lots of banter, elaborate practical jokes- it makes the working environment a much better place. between us, that is. 

i'm the only one to have that kind of back-and-forth with him. all my colleagues (much older polish men who generally don't speak english very well, save for one or two who act as translators) he's always brusque and professional. the polish workers are the first at the factory and the last to leave, so he often writes hand-written instructions for the work they have to complete; as such, they're familiar with his handwriting, a fact which will become important later on.

this morning, whilst making myself and my colleague piotr a cup of tea as he operated a machine, my boss comes into the canteen. piotr brings in his own tea. it's some kind of special infusion citrus aroma thing, it smells nice, lots of pictures of flowers on the outside, pretty expensive stuff. my boss asks me whose tea it is. 

i could have told him it was piotr's and that would have been the end of it. but, for reasons inexplicable even to myself, i found myself telling him it was mine. perhaps i knew that he would crack a few jokes over it and wanted some early morning entertainment. maybe my brain was still only half-awake and it was a genuine mistake. whatever the cause, i found myself claiming ownership, and- as expected- received a barrage of well-meaning abuse. i chuckled, put the tea back and returned outside with a cup for myself and for piotr.

what i will now tell you i have managed to piece together through talking to others, my own detective work, and some natural deduction. at lunchtime piotr and two of his friends were crowded around the cupboard in the canteen, all talking animatedly. piotr was shouting whilst his friends seemed to be trying to placate him. it seems that my boss, believing the tea to be mine, took it upon himself to tape the following label to the tin:

https://imgur.com/a/tqkca

now my boss telling me this was a simple expression meaning he thought it was ridiculous tea. due to a cruel twist of fate, however, piotr- the tea's true owner- is a homosexual who it seems had left his last job due to cruel and constant taunting over his sexual orientation. he believed the expression 'shove it up your arse' to be targeted at his homosexuality. it seems he went on a rant in polish, questioning which of his friends told our boss, asking how dare he put that on his tea, declaring that simply because he was gay did not mean that he took pleasure from throwing anything he could get his hands on up there. the more he shouted, the angrier he got, until he stormed from the building into his car to eat his lunch alone.

this is yet another cruel twist of fate, leading me to wonder whether all these coincidences really weren't coincidences after all but some kind of cosmic joke beyond my understanding. last night piotr had bought himself a bottle of krupnik, a polish alcohol, on his way home from work and had forgotten to take it out of his car. as such it remained when he entered for his lunch, and in his anger and frustration he decided one drink couldn't hurt and before he knew it the man was inebriated. my boss, out of the factory at lunchtime to buy himself fish and chips, was unaware of the events unfolding.

immediately after lunch piotr was needed on the forklift. this i wasn't witness to, but it seems as soon as the vehicle lurched backwards some people guessed what had happened and ran to stop him; alas, it was too late. all i heard was a tremendous crash that echoed around the factory, and running out found that the forklift had careered into- and straight through- the factory doors. 

piotr has walked out of the factory in a rage and hasn't returned since. my boss, learning what had happened, is now looking for me, furious and in need of a scapegoat. i am currently hiding in the toilets and will remain here until the end of the day. 

tl;dr i told my boss i owned some tea which wasn't mine, he left a note telling me to shove it up my arse, a gay polish man took it as discrimination, got drunk and crashed a forklift through the factory doors, completely destroying them.



update: with little left to do today anyway i have slunk out of the back door unnoticed and driven home. some may call this cowardly: those people would be correct. there is another reason i didn't go talk to my boss and piotr, though. when i left the toilets i could hear them having a screaming match along with one of piotr's friends in the canteen. with my boss so angry and feeling guilty, he may well have fired me in front of the other workers; being a proud man, i think it would then be very unlikely for him to take me back. i'm leaving in 6 weeks anyway, but i need that next paycheck! anyway, it'll be safer to talk in the morning.

here's a picture of the ruined door since covered up by plasterboard. i've blacked out details of the company i work for.

http://imgur.com/a/8mf0a



final update: okay, so thankfully things seem to have gone swimmingly. coming into work this morning my boss called me into his office. instead of a tirade, i apologised for him and started to explain, and he cut me off with an apology of his own. it was literally like a 'i'm sorry' 'no i'm sorry!' type thing after which we both laughed and patted each other on the back. turns out he came to an agreement with piotr after figuring out what had happened- piotr will stay, on the understanding that if there's one step out of line he's out, and he's not going to take my boss's note any further. the forklift accident will go down as simply an accident. he has since offended another person during the day, but as that is not my fuck up the story will remain untold. thank you all for your kind support- i'll remember the advice when something like this inevitably happens again.",4
"by masturbating with a power washer.. clearly nsfw, but to be safe putting that out there.

this happened about a month ago, and i was tasked with helping my dad power wash our outdoor cement floor. how was i gonna help, since he was gonna be doing the actual washing with the nozzle? i was gonna hold the actual machine part still. normally a power washer has wheels so you can roll it around and keep it in place as you wash away, but ours had its wheel break just a few weeks ago, and my father hadn't gotten around to replacing it. we tried wedging wooden blocks underneath to try to keep it upright but the vibrating from the machine kept hobbling it over and off the support, and that's where i came in. i needed to keep it perfectly balanced while my dad toiled away.


now here is where my mind decided to wander. it had been a while since i'd had a satisfactory toss of the salad, and while my hands always got the job done, i never really experienced what other girls have exclaimed with glowing reviews: vibrators are mystical. you can see where this is going.


while my father was out of sight washing a section of the floor behind a wooden gate, i pressed my crotch up against the metal handle of the unit, and by god i was not ready for how powerful that thing was. such relentless, jarring vibrations... it was almost too much for me to handle.



almost. i powered through, gripping that metal handle with all my might as i let it quite literally rock my body. my legs were starting to shake, my voice quivered and my legs subconsciously began pressing forward as i could feel that surge begin to heighten. i whimpered and bit my lip, my head simply swimming in the moment as i hear



""hey whoa whoa what the fuck!""


i took an immediate step back and looked towards the gate, seeing a massive plume of white smoke brushing over and through it as my dad barged in towards me. his eyes went to the unit, as did mine. there was smoke billowing out from its exhaust in almost frightening amounts. he took the reins and shut the machine off, grabbing it from me and looking it over while he held it. he asked me what i was doing and i meekly replied with i was just holding it forward, keeping it balanced like he asked me.




apparently in my lustful throes, i was pushing the unit forward, so much forward that oil flooded the engine block and it began burning oil and fuel, hence the white smoke. as if on cue while my dad explained this to me, the exhaust port began leaking fluids, almost as much as my exhaust port but i digress. we had to stop the cleaning midwash, while my dad checked to see if i hadn't fucked up the machine. i did, and now we need to buy a new one.



tl;dr i masturbated with a power washer and through my sheer horny stupidity... we are out of a power washer.",4
"for leaving a $0 tip?. i went out for dinner and drinks with some friends last night.  we ordered several rounds, plus appetizers and meals.  other than politely asking for some missing sides with the food we were generally an easy-going table. despite our waitress being unhelpful, slow, and a little rude i was planning on leaving a 15% tip (my usual minimum for poor service).

when i received the check i found out all our drinks were upcharged to top shelf, nearly doubling the cost.  we were never asked about any upcharges, and the menu lists the option for premium drinks as ""optional"" in small text.

when i confronted the waitress politely, showing her the menu with the price options, she coldly responded ""that's just what i do, i always put the premium"" and left before i could ask to see a manager.  there was no apology, no mention of restaurant policy, and no other explantation.  the waitress was quietly upcharging everyone hoping to get tipped the same percentage on a bigger bill.

we left a note on the receipt for the manager, a review on the company website, and a $0 tip for the scammy behavior of the waitress.

"my parents are in severe debt and want me to take out a bank loan for them. is my solution to their problem viable?. my dad was laid off in june 2016 and has struggled to find a stable job since. he and my mom live in a $350k house that they'll never pay off. i've told them until i'm blue in face to sell the house and find a cheaper living option but they refuse to do so.

the last thing i want is a high interest bank loan in my name, but i also don't want my parents to be broke. my solution is for them to sell the house, pay off the mortgage and get back the roughly $70-$80k they have tied up in it, and use that to rent somewhere cheap. that amount could potentially sustain them for years until my dad is old enough to collect social security (he's 61 now). however, i don't know a lot about how mortagages and home ownership work to know if this is a viable plan. any advice is appreciated.

* if this type of behaviour is not in your repertoire **but** you really want to be a better employee, bring this up after your next review or privately that you are looking to change your ways. if it is not sincere don't waste everyone's time in my opinion. 

**edit 2** thanks everyone. this was one of those posts i expected to get buried in a matter of moments. thank you for letting me share my perspective. ",8
