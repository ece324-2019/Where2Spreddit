TIFU by probably getting put on some police list for using wet wipes,"This TIFU actually happened today much to everyone's surprise.

I went fishing early in the morning with my father and we caught some glorious fishies. Anyone who's been fishing knows the smell of bait and fish guts is not very pleasant and is extremely difficult to get the stench out of your hands. I whipped my hand sanitiser out and did the best I could but the smell was still there, but hey that's what fishin' is all about!

On the way home we stopped off at the supermarket to get a few supplies and I opted to wait in the car while my dad got the goods. So I'm just sitting there with smelly hands, bored as hell so I started looking in the car for literally anything to do. I found some wet wipes in the glovebox and immediately thought ""Hey! I can use these to get the smell out of my hands"" so I wiped my hands and looked at my phone and realised I could use this to clean my phone too after handling it while fishing (because seriously, who doesn't take a photo of their catch, please it's 2019 for goodness sake) aaaaaand this is where the fuck up begins.

I took out a wipe, put my phone on my lap and started furiously wiping the screen to get the stickyness off. About 30 seconds go by until I realise there's a middle aged woman standing about 20 feet away from the car staring at me in shock... We made awkward eye contact and I continued to aggressively scrub my phone until she pulled out her phone, dialled a number and walked off looking disgusted.

It was only a few moments later when I realised that from outside of the car it looked like I was furiously masturbating while chilling in my car.

So to the lady who had he great pleasure of witnessing that, sorry if you thought I was jerkin my gherkin in broad daylight, in the middle of a shopping centre carpark and I hope you didn't call the cops on me!

TL;DR cleaning my phone while in a car and it looked like I was jacking off, woman who walked by disgusted probably called the cops.",tifu
good news update! [CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"Mostly good news.

I worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

I got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. What my brother and I inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. My grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. She didn't do the same with mine before she died (I thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when I was old enough to know how to take care of them. There was no trust, she just trusted my dad. My dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. My dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

Dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. My brother found out I still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. That's how my brother found out I still had shares and they'd grown.

According to all that info my lawyer tells me I'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. I say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. The letter I received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

A week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. His girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. I felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures I might have given him some. The next morning I found all my tires had been slashed. Screw him, I don't feel bad any more.

The rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise I don't know nearly enough about what I'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. A lot of the decisions I've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because I knew it would but because I had no idea what I was doing and left it up to him. I've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what I have. Thanks for all your comments.",legaladvice

Skinny wife happy life?,"Since my husband and I had our first child he doesn't want to do anything just the two of us even when our daughter is staying overnight at grandparents house.  If I brought it up he would give me the same story that  we would do something next time we're alone, but every time she was away he didn't feel like going anywhere.  About a year and half ago,  when arguing about him once again not wanting to have a date night alone. He brought up that the reason he never wants to take me out is because he was ashamed to be seen with me because I wasn't the same size I was before I had my daughter. Im 5'8 and was 140-150lbs before I had a  kid and I'm not going to lie I was struggling to lose weight and weighed 180lbs.  That remark cut me deeply. After that he quit wanting sex,  I had a hysterectomy and the thought of no longer being able to have more kids led to depression and  he began insulting me more telling me I was worthless, oink at me, and if he sees me changing clothes he will look at me with an appalled disgusted face and walk out of the room.  when I was awake I would repeatedly tell myself your disgusting, your worthless, my family is embarrassed to be seen with me over and over all day. Sleeping became the only way to stop the intrusive negative thoughts I had, so I slept all day while my daughter was at school. I finally went to the doctor and was prescribed antidepressants but  they made me drowsy so I was still sleeping a lot.  I've gained 50 more pounds in the last year and I cannot get motivated to do anything anymore. I've distanced myself from friends and family, and I hate going anywhere because im embarrassed to make eye contact with people, even with total strangers. My husband told me about one of his coworkers having weight loss surgery and keeps mentioning that i should look into having it done.  He says all of our problems revolve around my weight gain and says I'll have more confidence in myself if I get it done. Has anyone else been in a relationship that went downhill after someone gained weight and seemed to improve with weight loss?

My friends house was stolen [OH],"LOCATION: OHIO

Hello,

I am writing this on behalf of my friend and co-worker who is fully aware I am posting this.  Below is a description of the situation, taken and edited for privacy, from a post he made alerting his friends and family of what has happened.

>My husband and I were recently paid a visit last month by someone claiming to own our home. ""I'm sorry..this is going to sound really crazy and I know you have lived here a long time, but I own this house."" Which just happens to be the home we purchased 8 years ago and where our family have been living and paying our mortgage. I immediately asked him to leave our property and contacted our local police department while he angrily began taking pictures of our house and vehicle in the driveway. To my surprise when I searched our county auditor's web page, there were indeed two transfers made in July of this year. We were never made aware of or signed any transfer of ownership. When I contacted our mortgage company to whom we make payments, they were not aware of any title changes either but they did make it clear that we are still responsible to make all of our mortgage payments.  
>  
>We made a trip to our county records department but no one could answer how our home was seemingly purchased right out from under us and the deeds transferred without us or the mortgage bank being involved. The department head and supervisor at the records department were just as baffled as we were.  The previous owner who sold us the home is deceased and the original lender is no longer in business. We then received legal council and filed a police report last month due to multiple very aggressive attempts to gain access to our home by a man claiming to represent the ""current owners.""  Apparently, our house should never have been sold to us and has recently been sold right out from underneath us. We were advised to submit a title insurance claim and begin preparations to move.  
>  
>We found out that there was a case that involved our house and the ""Detroit Fire and Police Pension property scam"" out of Michigan. That case opened in 2008 and the final judgement was made 4 years later. We purchased our home using a ""Survivorship Warranty Deed"" with what we assumed was a clean title, but we were wrong.   We have requested that the corporation evict our family and not return to our home again.  Fortunately, no one has returned since.  We were alarmed when the supposed ""new owners"" received their first piece of mail at our residence which happened to be a water bill. They have made yet another transfer WITHOUT NOTICE.  I got in contact with the water company only to get an apologetic, ""I am sorry Mrs. #####., Only the owners can change it back and we can not give you any balance or account information.""

While they have sought legal counsel, they are desperately seeking any additional information they can get regarding this situation.  Everyone they speak with seems baffled by what has happened.   I will run all questions through him before responding for complete accuracy.",legaladvice
A poor Irish family lives on a farm...,"A poor Irish family lives on a farm and they rely on their single cow for income.

TIFU by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp,"Technically yesterday and not today, but YIFU sounds like some odd anime genre so...

So it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. I was dropping her off at about 8ish and I was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. For the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

Anyway, stopped at the summer camp. My daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. I signed my daughter in and then I.... just drove off. In my defense, well, I got nothing. Honestly, I just forgot the dog there.

So my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. Apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. I now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). She also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. She got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. All in all, could have gone worse.

Edit - I get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  Sorry, but no can do.  Pics include other people's kids and I'm not going to post that.  Also, I think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and I've said way too much shit I regret on Reddit for that to happen.  Just use your imaginations.  She's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  Muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  She's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

Edit 2 - For those asking.  Yes, camp called me.  Twice.  And left VM's both times.  Number was not one I recognized so I didn't pick up or check VM (I know, TIFU!  Number is now programmed in).  Both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if I could come pick the dog up.  I clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  And yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  Huge HUGE props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

Edit 3 - For those asking.  I did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  So I left them an awesome review on Yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

Edit 4 - Yah, I get it.  This could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  Yes, it was a mistake on my side.  That's why I'm posting it here and not on r/todayIwasawesome

Edit 5 - Holy crap.  Came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  I just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

TL;DR - Dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. Dog had a great time and I think she's now a camp counselor.",tifu

TIFU by taking LSD and pretending to be French for 10 months,"Throwaway for reasons.
TL;DR at the bottom.

So this was more of a FU that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

About 11 months ago I moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until I could get the money together to sort something out properly, I was hoping to have already moved out by this point. On my second day after I'd finished unpacking I decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, I'd brought some with me that I'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

Things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and I quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than I had been told they were, and I thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. So I figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because I was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

So I left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. It's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. I'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. She said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

So basically I do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where I pretend I can't speak English. I remember a few words from my GCSE French so I just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. In the state I was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and French just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. My exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and I shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. She pretty much just left me to it after that and I got on my way. I did my walk and got home about two hours later, I was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. When I got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. I tried to keep my head down because I couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so I instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. When I got in I started freaking out straight away because I realised that I'd just become French and now two of the neighbours think I can't speak any English. The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be French for seemingly no reason. 

Fast forward 10 months, I still live here, and at this point I'm in DEEP. My life on this street is a web of lies. I've perfected my French accent and over the course of 10 months French Me has learnt a decent amount of English so he can hold disjointed conversation.
I'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and I was the nice quirky French guy on the street. I didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation I had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered I wasn't French. If I had friends come over (I don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. Most of them found it amusing, at least. 

Things were going okay and I wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because I'd gotten so used to it. I'm not home that much and when I am I rarely leave the house for any reason so I only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when I was out on my street. If anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when I got to take on my French persona. French Me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his English was a bit limited.

But then there was the day it all came crashing down. I was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her I didn't recognise. She stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy I was telling you about"". You might be able to see where this is going. 

Her friend hits me with a question in French that I didn't understand a word of, and I knew he was actually French straight away because his accent was way better than mine. I didn't know what to do and I just froze. Every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause I just decided I had to come clean. I told her I wasn't actually French and couldn't speak French and then I tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke I'd been doing on everyone. Nobody was buying that. I fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

I haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which I'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. I make sure nobody is around now whenever I leave the house, and I do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when I get home so that I never come into contact with them. Every time I think about the day I was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

TL;DR: Pretended to be French to avoid human interaction on LSD, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a French man.

EDIT: I didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and I'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. Some people seem to have a hard time believing that I thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, I'd like to remind people that when I made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",tifu
Update: charged $1700 for lab work that insurance denied as medically unnecessary. Fixed!,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az3yna/doctor_sent_me_to_get_bloodwork_at_an_innetwork/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Edit: this is in California

I just wanted to start of by saying thank you to everyone who commented and gave advice! I really appreciate all the help. 

Here's what I ended up doing:

I called my own insurance company to find out why it was denied. I found out that, because of my dad's specific insurance plan, I was supposed to go to a specific doctor's office and lab for my yearly checkup and bloodwork that is near my parent's house because the insurance has a specific contract with them. I didn't go there because I live a few hundred miles away. However, my address is listed as my parent's address so the insurance company thought I lived nearby. They said I could appeal with an address change but the woman on the phone was very upfront and said that those never get approved. She said that, if I could get my doctor to change the billing code (just like all of you said!! You noble wonderful people) then the insurance company would review it. She also said that the old code had to be removed and a new one put in place. The new billing couldn't have both codes on it. 

So! I went to my doctors office and brought in my bill. The admin at the front was so sympathetic and understanding and promised to take care of it within the next few days. I told her everything hat the insurance lady told me, and she wrote it all down and clipped it to a copy of my bill. She said that the diagnostics place never even sent them my results! By that Friday, she had gotten my results and had me come in to find what they were, resubmitted he claim to insurance, and put a hold on all payments until it was figured out. 

Today, I got my new bill in the mail. All of the bloodwork was covered. My new bill is $0.00.  I cried all over the place, you guys. 

I'm planning on bringing that admin a thank-you card and maybe a Starbucks card and flowers. Hopefully she's allowed to take them. 

Thank you all SO much for all of your advice and help. You are all the best!! You literally helped me from having to pay 10% of my yearly wages! Plus, I started saving up in preparation for having to pay this bill so now I have the beginnings of a little nest egg/emergency fund just in case something happens in the future. Again, you guys rock. ",legaladvice

I've been with my boyfriend for 7 months and he's small down there, like 4 inches give or take.

 However the last few days he got increasingly agitated and kept asking me if I was lying, if he's too small, and wouldn't take ""You're fine"" or ""You're average"" or ""I don't care how big it is"" for an answer. I told him to stop pestering me but this went on for a few more days until I snapped and told him he's below average but he has nothing to worry about. Obviously he didn't take it well.

WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

We've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not YOUR pan. 

She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn't want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that I'm not to touch them unless I'm cooking vegan. 

That wasn't good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don't mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly I'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick.

My wife is laying in the bed with my son on top of her, and I've just been sitting in one of the chairs. As people kept coming in, I noticed some rather odd looks from them, some mumbling, and some more odd looks. I figured I had some food on my face or something and didn't think too much of it.

Suddenly, I'm sitting there reading something on reddit when my wife looks at me and says, ""What's that between your legs?""

I look down, and there's a pink ball between my legs. Confusion quickly turns to shock as I realize that pink ball is one of *my* balls. One of my testicles is literally hanging out of my pants and is sitting on the seat.

I don't have a spare pair of pants here, so now I'm just sitting with my legs tightly together like I'm wearing a skirt and praying my son doesn't stay here long.

TL;DR I found out I had a hole in my pants by multiple people noticing a testicle sitting on my chair.

**EDIT: Most common question is about my undergarments. I was indeed wearing boxers. My testicle came out the bottom of them.**

EDIT2: Wow this post really got the ball rolling (what, I can't do testy puns too?). Thank you kind stranger for the coconut reward! I had no idea such an appropriate award existed for this situation.

**EDIT3: I GOT PANTS! As several people suggested, I explained my predicament to the nurse, and she hooked me up with a pair of scrub pants. They'll make excellent pajama pants.**

And thank you for another coconut! I have two now! How fitting. Thank you, kind stranger.

EDIT4: Another coconut (three nuts now—one can fall out, and I still have two left) and a silver. Thank you again!

EDIT5: Popped my gold cherry. Guess everything is popping for me today. Thank you, internet stranger!

**EDIT6: Dammit! Replacement pants are actually worse than original pants. [Here's me wearing them on top of my pants](https://imgur.com/a/xI6y80B). The ""fly"" makes no sense. Wife confirms it.**

EDIT7: Thank you to /u/jedberg for evening out my balls at two pairs and another kind stranger for more silver!

**LAST EVER EDIT: Son is doing better. We can hopefully leave tomorrow. My ball has been staying put in two sets of pants. Thank you for all the love and support everyone. Sorry for going a little (lot) edit crazy. Just overwhelmed by all the support.**",tifu
TIFU by going down on my wife,"One of my favorite things to do is go down on my wife. I have a talented tongue and I like to use it. Last night I decided to make that experience even more mind-blowing for my wife by grabbing the dildo and fucking her with it at the same time. Fun times were being had by all and things were getting very hot and very wet. Then my wife started to orgasm and my hand slipped and the dildo shot out of her vagina and directly into my right eye. I pulled away and she asked what was wrong. Not wanting to stop there I told her not to worry about it and I would tell her after. We finish and I go to the bathroom to rinse my face (and eye) and tell her what happened. We both are laughing hard at this but I tell her jokingly ""your vagina just gave me pink eye!""

Well, today my eye was red, itchy, burning, and gross. I just left urgent care with drops for pink eye. My doctor thought it was hilarious and burned my ass on the way out saying ""now go to the pharmacy for your vagina drops!""

I always thought my first lesbian sex injury would be a broken finger.

TL;DR - While going down my wife the dildo popped out of her vagina and hit in the eye resulting in pink eye.

Husband (33M) cheated on me (32F) with my sister in law (29F),"We went on vacation with my brother and his wife. They're newly married but I always got along with her and I thought she was so nice. She and my husband were very friendly but my husband is really talkative and they work in the same field and they were sweet with each other so I thought it was more of a little sister-older brother relationship.

We went on a trip together and all four of us were at the bar, talking and everything. I was tired and we had a long day so I went upstairs to our room. I woke up a few hours later around 3 am and I texted him but he still wasn't back, so I went downstairs to tell him to come to bed. Well, my brother wasn't there but I saw him and her kissing. And it wasn't like a drunken kiss, they looked pretty fucking comfortable and I know that wasn't the first time

I went back to bed and didn't mention it to him. He is acting especially sweet and I hate him and that bitch ",relationship_advice
(Update) The exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order,"You all thought it over.  So did I.  But no!  Turns out this story really could get weirder

Recap- years ago I took in an injured stray cat.  The cat was did not have a collar or chip.  A good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. After owning the cat for several years I began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  They demanded I return the cat and I refused and blocked them.  Eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  The letters demanded I pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  At this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

Someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. I ignored the first two but when they kept arriving I went ahead and did so.  I assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter I received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  This was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

So, to cut this already way too long story short, I filed a police report.  After some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  Okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

I will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but I'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  This is honestly the single dumbest thing I've ever gone through.

My cat continues not to care.

AITA for cussing out my in-laws for going through my luggage?,"I recently got engaged and took some time off to visit our parents and start planning. First stop was mine and then his.

I suffer from chronic pain and take a variety of meds which cause a decrease in appetite and nausea. I haven't disclosed my illness to my in-laws, but a few nights ago I could hear her complaining about how I'm too good to eat what they cook. I let it go.

Yesterday, fiancé took me around his hometown. On the way back, he remembered to get beer, but we were already pulling into the driveway. I was tired, so he dropped me off. His parents were waiting for me in the living room, angry.

Future mother-in-law - FMIL: You really think you can pull the wool over our eyes, don't you? You think you can bring drugs into our house?!

Me: *motioning to a seat because my legs hurt*

FMIL: No no! You stand! How dare you bring this disgusting bullshit into our house!

I reach for my cellphone and she yells at me to keep my hands at my side.

FMIL: I don't care how legal this stuff is. We don't allow this garbage in our house! *She pulls out a plastic wrapped package and I immediately know what it is.* My husband took a bite out of it and got sick! 

I'm pissed off right now because this was at the bottom of my luggage! And then she starts going off about how many pills I take (again, wouldn't know if you hadn't gone through my stuff) and how her son doesn't deserve a druggie. She takes my package and shows me where FFIL took a few bites and threw up soon after.

It's been 10 minutes and my fiancé is back. His mom asks him if he knows all the medication I'm on and how I brought pot into their house. He can't get a straight answer about how they know about my medicine, but then he glances at the package and just sighs.

Fiancé: Mom, it's soap. Even says African Black Soap.

He broke off a piece, headed to the kitchen, and washed his hands with it, showing them the lather. FMIL fired back saying that she's never seen soap like that and that this doesn't explain the amount of meds I take. They say they're justified in what they did because they want the best for their son and since it's their house they can go through personal belongings at will.

I let them have it. I start screaming and cussing because I'm exhausted and tired. I can't remember everything I said, but my throat has been a mess from all of the screaming. FFIL tried to give me back the soap, but I kind of threw it at him saying I didn't want his gum disease. Terrible, I know.

We're staying at a hotel and not talking to his parents. I feel I could have gone about it better. I wanted a good relationship with my in-laws and we've always kind of gotten along... now I feel like I fucked up badly.

**TL;DR: future in-laws went through my luggage and mistook soap for an edible. I cussed them out and offended them and now I feel like I burned a major bridge.**

"I'm Indian. Apu is not even a little bit offensive. On the contrary, he's one of the best POC representations for its era.","The Simpsons debuted in 1989, when the population was way more white, and the only really existent minority was black (and maybe Hispanic).  Indians basically didn't exist in the US.  

Typically when making roles based on uninfluential minorities, it's considered okay to make them very negative.  This is why Asian characters were shitty roles, while Black characters weren't; Blacks made up 12% of the population, while Asians were not even 1%.  White characters were never made fun of for their whiteness, because whites were 80%+ of the populace.  

Taking this into context, it's actually commendable how great of a character Apu was written to be.  

Now the bad part:  His accent was *absolute white trash levels of horrible*, and makes me cringe listening to it.  I definitely agree that he should have been voiced by someone who could actually do a fucking Indian accent.  But again, given the time this was created in, even this isn't that big of an issue.  

I don't care who the voice actor is, because voice actors routinely voice all sorts of different races.  I've seen lots of Black voice actors voicing whites, it's not a big deal.  I'd only care that they could actually get the accent to be sort of accurate.  That would *probably* necessitate the actor being Indian though.  

For comparison, let's look at Raj, from the Big Bang Theory, which aired in 2007.  BBT pushes all sorts of stereotypes that don't even fucking make sense to me, like effeminacy and obliviousness, and these are *bad* stereotypes to boot.  And that's something that was created just 10 years ago.  Not to mention that BBT is a completely shit show aside from all of that.  

My final take:  People crying about Apu are crybabies who don't know how to think for themselves, and I don't think it's a coincidence that most of the Indian people I know aren't even fazed by him.  I will agree that his accent was trash and grossly inaccurate, and his voice actor should have been replaced a long time ago.  Apart from that, the character himself was totally fine.

AITA for being mad at my parents for ignoring safety tips I told them about visiting my area?,"
My parents are pretty well off, they live in a suburban area where it's pretty expected to ""keep up with the Joneses"" and show off with nice cars, spending a lot on a house and on entertaining, designer clothes, etc. But they don't have a lot of savings and that stresses me out.

Anyway, I am kind of the opposite. I'm living in an area that's kind of rough right now, driving an old truck, but it's close to my work and it's close to my friends places. I'm saving a lot doing all this. I've paid off my student loans already and I'm saving for a house.

My parents wanted to come visit the city I'm living in, and I said I'd host them at my apartment. But I said to leave the luxury cars behind and take the older sedan that they'd been using as a driving-instruction car for me and my siblings. And I told them to not leave any valuables in the car, instead bring their things inside my apartment. And also, don't bring a large purse or backpack and don't talk to strangers who approach you because they might try and pickpocket you. 

So my parents showed up in their 2018 porche and my mom steps out with a huge designer handbag that doesn't close except for a small snap closure on top. And I'm frustrated they didn't listen but I tell them to come inside, being their things in, and I lend my mom a smaller handbag of mine.

We went out for dinner and when we come back, their car's been broken into. And my dad is freaking out because a bag of his things was stolen. I was frustrated because I'd said to not bring a flashy car and to not leave things in the car... But we go file a police report and that takes up most of the night.

I got snappy at my parents that night for not listening to one of the things I'd said; bringing their flashiest car when I'd said that was a bad idea, etc.

And they got mad at me for having said that they probably won't see their stuff again.

AITA for not giving up our table to an autistic kid?,"Okay so a few days ago i went to a nice cafe with my friend. We decided to sit in a corner that was close enough to the bar. We didn't even took our jacket off yet and a young teenager (13 or something?) came towards us. 

""I always sit there.""
-""Oh well... it won't bother you if you sat somewhere else wouldn't it?""

The kid suddenly starts screaming for his mother and she came ASAP. The kid told her in tears that we 'stole' his favorite place and pushed him away while doing so (we didn't even touched him). His mother comforted him and told us with a painfully forced smile that they always sat there since he was a baby and that it was 'their special spot'. I politely told her that i wasn't planning on moving since we had this table first. The kid starts screaming, letting himself fall on the floor while his mother started to yell at us for being 'rude and unreasonable people' and that her son is autistic and doesn't likes changes. People were now looking at us and quickly the manager came. They clearly knew each other and the mother started to say that they were loyal customers, coming every 2 Friday nights since the birth of her son and that she wouldn't be throwing a fit if the manager didn't just banned all those rude young people. 

The dad just stood there and glared a bit at us but that's it. After a couple of minutes they left while pulling the kid out of the place. 

My friend told me that we just had to move to another table to avoid such thing since autistic kids/people will get frustrated if things don't go their way.

AITA for changing my wife's clothing sizes without telling her?,"My wife has gained some weight over the last year, and keeps beating herself up over it. She's always sadly talking about her sizes and calling herself too big. She lost her excitement with shopping and a few months ago I guess I made a step to change that.

She's always asking me to get things for her while she's in the dressing room, new sizes etc. She told me to get a pair of jean shorts for her in a size 6 (this size is too small for her now by a lot. She's kind of in denial about this and always asks for a size 6 and then gets very upset when it won't fit at all. She's more of a size 10 or 12 now. )

I don't know... I got a bigger size and changed the sticker on the jeans so it said size 6. When it fit she was so happy and kept showing me and saying she's so proud. She said she must have lost weight but doesn't know what she did. She bought them feeling very confident with herself. When we got home, I cut the tag off the shorts. 

I didn't mean to but a few times after that I did it again. I guess it was part wanting to see my wife happy and part not knowing how to deal with the same meltdown happening every time. She looks really beautiful even if she gained some weight. I kept doing this and only recently did she realize that the tags on her clothes are missing. She asked me about it and I said I didn't know, maybe the store doesn't use them, but she googled the store and proved they did.

[CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"When my brother was 16 and I was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. As soon as we were old enough it was transfered into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda.

I knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since I understood what it was. By the time I was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in apple, and I'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because Dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until I'm forty something.

I don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and I didn't really grow up with him so all I usually hear about his life comes through dad. His new girlfriend works in law though, and I've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15000. The number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. They want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if I don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and I'd be left with nothing.

The dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. If half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. I know it sounds selfish but I'm really used to having the extra income back me up when I've wanted to move. I've lived in four states by my own choice and I want to move and take in more before I settle down, if I ever do.

How likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? As far as I know there was no paperwork or will just my grandmother's word. She set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transfered the whole lot to me six years ago.

AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?,"My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. 

When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I'm living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I'm grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her.

TIFU by buying a used PlayStation 2 on Letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.,"This happened only minutes ago.


The graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


At the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


Now, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?


Starting to sound like a mistake yet?


If the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2's from later in the console's production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.


My first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.


Back at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I'm off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn't read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.


Now I'm starting to get slightly pissed. I'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


I open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I've now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.


Oh golly gee fuck was I wrong.


Now at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It's putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I'm sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


I experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


You see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.


Oh, that's not all rust.


*Ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


Do you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, ""Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they're crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


They're getting everywhere now. I'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


At least, I *hope* I finished the job. I'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I'm a little too emotionally drained to care. I also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that I *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. Jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and I already need a stiff drink.


TL;DR: I bought a used PS2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

"TIFU by telling the grocery store they needed to get rid of their new, loud, automated door greeter.","This happened last week. I was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. I pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and I hear in an automated, LOUD, voice, ""THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT SAFEWAY!""  
Slightly startled by the unexpected greeting, I continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. Multiple times I hear, ""WELCOME TO SAFEWAY!"" And ""THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING YOUR LOCAL SAFEWAY."" And I think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.  
  
  After I pickup my script, I grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the U-Scan to check out and I am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. After I finish at U-Scan and turn to leave I see a manager speaking to the U-Scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, ""You guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. That THING is SOOOOOO annoying!""    
The manager looks at me like I'm A FUCKING MONSTER and says, ""There is NO WAY we are getting rid of Sarah! She isn't going ANYWHERE!""       
  
Confused and surprised I bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she's crazy and go to leave, running the confusion through my head, looking down as I walk. Then I go to exit and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and I look up. Turns out the robo-greeter Sarah is a human woman named Sarah with ALS or some kind of similar Hawking-esque catastrophic disability. She was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messages for customers as they enter and exit.   My stomach immediately SANK and my face turned red as I walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...

TL;DR I told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman.   
  
EDIT - Just to clarify, I think this is HYSTERICAL now. I find great hilarity at my own blunder, which is why I decided to share. I'm not going to a different store. I have no shame in going back there at all.

Tl;Dr I'm free

I really want to thank each one of you who commented on my previous post. This wasn't a decision I took lightly and it took a great deal of swallowing my pride. 

I would like to say I dumped him as soon as I read everyone's comment about him being abusive. Unfortunately it took me a bit longer to come to my senses. The following things happened after my post...

I tried to talk to him about being unhappy and saying he needs to leave. He told me to shut up and leave him alone. I told him I'm not leaving until we finish talking. He started to do the dishes and he said if I didn't shut up he was going to start to break a dish for every word I said. I didn't stop talking. He threw a bowl at my feet and I stepped in glass. He started profusely apologizing after he realized my foot was bleeding. He telling me he loves me. I stupidly forgave him.

Later he called my work screaming at me to get the fuck home. I kept asking why? He told me get the fuck home now or I'm going to kill myself. I start crying and freaking out because he has the kids and I hear the baby crying. I start asking is the baby ok? He says shut up and get the fuck home. Hangs up. I panic and leave work right away. I try calling him the whole drive home (20minutes). I'm panicking thinking my children are in danger. I come home and it turns out the baby pooped in his diaper and things got a little messy when trying to change him.. I was like are you serious? I told him I understand he was stressed out but he can never call me like that at work ever again. He called me selfish and a cunt.

When I realized in that moment I feared him hurting my baby.. I knew this had to end. Regardless of how much I thought I loved him. If his mom stopped watching the kids.. I'd figure it out but I couldn't do this my whole life. I was exhausted physically and emotionally. I didn't care if I was alone forever because no one wants a single mom of 2 kids.. I just wanted to live in peace. 

So the day I did it. I couldn't talk to him in person because he would twist my words around and I did not want to be subjected to more violence. I wrote him a letter. I wrote down everything I could think of. I recalled every memory of him that has scarred me over the last 8 years. I told him I already do this alone it's time for me to actually be alone. With the letter was my ring he gave me. I told him don't fight this. You can contact me but only to see the kids. I had packed a bag and went to my parents. I told him I would gather the rest of things in a few weeks.

It's been hard. I wake up in panic thinking what have I done but then I come to my senses and realize how calm I feel. I don't feel like I'm walking on egg shells anymore. I don't even care if he's right and no one else wants me. I'm happy again. Thank you reddit. I don't think I would've finally gotten the courage with you guys. 

Edit: wow I did not expect this response. Thank you so much for the support. I just wanted to clear up some things.
I will not be going over alone. I originally planned on bringing my dad but I did not know about the police escort. I will definitely have to look into that.
I will not let him have his children alone. I will drop them off at his parents house for him to visit with them.
I didn't realize when I posted my original post that these were abusive tendencies. I thought because he wasn't physically abusive it didn't count. Once people started telling me that wasn't the case I realized this had been going on for over 5 years. He punched holes in all our houses. Have thrown several dishes. Screamed at the top of his lungs at me. Once called me at work because he locked himself out of the house while I was at work. I told him he could either go to his moms for 2 hours or wait for me. He started spamming hate texts saying fuck you bitch, cunt, whore, etc. when I ignored his texts he started calling the phones at work saying the same things. 

Lastly people are saying why I had kids with him or why I couldn't see how bad this was. Well because I was with him since I was 15. From 15-20 it was great. He was my first love. First everything. I had nothing else to compare it to when the anger started. I thought every relationship had its issues and these were mine. He told me I was the crazy one when I would say something. I love my kids and never regret bringing them into the world. They gave me a purpose.

Thanks again..",relationship_advice

I'm a female born without a vagina. How do I tell a guy that I'm interested in about it?,"I'm not too sure where to post this but the MRKH subreddit is very dead, so I guess I'll give this a shot??

I have MRKH syndrome. Basically meaning I was born with without a vagina, vaginal canal, cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes. This makes me unable to have sex, and unable to have children.
 
I met a guy on a dating app about a week ago and we've been texting since. I've been super busy with school, volunteer work, and meetings, so we haven't actually met in person yet. We spoke on the phone once so far while he was walking home from work at 3am (he's a bartender). He's really funny, and I feel like he gets me. We've set up a coffee date for Wednesday and I'm really looking forward to it. 

So far, he's definitely shown interest in me, saying things like how hes been crushing on me or how he thinks I'm really sweet and lovely. I don't want to get ahead of myself but I feel the same way back. This is the first time I've ever connected with someone this way on a dating app! 

I'm excited but at the same time I'm also VERY nervous. He's very honest and blunt about things and I feel that I need to reciprocate that. A lot of doctors and therapists say that there's no 'right time' to discuss it, only when you feel comfortable. Although that's true, I dont want either of us to be invested in the other before having the chance to talk about it. So I guess my question is how long should I wait before telling him? Would it be too much if I told him on our first date? I mean, for all I know maybe he won't even be interested in me after meet in person. But at the same time if he is, I'm not trying to scare him away...

And a follow up question, how do I begin to tell him?? Maybe a funny way to approach it? Or a good conversation starter that could lead the conversation towards my condition? I've told one guy before and that didn't go to well. I waited a month to tell him and I ended up crying while doing it. He was interested in me before I told him but afterwards, he was only interested in being FWB. My self-esteem definitely took a kick with that one. 

Any advice would be good really. Thanks.

On the day of het birthday I asked her to wait for me after work so I can take her somewhere but she said no and not to worry about it. I wanted to do SOMETHING so I went to her favorite restaurant and got her favorite meal for dinner and I bought her a Kindle as an early birthday present. We had a nice night but eventually she basically said while she appreciated everything I did, she wished I did something more meaningful. I felt pretty bad and seeing my hurt upset her and she went to bed really early last night. 

This morning she told me I should have known better and that she would have went out if I set something up. I was upset and called her childish for not being straightforward expecting me to be a mind reader. Maybe I was wrong for saying those things but I was upset. Now I feel bad.

His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over.

The gays taking the rainbow to represent their movement was a dick move,"I'll preface this by saying I'm completely supportive of the gays. 

—

The rainbow should belong to everyone. It represents color and art. It represents a beautiful and near-magical natural phenomenon. 

It was a dick move to take a symbol that had meaning to everyone and limit it to representing who you'd rather fuck or date. 

People used to display the rainbow freely because it's a beautiful thing— on clothes, on designs; I even remember an airplane company with a rainbow tail. Now whenever it's displayed, it's associated with a political movement. 

Also, they kinda stereotyped themselves with a flag that represents an embrace of flamboyance. Not every gay is flamboyant, only the most outspoken ones that dominate the face of the community.

TIFU by taking amphetamines and subsequently masturbating my limp penis for 6 hours. [NSFW],"Brief summary:

I was recently prescribed an amphetamine medication. I took some and expected the typical described results. What I did not expect was to experience a sharply increased sex drive coupled with an unfortunate effect of impotence - however this would not deter me from my goal of achieving sweet release. I was on a mission to give my brain what it wanted, apparently at any cost, and my rocksteady mental fortitude was nothing short of a fully loaded freight train without brakes.  

Ten minutes of sweet loving turned into half an hour in the blink of an eye. Confused, yet dedicated, I proceeded onward. The next glance at the clock revealed that three hours had gone by. ""How could this be happening?"", I thought, but I was far too invested at this point to give up. The next three hours went by as quickly and autonomously as the last, but after a total of six hours, the deed was done, and the ensuing moment of clarity was a grim moment indeed as I considered the consequences of my actions.  

My little man has receded mostly into my body and is now simply a swollen nub which stands stoutly as a monument to man's arrogance. Also, the entire member feels harshly chafed and my entire pelvic region is sore. I'm not looking forward to the next 24 hours.

"After I cracked the door, police pushed it open on me (VA, USA) UPDATE","[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b5q6ha/after_i_cracked_the_door_police_pushed_it_open_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app](Original Post)

Background before yesterday's post:

So, December 2018, I had a fall and fractured my wrist.  It turns out, when police forced in the door on me, combined with cuffing me, he refractured my wrist.  I've attached a report from 3/26, the day, the incident occurred.

So, to summarize:

1) I cracked the door open about 2 inches.

2) 2 police officers, with no paperwork in hand, when I asked ""what are the warrants for?""said they'd have to go check.

3) arrived at my door stating I ""may have outstanding warrants.""

4) I told them 3 times, In a runaround conversation,   me: ""what are the warrants for?"",  and they ""we don't know"" and me: ""I will call the police station and if I have warrants out I'll turn myself in"", and they: ""no ma'am you need to come with us.""

4) Upon my fourth request for the warrants and statement I'd turn myself in, an officer pushed the door open on my body by force, with my right hand on the door.

5) that same officer, agitated, then cuffed me by force, although I didn't resist.

6)! During this time, my right wrist was refractured.

7) During this time I was a female in under pants and t shirt, which I had already mentioned to them repeatedly.

8)  I stated I had some warrants three weeks ago but did not mention that I added already been arraigned on the charges (meaning quite a bit of time for the paperwork to update passed I had been arraigned a full week earlier).

9) The officer who forced the door asked for my SSN.  After some calm questions I provided it.

10) After radioing in my info, I was  uncuffed, as it was discovered I had turned myself in 3 weeks before for these warrants.  The officer apologized ""it had to go this way.""  I indicated that I've been researching my rights as a citizen and I had no idea they could burst in that way.

11) the officers left with polite pleasantries.  

12) shortly after the adrenaline wore off, I noticed the pain in my wrist.  

13) later that say I went to a local medexpress and found my wrist had been refractured.

So, with no warrant and ultimately asking for nothing more than my SSN, officers broke my wrist forcing my door in on me with not a stitch of paperwork allowing them to do so.

I'm beyond angry.  I cannot believe that these cops could behave so egregiously they not only completely ignored the 4th amendment but they basically started me completely over on the healing of my wrist.

If anyone has comments, I guess i should maybe share on r/bola or r/legaladviceofftopic?  Not sure which.

The TLDR of it is my SO and I hid Easter eggs for each other, and the day before I spotted the giant egg. It was the night before Easter, and I wanted to make a light hearted post inquiring about whether or not I should tell him I spotted it. Well, it blew up. Some weren't happy that it wasn't an unhappy post, but many wanted an update. 

Easter wasn't a proposal... But he proposed late last night!! I got home from a long 8 hour drive. He sat me on the couch and wanted to show me a music video he ""helped a friend make"". It was silly, but it was his cover of ""when words fail"" from *the Shrek musical*. It's his favorite musical of all time, and when the relationship was first getting started, I learned one of the duets to surprise him with. It's very cute that he picked the musical, because the song does fit, he's funny, and we're immature together like that. As the video ended, he suddenly got up and sang the rest to me and pulled the ring out of his pocket. 

He made [the ring](http://imgur.com/a/2M5l1Gx) himself with a fire opal, and while it isn't from some fancy big name store, I told him from the very beginning that I don't care how much he spends or doesn't spend. He's not a master jeweler, it was his first (and probably only) ring he will ever make, but it's perfect in every way to me. It symbolizes our love, because he worked so hard on it and it's so very *him*. I love the ring. I love him. I'm nervous to get married because I'm awkward when I'm the center of attention, but I can't wait to be his wife. 

So of course, I accepted! He caught the entire thing on video, but I haven't decided if I want to doxx myself by sharing it here.  I'm also not sure if the mods will allow that? 

So, there it is! The final update! Thank you all for the love and positivity 3 months ago, I hope we can keep all that kindness going for everyone here in the sub!",relationship_advice
Am I shallow for wanting a guy with a decent job?,"Nowadays it seems like most of the men I meet aren't doing much with their lives. They seem to not want to go to school which is fine, but don't want to ""work for someone"" either. They want to own their own businesses but they don't seem to want to put in the work. My last boyfriend went to school but never finished and ended up working in the mall. The guy I met at the grocery store was an up and coming rapper, but we're both 29 and I think it's time for him to be more realistic. Yesterday I went on a date with this guy my friend set me up with and he works at Walmart. I asked him what his goals were and he said he's living in the moment. I asked him if he wanted to work at Walmart forever and he got offended and told me if I'm a gold digger then I came to the wrong place. My friend heard of this and said I'm too picky. I don't want someone swimming in money, I just want you to not live paycheck to paycheck. It feels like women are more successful than men these days and we seem to work harder. Am I honestly being too picky or what? Would you guys be ok with dating a person that was ok with living the struggle life when they didn't have to?",relationship_advice
AITA for wanting a divorce from husband who lost 200k on bitcoin?,"&#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for 10 years. For our entire relationship, I have brought the majority of the money into the home. I contribute 75% of that. I don't mind, really. It's not something I think about and I have always considered it ""our"" money. Our country (Switzerland) is really expensive and I grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. When I had the chance to go to university, I studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. Years later, I make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.

We decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. I would check on the accounts every once in a while but, I haven't been checking regularly. A few weeks ago, I was thinking about buying a Model 3, since it has recently come to our country and I've fancied it for some time. I played with the numbers and while figuring out if I can afford it or not, I realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. There was 300k CHF/USD missing.

When my husband got home, I showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. This is about 25% of our savings. Besides being shocked and angry, I cannot help to feel that he stole from me. He put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. I was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. They think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. But I honestly just want to get divorced. If he is capable of doing this, how can I trust him ever again? AITA for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? AITA for thinking about divorce?

&#x200B;

Edit: To clear a few things. We always talked about where the money should go. What things to invest in, etc. I always thought he was really open about it and I trusted him... because he is my husband. I work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as I do. After going to work every day, making more decisions about money when I came home wasn't something I wanted to do. That's why I wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. Also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. I don't think that was clear above. So we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.

Edit: If he had doubled our money or ""won"" in some way, would I be feeling the same way? Partially. I would be angry for him not talking about this with me. This is a large sum, too large not to discuss. I would be happy because I would have more money. Who wouldn't be happy if they had more money in their home accounts? But I would have stepped in and taken control of everything because I see all of this as gambling and that's not what I would like to do with money.",AmItheAsshole
"2nd and last update, I'm ready to try and put this behind me. I'm the guy that found out my wife did some very racy, almost softcore porn photoshoots and hid it from me for six weeks. Thank you very much for keeping me sane over the past 5 days.","edit: original here:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wo5es/wife_30f_did_a_very_sexy_boudoir_shoot_as_a_favor/

fist update here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wzghr/updateif_allowed_i_posted_about_my_wife_doing_a/


First of all let me say that I really, really appreciate  everyone helping me out. I honestly don't know what I would have done had I not had a place to vent, argue the facts and bounce things off of. When the ""other"" sub removed my post and banned me for just asking why, I really thought I was going to lose my mind because my thoughts were racing a million miles a minute. A very, very sincere thank you. 

So if you recall from one of my updates, Nicky (wife) agreed that we would sit down with Gina (photographer) today and get her full side of the story. I spoke with her yesterday but that was only long enough for her to open the building, get her computer booted up and then get on the road for her shoot. 


I told my wife that I would like to talk to Gina alone at first and she said she had no problems with that. So Gina was very affable and friendly when we sat down at her desk. I asked her if she understood why I was having such a hard time with this. Gina basically said that she did and she was very, very sorry for the way things shook out. I asked her whats her version of ""shook out."" It more or less matched Nicki's version in that she had mentioned Nic shooting with the guy about a week prior to the boudoir shoot, Nic had said absolutely not. When the shoot day came they had an absolutely great time, Nicki suggested they do full nudes in what would be a Christmas present for me and Gina said Nicki was even more relaxed naked so she reintroduced the idea of shooting with her friend Craig (HotAbs McCool) Nicki said what the hell, lets do it. HotAbs McCool was in class, they drank wine while waiting for him and all were good and buzzed by the time he showed up. He brought his girlfriend who Gina has shot for some sort of collegiate volleyball all star thing and everyone was fast friends. Gina had the idea of making it like a visual romance novel where the hot business woman would succumb to HotAbs McCool's advances (mission accomplished). She said Nicki went from having a great time to being super nervous and Gina said she had to really press to get her to open up (pun intended? probably not...but I noticed the phrasing). But Nicki did very well so that's that. I asked her to promise me that there's no other pics, Gina said absolutely not that you can even look in the meta data if needed to see that everything is in a nice complete sequence that lasted about an hour. 

I asked Gina why Nicki, that if this guys girlfriend already knew how to do this, why not just use her (remember, GF did the same poses as Nic did while Nic was taking a break). Gina said she just loved shooting with Nicki and as a photographer, a series of sexy shots where the couple is ""mis-matched"" is much more interesting than just two good looking college kids. 


So that all seemed on the up and up (I mean it wasn't new news, I had heard that all before). Gina promised me that she wasn't going to do anything with the pictures and that it really was just a fun session with friends. I don't know what I was thinking but I asked if I could have a hard drive of all the pictures and Gina said that usually she would never do that, but because we had been friends for so long and the situation was so unique that I could. I have no idea why I asked for them, maybe I can embarrass Nicki with them some day as a prank as in ""hey remember that time you almost fucked that college kid? Here's a pic LOL...right?"" Just kidding I guess. 

Nicki came into the office crying apologizing to both of us, saying that it was her fault and she felt terrible about the whole thing. Gina was pretty contrite as well saying that she probably used her friendship with Nicki to push the moment way more than was professionally acceptable. I was able to half heartedly accept Gina's apology, but I'm just not sure I'm to understanding it yet. 


So we left, Nicki again begged me not to make any rash decisions about our future. I told her that I'd already said if everything up to this point was the truth, than I'm not leaving but I can't make any promises as to what ""normal"" will be for us now. She said that was ok and recommended that we seek a marriage counselor, I told her that would be great and I'd make every session. 

She has been a pretty big emotional wreck since she got home on Saturday and I don't think she's slept at all (I haven't). She's been trying very hard to be physical with me with things like holding my hand, hugging me, sitting next to me on the couch and that sort of thing...I've been trying to reciprocate but having a very hard time with it. I know she's hurting and I should be the one to comfort her and I'm doing the best I can. 

Here's the thing which a lot of you may disagree with (and that's fine), I feel that if i'm going to stay in this marriage than I need to stay in the marriage 100%. I'm not going to be her warden, I'm not going to ask her to prove where she is or who she's hanging out with and I'm not going to look through her phone. I felt gross doing it yesterday (though it was helpful) and I couldn't bring myself to do it again. I feel that if we're married, then we're married. This isn't something to be brought up in an argument, a ""what about that time you..."" type thing or an excuse or me to go out and creep on hot Instagram girls. If I'm staying, I'm staying 100%. I can't say with certainty that I can force myself to stick to this because Nicki can be a nag from hell and the temptation to pull up a photo and say ""why didn't I remember to get gas? remember that time HotAbs McCool's 9 inch dick was only separated from your ass by fabric?""  may be too much to resist.  (yeah, still got a little spite in me).

But that last crack aside, she's been through a lot and the mother of my adorable little kid deserves love and compassion, even if ""a lot' has been of her own making. So I'm going to go see a movie tonight without her, be mad, call her all sorts of names in my head, scream, punch my steering wheel, throw rocks into the river, have some scotch, get in a bar fight...whatever. Then tomorrow I'm getting up and I'm going to be the husband I was before she left last Sunday. 

I'm also going to hit facebook, gym up and delete a lawyer (wasn't my line but whoever said it on one of the posts really made me laugh). But seriously, in addition to Nicki messing up, this little episode has shown me that I've become a squishy 50 year old despite the fact that I'm 30. A huge reason Nicki and Gina didn't even think to ask me to participate in that shoot is that I don't even resemble a guy who could be with my wife anymore. She's very attractive and while I've got a decent base to work with, I'm not anymore. She looks better than she did in the wedding pictures Gina took for us, I look far worse. So if I'm going to be in this marriage 100%, I need to also be 100% myself or the person I was when I was a practicing purple belt in BJJ or a walk on to my college baseball team. That's been the hardest (but probably the most productive) part of this whole situation is to have to look myself in the mirror and admit...your wife did a softcore porn shoot and while she still loves you, you've let yourself go so bad that she didn't even think to include you. 


So I've already signed back up for BJJ tomorrow and I'm going to talk to my professor about being an instructor again, I'm going to join Nicki in her paleo craziness and maybe even her funky ass MovNat class. Hopefully use this episode to make myself a better person. 


Thank you so much for sticking with me...and a serious thank you again. 


Edit 1 in the morning...so this has been such a crazy experience and I've seen the absolute best and worst of Reddit. From god awful power hungry mods, red pillers, Incels , Pervs and edge lords. But also some truly helpful people who genuinely seemed to care about a stranger and his wife, whether they agreed with his course of action or not. PMs and comments are still rolling in and I'll keep responding if people are interested in my nonsense. 

Just to put this to rest from the PMs, I'm not sharing the pics, I'm not linking ginas page. You're going to have to take my word for it that Nicky is as cute as I say. If you had to do that old game of ""what celebrity do you resemble?"" There's a porn star named Lana Rhodes that has striking resemblance to her face (ironic?). Nic has black hair and striking blue eyes, fit now and not super curvy but balanced If that makes sense. For those who keep asking, that's the best I'm going do, and yes I'm bragging that my wife is quite hot. I look like smashed shit served on a cracker but self esteem is at an all time low and I'm hung over like crazy and uber is taking forever and I have to get my car and still get to work and I'm at least 2 hours late now...I'm going to close the door to my office and sleep this off.

"UPDATE: My girlfriend is falling for another guy, what do I do? FINAL UPDATE","Previous post
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bef1ru/update_all_3_of_us_got_arrested_my_girlfriend_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app


Hey guys.

I figured I'd give you one final update. Unless you guys want another one after court. Let me know.

We are all awaiting court. Mine is in 2 weeks and so is my exes. My ex's boyfriends is in 3 weeks. I don't think they will last though because it's seriously looking like they're gonna do some time. My lawyer is telling me he thinks they might get years. I forgot to add that she actually got charged for Fraud and identity theft as well because apparently she was trying to use my social security card for something. I'm really glad I listened to everyone and called the cops.

She keeps trying to tell me to get back together with her and that she'll break up with the other guy and that we will have the life we were supposed to have. It sounds tempting but as soon as I drop those charges I know she'd run. 

I'm not dropping anything. My son is currently at my house with me. I'm hoping to get full custody. If she somehow avoids jail it's going to be very hard. But I'm going to try. 

That's it guys. I can update after court again if you want. Just let me know. I'm scared for court too because I don't want to go to jail. My ex's grandma is actually paying for all my legal fees because I told her the story and she always liked me and she felt really bad. She also gave me a very very hefty check and told me to take care of myself. My ex also gave me everything she stole from me back thinking it'd help her case. So I don't need to work for probably the next 2 years and I'm going to rent my own apartment and just pay rent for the year in advance and then quit my job for awhile and figure out what I truly want to do in my life. 

My ex is probably reading these as she keeps tabs on this Reddit account. I appreciate all the advice I have been given. I still miss her. I still love her. I still feel empty. If you guys can give any advice on where to go from here I'd appreciate it.


Honestly I'm a bit scared at what she may have planned next. I don't know how far she will go to win against me or whatever she's trying to do. I hope she doesn't try anything serious but until court is over and they are roaming free I do fear for my safety.

I'm probably also going to hire a financial adviser for myself. And get their input on what I should do here. Honestly I may or may not quit. I might need to because of the baby. I make good money but I want to be there for my kid and I also want all my finances in order so it's best to hire someone especially with me being this young I'm nervous to have this amount of money.

I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I don't know what to say to her.,"Hey everyone. I don't know what to do in this situation because I never expected I'd face something like this. I'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but I'm coming up seriously short here.

I met my wife on Tinder at the end of 2015. We talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. By the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. We were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. More than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

I know, heavy topics for a first date. We were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

At the very least I held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. Her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. She immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

We dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. After getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

Four nights ago was the first time I ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. My wife was out with a friend, and I was doing some house cleaning. I was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so I took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. At the bottom I saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case B were visible. I immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

I had known that my wife was on her period because when I tried to initiate sex, she told me so. I found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and I made comment about the timing being odd. She told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. I figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

I haven't told her that I found the box. When she got home that night everything was so normal. I tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

The more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. What if she was assaulted? What if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? What if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? Or, what if she just cheated? I only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of Plan B and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

I don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. We have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. I've done nothing to displease her, at least that I know of. Maybe I'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than I'm giving it credit for. But I feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because I don't know how.

**tl;dr** I found a torn up Plan B box in my trash. The only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. How do I bring this up?",relationship_advice

My two cents and deep concern about this sub.,"Hey all. Me (M28) and my girlfriend (F23) have been long time lurkers on this sub. We have a happy and fulfilling relationship with trust, love, and passion. We have been through our ups and downs, but our relationship is incredible. 

We were reading a post today about a woman who said she found suspicious messages when going through her husbands Facebook. Also in her story she said that their two toddlers were taking up most of the free time and their marriage was hitting a rough spot, like many people struggle with the same situation.

Fast forward to the comments. This is where my concern starts. MISERY LOVES COMPANY. PERIOD. The amount of cutting, negative, ""DIVORCE HIM AND MOVE ON, GOHRL HE LYIN"" comments were unbelievable, and the same goes for almost every top post on this sub...

All I'm saying is be careful, y'all. Especially the younger people who come here for advice. Relationships take work, relationships are hard sometimes, and relationships take compromise. I hope that these folks understand that they're probably taking that cutting ""advice"" from middle aged, three time divorced cat ladies with strange colored hair, or dudes who are manipulative and have never had a successful relationships. Who's got time for that?

Mods, remove this post if I'm breaking any rules. But maybe its a good idea to put some sort of flair on username so people can be a bit more selective about where said advice is coming from. For example ""marriage counseling works"" or ""three times divorced cat lady""

Just my two cents. Sorry about the rant.

My bf (20M) lied to me about wearing a condom. What do I do now??,"I originally posted this on r/sex but was advised to post it here as well to get additional feedback. 

So my bf and I just got a new apartment together a few weeks ago and are kinda new to the living together thing. Since we are still sorting out our financial situation and I'm not on the pill, I asked him to buy condoms bc I didn't want an accident to happen and I either have to buy an emergency contraceptive or end up pregnant. He initially said no but after about 2 days he agreed (although rather grumpily). Tonight during sexy time, he wore a condom and then afterwards took it off and threw it away. A little while later, he asked if I wanted to go for round two and I agreed. I felt him reach for another condom and heard the crinkling of the wrapper and even him opening the wrapper so naturally I assumed he put a new one on. Midway through, he asked if he could take off the condom and I told him no. He  then told me that he actually hadn't been wearing one the whole time during round two. I immediately got out from under him and got upset. I felt like he broke my trust. He then actually put the condom on and said for me to calm down and that he was just playing around and wanted to continue since he now had a condom on. I was still very upset and told him no bc that's not cool. He got angry and took the condom off and threw it at the wall. I then got dressed and went to the spare bedroom. I heard him get out of bed and close the door after me. After cooling down for a few hours, I was going to go back and talk to him but I found the door locked. He locked me out of the room. I then texted him that I was sorry but that he shouldn't have done that. I little bit later and I heard snoring in the room and the door is still locked so I'm staying in the guest bedroom tonight. I am still kinda upset and can't shake the feeling of betrayal. I personally don't think that I'm in the wrong but maybe I'm just too close to the situation. Am I the bad guy?? Am I overreacting?? Does he have a right to be mad at me?? Please give any advice you may have. I would really appreciate it.

UPDATE: First of all, I just wanted to say that I didn't expect to get so much interaction let alone well wishes and support. I am so thankful for everyone and although I can't reply to every comment, I'm at least trying to look at them all. Also, I am back on birth control. Now on to what happened yesterday. 

When I woke up Friday morning, bf was already up and getting ready for work. As soon as he left, I went into his room and started gathering my belongings to move into the guest bedroom. I guess he forgot something bc he came back inside and found me in his room collecting my things. He told me that he loved me and that he was sorry for what he did and he shouldn't have been the one to get mad. He also said that although he didn't want me to, he wouldn't stop me from moving my things into the guest bedroom if that's what I wanted. I should have said something to him then but I knew that what I had to say was a lot more than the 10 minutes he had before he had to leave for work so I stayed quiet and looked at the floor. He hugged me and called me his baby and then left for work fr this time. We didn't speak anymore until later that evening when I asked him if he could pick me up from work (I currently don't have a car). He agreed. During the ride home, he acted casually as if nothing had happened less than 24 hours before. When we got home, bf started cooking dinner. I didn't know how to start the conversation so I sat and thought on it. Later that night, I went into his room and he already knew why I was in there. I told him that what he did the night before was NOT okay and that since we got the apartment he had been meaner and way more aggressive toward me which lead me to think that he didn't actually want to get the apartment. I reminded him of the condom incident and a few others before that and told him if he wanted to break the lease, we could and that I would find another place to stay in the meantime. He started crying and apologized and said that he didn't even realize what he was doing and that he didn't want to be like his dad (who was very abusive). He said that it wasn't his intention and that he was very sorry. He also said that he loved getting the apartment and wanted to stay. He also said that if I wanted to keep my stuff in the guest bedroom, he would respect and support my decision and that I was welcome to the master with him whenever I felt like it. He said that he appreciates me telling him about his fuck ups so he can learn from them and that he'd do his best to be better. Then we said good night and I went back to my room.

Coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if I don't have sex with him.,"So a guy I know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. I thought I had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but I guess he somehow found the video. We work in the finance industry and I do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. The guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

This is also because I went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

So, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, I'll just call myself H, he found revenge porn of me online. At first I was relieved that it was him cause I've known him for so many years and thought I could trust him. Then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. Horrified I push him away. He then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if I come over to his place and have sex with him. Other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

We're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. That day I just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

He's told me that I should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. Over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

I feel so betrayed, since I thought we were good friends. and I'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. I've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

If anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

Tl;Dr- Coworker found revenge porn of me online. He's been sexually harassing me and Is threatening to share it if I don't have sex with him.

Edit- Many people are telling me to go to the police. It's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. He is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. He's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone I know if I don't have sex with him. 
Also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. I'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

Donald Duck is an infinitely better character than Mickey Mouse,"I really don't know how Mickey has become so iconic because he's frankly quite boring. He has almost no flaws as a character, and he's the best at anything he tries, especially in the comic books. 

Mickey has a very undefined character, you don't know much about him, except for the fact that he's... A friendly mouse with friends? While Donald is a down on his luck, scrappy, adventurous Indiana Jones type, if he was a single parent with anger management issues.

Mickey's supporting characters are: gender swapped himself who loves him unconditionally, Goofy who's actually a much better character, and a bunch of bad Goofy clones like Horace the horse.

Donald has: the nephews who got better with each iteration (except for the sk8r 90s 2cool4skool phase) , Scrooge - his rich uncle with the deepest and most complex backstory in all of disneydom, Daisy who to be fair is also basically a gender swapped him/romantic interest, but what makes this relationship way more interesting is the fact that they are dysfunctional as fuck.

[Update] Help. Animals were killed by neighbor's wolf dog.,"Here's an update from my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/88zvrf/help_animals_were_killed_by_neighbors_wolf_dog).

We had lost various animals to our neighbor's wolf dog. One of our sheep had survived the attack and we had taken her to the vet since our neighbor had agreed to cover the costs. She had also agreed to replace the other animals we had lost to her dog. The vet costs were more than our neighbor had bargained for an she decided she had done enough. 

So as suggested, I went ahead and sent a demand letter against my neighbor for the animals that her wolf dog had killed. I recounted our version of the events and asked to be compensated for the animals we had lost. I sent it on 4/6/18 and never heard back from her. On 5/21/18, I went ahead and filed a small claims against her. When I went to file, I had my demand letter and proof that she had signed for it with me. The clerk (who later turned out to be the county's Justice of the Peace) told me that she did not need those documents, only my form for the suit. That I would have to bring those copies in when a court date was set. At some point my neighbor was served. On 6/6/18 I received a notarized letter from her where she stated her side of the story and said she did not feel she owed us anything, since she had paid for the vet bill and her dog had been killed. She went on to put the blame on the fact that we lived in a rural are. And she tried to pass the blame on other dog's in the area that would roam with her dog. 

Now, I'm aware that I live in a rural area. But we haven't lost any more animals since her dog was killed. Our animals aren't constantly being chased by her dog. As for the other dogs she refernced, they no longer come into our property. Either way, we looked forward to pleading our case. 

On 6/15/18, I received the court letter with our court date. On 6/22/18, I received a call from the Justice of the Peace's office, the clerked advised me that I needed to bring in a copy of the vet bill. This threw me for a loop since I had not mentioned a vet bill in my suit and I was not allowed to leave a copy of my demand letter. Either way, I made copies of everything I had. Including screenshots from a video, where their wolf dog refused to leave the sheep carcass on our property. 

I had court yesterday, and I lost. 

While we waited for our trial to begin, she was catching up with the constable that was assigned to our case. While it is a small town, it made me feel uneasy that she was obviously friends with him. Our trial was in a small court room, my witnesses were not allowed inside until they were asked to tell their version of events. She was allowed to bring in her husband. He was allowed to question me and he blamed me for not telling him sooner. He was rude and arrogant. Their whole strategy was that I should have told them about their dog being a problem. The problem was mine. She also accused me of fabricating my story since for some reason the police report noted that we had lost 80 chickens when we had really lost 8. I simply stated that it was possible it was a typo, the whole report had errors. When she did this, I pointed out how her story had changed from the notarized letter she sent me. In the letter she stated that she had seen her dogs and other dogs eating something on our property but she drove on. When she got back from the doctor, she saw that there was a dead animal and she decided to come see what had happened. In court, she said that she stopped by as soon as she had see her dog attacking our sheep. What actually happened, she didn't stop by til she saw a deputy at our house. 

During the trial, she brought up that our dogs pee on our property and had photos of them on her property. I'm not sure how that was relevant but the judge took it as evidence. I'm not justifying that our dogs be allowed on her property. That's something I aim to fix but her property isn't even fenced off. So I'm confused at how this was relevant. Additionally, at one point her husband argued with me that I was probably just seeing a coyote on our property and that I had simply confused it with their dog. I confused a coyote with a white husky like dog wearing a red collar. 

The judge favored with my neighbors. She stated that I had no other proof that their dog was responsible for our other animals. That she had paid enough with the vet bill and that in the future I should try to notify my neighbors of what their dogs are doing. I needed to have photos ready of every single time I saw that dog on our property. 

I was floored. I felt like my case was built around their testimony. Am I wrong in feeling this way?

My (14F) mother's friend (35M) made me uncomfortable. Advice?,"I'll call my mothers friend Ron. Ron comes around a lot, I've known him for a couple of years so I trust him. I was walking home alone around 3 pm yesterday.

 I see his car pull up close to me, and he offers me a ride because my home was a 10 minute walk away. Because I trust Ron, I get in the car with him. This is the first time we've been alone. We start a normal conversation, but it slowly changes towards boyfriends and asking me if I have one. When he pulled up to my house, my mother wasn't home. 

He starts rubbing his hand on my thigh while I'm in the passenger seat and asks if he can come inside and wait for my mom. I told him no because my mom will be awhile. He insists. When we went inside, thank God my older sister was there. When he saw she was there, he decided to leave. As he was leaving, I felt a little 'pinch' on my ass as he was walking from behind me. I was so nervous I didn't know what to do. How should I tell my mom? Should I just ignore it? I'm just really confused. I've always trusted Ron.

[Update] Mother in law suing for visitation in ny.,"On mobile. Also, this is gonna be a bit long. 

Here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aq9o11/mother_in_law_is_suing_for_visitation_ny/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

We went to court for our initial hearing in February. I asked for dismissal citing Troxel V. Granville. The judge agreed that we were within our rights, however she couldn't grant a dismissal because my MIL requested an attorney. The judge advised she didnt qualify for an appointed lawyer so she should seek representation through elder law. My MIL begins raising her hands and waving them around asking if she could be allowed to speak. She states in court that me and my wife bully, abuse, belittle, and swear around the children constantly. The first 3 are outright lies and the 4th, so fucking what? She also stated that she never mentioned once being hacked or being obsessed that she was hacked, and that my oldest daughter was the one obsessed with hacking and spying. The judge made no comments and advised her that we weren't keeping her away from the children and that she should seek relief by visiting them under our supervision. 

Fast forward to a week before the hearing we have to meet with the kaw guardian for the children. We show the law guardian all the insane conspiracy theory texts and the texts where she accuses me of hacking her phone. She spoke with the children and we took our leave. The paperwork we received stated that my MIL showed her a much different conversation. My MIL had deleted the texts that made her look bad and copy pasted several from my wife that made my wife look like a bully and that she was harassing my MIL. The children outright denied any bullying/abuse and stated to the law guardian that my MIL makes them uncomfortable because she is constantly yelling at them, when they want to leave she wont them go and she wont stop talking about who is hacking her. So obviously she supports our position. 

In the hearing my lawyer asked for dismissal, and requested we be paid our legal fees by MIL as the petition was brought in bad faith. My MILs appointed attorney couldnt withdraw and refile an amended petition because MIL wouldnt let her so the judge dismissed and awarded us our legal fees. 

I havent seen the judgement yet but it's my understanding that it was dismissed with prejudice. However my MIL doesnt live in reality and is going to file another petition alleging that I've brainwashed my children. I wish that were true, they never listen to me. So I may have another update for you all shortly, but for now I'll enjoy my victory.",legaladvice

TIFU by taking a picture of my wife's ass,"This happened about a week ago.

&#x200B;

I  took my wife to Barns & Noble to get some new books for us to read.  I was half halfheartedly looking at different books while trailing my wife throughout the store. At some point I realize my wife is nowhere to be  seen, but whatever I'll find her eventually.

&#x200B;

After  a few minutes of mindless wandering, I notice her on the other side of  the store. I also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as I'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, I hear someone behind me shout ""HEY CREEP! WHY ARE YOU  TAKING A PICTURE OF THAT GIRLS ASS!?"" I turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

I  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. My wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that I had to leave. She explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&#x200B;

The employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. Honestly I'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. It was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. Shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&#x200B;

TL;DRI took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. My wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. Everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  

And before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows I do this. Yes, my wife is more than okay with it. She does the same thing to me.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify, my wife already had the picture in hand when she went up to confirm to the manager we were indeed married. The manager never doubted her affirmation that we were indeed married. I'm pretty sure she just wanted to show off her wedding dress again. 

Edit2: I have asked the wife if I can share a picture and she has declined. Sorry folks, enjoy this [tiny ass](https://m.imgur.com/aqQoeRa?r) as compensation. ",tifu
"My mother is on her deathbed, I am her only child, she does not have a Will and cannot sign one in her current state, her caregiver for the past 20 years just put my mother's house in her own name. Is there anything I can do?","This is currently happening in Kansas. Because there is no Will I understand her estate will go into probate. The caregiver/woman, let's call her Becky, has lived in her house the past 20 years and has a dark past. Although I am grateful to Becky in many ways for caring for my mom, she has lived in the house and has been my mother's power of attorney for the past 10 years. Becky has been spending my mother's social security and disability checks which amount to over $3,500/month. My mother was a teacher for 30+ years and had/has really good retirement. Becky is a certifiable hoarder and has filled the house with piles and piles of cheap junk over the past 20 years. I mean, we're talking about the conditions where you see hoarders on TV where there are small pathways to walk and everything else is piled high with stacks and stacks of, I don't know what. Becky doesn't even use the entire basement which was previously her living space, because of all of the stuff so densely packed. Now the upstairs is looking more and more like the basement. Due to M.S. my mother has been bed-ridden for the past five years. During this time Becky has been taking care of her with periodic help from Nurses and Aids. My mom is now in Hospice care and has been having small to medium strokes. I am told the end is near. I have visited her multiple times and Becky told me after she passes and makes all the arrangements, she will sell the house and we will split the profits. She wasn't specific. I am the only child, there is no one else. I found out today that Becky had to pay $300 to get the house in her name. I didn't even realize this was possible. Becky has mountains of debt even with my mom's checks she cashes each month along with her own disability check of around $1,000/month, Becky has always been in debt and has lived like this for a couple of decades. This is Kansas which is super cheap as far as taxes and cost of living. She always has excuses for where the money goes each month. I can't keep track of her terrible spending month after month. And Becky gets super angry and defensive whenever I approach the subject. I have a feeling that when my mom eventually dies, Becky won't want to leave the house. Or she will leave and pocket the entire money from the sale of the house. I'm sure she will have some sob story or excuse for why she needs it. She is already talking about getting multiple storage facilities for her piles of crap. I'm not sure what to do or if there is anything I can do. If anyone has an idea of where I could start I would appreciate it.

Edit: Thank you all so very much for the great advice. I am going to contact the adult care tomorrow and a lawyer first thing on Monday morning. I am a good person and will definitely consider Becky in all final decisions. I intend to split the estate with her, but this is not my main concern. Becky is ill herself and has taken advantage of my mom, however I do believe she loves her as a close friend. Becky has made horrible choices and due to past family trauma I allowed this for many years because I just didn't have the capacity to deal. I am ashamed of this, but am now ready to buck up as Becky doesn't have the mental sense or financial restraint to handle this on her own. Thanks again!",legaladvice
UPDATE: I (19F) had a summer fling with an older guy (26M). I took a pregnancy test today and it came out positive,"Edit: Wow! Thank you so much for my first gold, kind stranger! That's really sweet. Hugs! <3

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/901lyn/i_19f_had_a_summer_fling_with_an_older_guy_26m_i/

First of all, thank you all so so much for the overwhelming support. I never imagined that I would get this amount of positive support and advice for my situation. When I posted, I was in a pretty bad place (I think I typed the post out on my bathroom floor where I had been crying). Thank you all for the reassurance and comfort. Also, thank you so much to all the girls that shared their personal experiences. I read every single comment (good and bad) and tried to respond to all of them. I appreciate all of you guys so much and it honeslty helped me cope a lot. 

Special thank you to u/Janaya59, your comment was the turning point for me. I got myself up from the bathroom floor, took a shower, opened a bucket of ice cream and calmed down for the rest of the night. 

About two days after I posted, I told one of my best friends about my positive pregancy test. He was completely supportive and reassured me that all was going to be okay. He drove me to my doctor's appointment and sat in the doc's office while I peed in a cup and got my blood drawn. I was positive for hCG so the pregnancy was real. I was about five weeks. He held me as I cried and on the way back, bought take-out for the both of us. 

That day, I called a local clinic, scheduled my appointment for Wednesday. I was early enough to take Mifeprex (the pill). On Tuesday, my best friend (the one that I mentioned in my original post) finally came back from Africa and I told her immediately. She hugged me close and I cried some more (the waterworks were very common during that whole week) and she cried for me as well. 

On the day of my appointment, both of my best friends came with me. I took Mifeprex at the clinic and got the misoprostol to take at home. Right after I took the Mifeprex, I felt complete and utter relief. It felt better than the day I finished all of my college applications. All of my stress instantly dissipated. I knew I was going to be okay and that I had my life back on track. My friends drove me back and we all hung out at my dorm and ate ice cream. I'm so lucky to have friends like them in my life and I'm so thankful for them.

So yes, I had the abortion and I feel completely relieved.

One thing that I did do that I said I probably wasn't was that I told ""Nick"". I was completely set on not telling him since we were never in a relationship (we had a summer fling) and we hadn't seen each other in like a month. But I hate keeping secrets, especially when it comes to myself, and I thought that if I do end up getting a position at the lab, I would see him everyday. It would be very difficult for me to see him and know that I kept this from him when he played somewhat of a role in it too. He's also someone that never gave me any red flags and I was also 99% sure that he was going to be in support of an abortion. So I texted him the day after I made my appointment asking him to meet up for coffee. I told him, managed not to break out in tears, and then told him I already schdued the abortion. He was completely shocked, thanked me for telling him then got up and hugged me. He said he absolutely supported my decision and thanked me for choosing it. He then got up and hugged me again. He offered to come with me and pay for the pill and I told him no and no but thanked him for his offer and support. He told me to call him if anything came up or if I needed anything. I nodded, and then asked him if he could not say anything about all of this and he wholeheartedly said absolutely. And that was that. 

I could tell he was relieved and I expected it since he's a talented and successful med student who doesn't even have time to take care of himself, nonetheless a pregnant girl and a baby. 

In all, I made the right choice and had an amazing support system. Thank you especially to Reddit since you guys gave me unconditional support while I was at my lowest. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 

TL;DR: Got the abortion and told Nick about it. I feel like a complete planet has been lifted off of my shoulders. Life's good and back on track.

He needed to shower first since he had work, so I searched for a towel to wipe my face with in the meantime. I looked in his bedroom and saw a towel under the bed.

AITA for making my MIL pay for food I ordered after she ruined the one we had?,"My wife and I were hosting a barbecue on sunday. Half an hour before the guests arrived we were busy preparing food and my MIL was helping us.

While I was busy doing something else I asked my MIL to take the pasta salad I had prepared out of the fridge and taste for seasoning. She said that it needed more salt and I told her to add it, but not use the big salt shaker we have, because too much comes out of it. She used it anyways and oversalted the dish. I was really angry and tried to fix it with more mayo but it just didn't taste good. I told my MIL that I would have to order a new pasta salad from a local place, which she said wasn't necessary but I did anyways. About 15 minutes after the guests arrived I see the delivery guy at our front door. I tell my MIL to get up and she asks why. I tell her that the delivery guy is here so she can pay him. She looks at me stunned and asks ""why should I pay him"". So I have to expain that because she ruined the pasta salad she has to pay for the new one. She finally gets up to pay him but it's incredibly awkward and my wife is giving me the death stare. The guests seem kinda awkward too and my MIL didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the party.

After the guests were gone my wife flipped her shit at me. She called me an imbecile and an asshole and said that I embarassed myself and damaged the realationship to her mother. It's been three days and she's still angry about this. AITA?

Edit: Ok, I think the judgement has been clear. I will try to fix it, although I'm not sure yet how to.

How can I hide my depression from my dog?,"This sounds so stupid.. but whatever, here we are. 

I am very depressed. I cry most days, I go to work and come home and don't really do much but stare at my wall, don't have any friends etc. 

I play with my dog a lot, take her on long walks, and take care of her because she doesn't need to suffer just because I do. But I can tell it makes her sad when I'm sad. She whimpers and tries to climb all over me and lick my face until I stop crying. I've tried to just smile a lot and use sweet voices to her but I can literally tell she is not buying it. She just ignores the toys I throw for her and treats and tries to comfort me instead. 

Is there something I can do to trick her? 

Edit: Thank you to all of you. You're all really supportive, understanding, and sweet human beings. I really appreciate it. Apparently you can't trick your dog so I'm just gonna try and do my best to get better for her. ",NoStupidQuestions

TIFU by masturbating in front of my entire family,"This happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

Stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. Aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which I was extremely anxious about. All together, I was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager I am, I often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

So, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, I lay down in my living room with my family, watching TV. I dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. Being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since I had done next to no study at the time). 

Not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, I decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

And so off I went. Except I forgot one thing.

I was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

Somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that I was not in fact sitting with my family by our TV, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

I don't really understand how or why it happened. A few seconds in and I began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

I snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment I put myself in. 

I'm not going to talk about what happened next, as I don't want to relive the next few moments.

My father is just disappointed. He hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

My mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as I write this. 

And I'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. I find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe I was just dreaming while I was gassed up. 

But it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

I let my friend's husband watch her on video call,"Okay listen...moved from r/AITA

My friend ""Sarah"" is on her 3rd marriage at 29. She's got an alcohol problem and gets herself into stupid situations and has cheated on all her partners since I've known her. Her current husband is a great guy, but kind of naive. He really has no clue - he just loves her so much. A couple weeks ago he stopped by my work, and after some small talk he straight up asked me if I had seen or heard of Sarah seeing other men. I told him I honestly didn't know, because I don't \*know\* 100%. He seemed really beat. It was awful. Fast forward to this past weekend, few of our friends got together, and she started to tell us about some dude she met. I was a little buzzed, so I decided to try to sneak her on video. I clicked on my contacts and sent him a video call and he actually picked up. I pretended to be into my phone and just let it roll. He ended the call abut 2 mins in but it was enough to hear what she was talking about. The next day I felt sick at myself for what I did, but my husband thinks he needed to find out, and deep down I do too. I have no idea what's going on or if Sarah's husband even confronted her. Am I the worst person ever?

AITA for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?,"Throwaway because my sister knows my Reddit. 

I'm getting married next year and I'm so excited about it. My fiancé has all his groomsmen picked out, and I'm in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I'd also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I'm sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. 

I drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he'd be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said ""Will you be a part of my Bride Tribe?"", deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E's ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.

Fast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E's reaction didn't go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to ""fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold"" despite his transition. I tried to explain that I'd picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn't get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me ""basic"" and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.

I guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he'd be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he's still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it's best if he isn't a part of the bridal party. My fiancé says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I'm being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. She says I should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. She says I should give E a second chance and if I don't it will cause all kinds of family drama.

Would I be the asshole if I refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

ETA: 
Wow, I cannot believe how much this blew up. So I'm going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

E sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for ""snapping at me"". He admitted he was wrong and it was ""totally out of line"" and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party ""if I'd have him"". Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven't sent any response yet. 

A also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

ALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E.",AmItheAsshole

"Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","Mostly what's in the title. Condo was vacant for roughly 60 days between closing and our attempt to move in. Upon getting there with our belongings, we discovered a new deadbolt on the door - the unit was vacant and had no deadbolt when we did our final walkthrough the day before closing. Tried knocking on the door. got no answer, reached out to our realtor, who contacted the seller's agent and asked that he get in touch with his client to find out what the hell is going on, but at this point we assumed squatters. About an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. All $1 of it. He told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

Our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. The police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. The condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as I plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

To me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but I am nowhere near a lawyer. To that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but I am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

I have no idea what to do here. Luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. Unluckily, my wife and I turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

I'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. Beyond that, do I have grounds to evict him? If so, how do I recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? Does the tenant have any sort of liability here? If I do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can I sue the seller for that as well? What about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? Is there anything else that I am not thinking of?

I am shaking with anger right now so I apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

Edit: Location is New York, specifically Putnam County.

**Update (4:45PM):** I just got a call from my attorney's admin. He's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me. Apparently he was a civil litigator before he ""retired"" to real estate law, and she thinks he'll welcome an excuse to step into his old shoes and tear these people apart. Needless to say I am looking forward to hearing from him.

**Update 2 (5:25PM):** Just heard from both my realtor and my attorney. The evening seems to have found a way to get even more interesting, but the truck owning friend is about five minutes out with my car. We're going to meet my realtor for dinner, my closing documents and some badly needed drinks (said the guy who doesn't really drink). I'll update tomorrow morning if not tonight, but till then...

It was a beautiful ceremony, however I did find some things strange. For instance, the priest never said, ""You may now kiss the bride"", but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

"AITA for refusing to adopt my SIL's child unless I'm the only one called ""mom""?","Ok, backstory. My (27F) husband's (29M) older sister (36F) had a child when she was 19 from a one night stand. He was adopted by a nice couple a couple states over in an open adoption. They will send her pictures, are friends on Facebook and occasionally have little get togethers. He calls her ""Mama T"", as her name starts with a T. Although she does not celebrate mother's day with him, she asks those around her to wish her a happy mother's day and becomes depressed when she is not acknowledged. She is very active in birth mother groups and speaks annually at a camp on birth mother's trauma and issues. She is unmarried and has always desperately wanted to have a family and children.

Also for reasons that are not relevant (medical), my husband and I have decided adoption is the best idea as we cannot/will not have a biological child together naturally.

About 6 months ago, T announced that she is pregnant again. She told us she wants to have the baby but, once again, is not in a financial position to keep the child. So she's looking for adoptive families. Our families all know that we have been looking to adopt and so she came to us about possibly adopting her child.

My husband thinks it would be a good idea. The timing is right and his sister is a ""known quantity"", as he put it. IE we know she isn't doing drugs or drinking. I'm not opposed, but I had some concerns. For one thing, I don't want my child calling anyone else ""mom"". We also live 45 minutes away, and from the way she acts from her first child's birthday and mother's day, I'm not sure it would be healthy for anyone involved.

After discussions, last weekend we went to T and told her we would be willing to adopt her child. She and my MIL were thrilled, as the only other prospective birth parents she had spoken to were 2000 miles away. Until I told T that she would be Aunt T, not Mama T. She freaked on me. Told me that I was trying to erase her role as birth mother from the child's life. I told her that the child would be very aware they were adopted and that T was their birth mother, but they would not be referring to her or treating her as a mother. She burst into tears and said I was trying to take her baby from her. I told her that, if we adopted it, it wouldn't be her baby anymore. That... didn't go over well.

My MIL has decided to stay out of this issue as much as possible. The entire rest of the family, who lives nearer to them, has been telling me that I'm being heartless and selfish and taking out my misery of being unwilling (they all know I'm capable) to bear children on her. My husband supports me in front of them. He has said that if we aren't united then we won't do it, but has also privately expressed to me how nice it would be to have a child genetically related to him. I guess he didn't realize how strongly he felt about passing on his genes until the option was back on the table?

Edit 3, months later: Turns out you were all right. She was projecting because she was keeping guys on the side.

My [22f] boyfriend's [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile,"Hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

I don't really know how to begin so I'm just gonna dive right in. We've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and I have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

Last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. This took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. His parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. To the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

The problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. He has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. He talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. Cool, I thought. That all sounds beautiful. 

We didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. It was on a day I was working so I couldn't go with him and when I asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. I was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

I did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

It was definitely a shock but I reacted positively and told him it looked really good. It was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

It's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. Colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. I can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. Bf is super proud of it and I honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

My only issue with it is during sex. 

It takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. It doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo REALLY stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

Not to mention this thing is like the Mona fu*cken Lisa. 

Any position that we're facing each other in, I always end up making eye contact with it. And every time I do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. Every time. Ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, I doubt I would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of ANY six year old. 

It's honestly ruining our sex life. 

I haven't told my bf any of this because I feel like I can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (I know lasers exist but I doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

Lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where I'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried I'm not attracted to him anymore.

I am attracted to him. I'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

What can I do in this situation? The thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. But looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

Should I talk to him? Am I overreacting? Is our sex life officially dead? 

Thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- My boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and I can't stop making eye contact with it during sex.

Update: This has gotten a lot more attention than I anticipated. Some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. I'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. Currently debating whether I should just let fate take the wheel on this one.

""Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative. He kept telling me how great it was going to be.

Husband #2 was in software services. He was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.

Husband #3 was from field services. He said everything checked out diagnostically, but he just couldn't get the system up.

Husband #4 was in telemarketing. Even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.

Husband #5 was an engineer. He understood the basic process, but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.

Husband #6 was from finance and administration. He thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.

Husband #7 was in marketing. Although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.

Husband #8 was a psychologist. All he ever did was talk about it.

Husband #9 was a gynecologist. All he did was look at it. 

Husband #10 was a stamp collector. All he ever did was... God! I miss him!

But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!"" 

""Good,"" said the new husband, ""but, why?""

TIFU by going too hard while masturbating.,"This was a few months ago, but I was just slapping the ol' beef and didn't really have a ton else to do. Came a few times, figured I could go for one more. At this point the dick was getting kinda flappy but I figured if I went hard enough it would work itself out. After a while of jerking, my arm started to get tired so I switched arms. Started again with renewed vigor and went basically as fast as I could, squeezing for more feeling. I started squeezing tighter and tighter as my arm got more tired and I kinda started to tense up everywhere, and suddenly I heard like a physical rip and felt excruciating pain from my Willy. Looked down to examine and there were broken blood vessels in a ring around the base of my dick. I then had to figure out how to get my pants back on and drive myself to the hospital without passing out. Ended up in a dick cast type thing for a few weeks, now I'm really horny but afraid to masturbate. 

TL,DR: tried finishing too many times, almost tore my dick off.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that unfortunately I don't have any pics cause I was too embarrassed of the situation. It wasn't exactly a dick cast like one on your arm necessarily, but more of just kind of a thing to hold it in place while it healed. Peeing was interesting. They gave me some medicine to help it not fill with blood every now and then (like if I was to randomly pop a boner) which sorta helped. This was the first time I told anyone about this cause I was pretty embarrassed. Nothing like confessing your idiocracy to Reddit!

META Our potential assholes are asking us to judge moral disputes. Top-level comments focused solely on legal aspects or ownership are not compelling,"If the OPs wanted legal advice, they wouldn't be here on AITA. There's another popular sub for that. Someone can be TA because they're *morally* in the wrong while legally in the right. If you don't believe me, ask RBN subscribers about their parents.

These are weak justifications

* I pay the rent/mortgage so I can make all the rules
* I pay the internet bill so I can turn off the wifi whenever I feel like it
* Neighbor's cat/tree/child is their property/dependent so they must cover all associated costs

The *legal* standing of someone's actions or inactions are only one of the points when deciding whether someone is TA. The flip side of this is someone's getting upset or offended is only one point too. Human conflicts are complicated and often don't have one party or the other completely to blame. That's why this sub is fun to read and comment in!

UPDATE (should I (26F) reach out to my long lost brother (18M) that doesn't know I exist?),"So I posted a long time ago about a delimna to reach out to a brother that I was seperated from when he was a baby. For the details you can see the original post


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7spomt/should_i_26f_reach_out_to_my_long_lost_little/?utm_source=reddit-android



I first want to say thank you to anyone who re2aponded.


I decided I would reach out to my brother once he graduated high school, which he did this past summer. I called my older brother, we will call him A, and asked him if he was ready to reach out to him with me and he said he needed to wait just a little longer because he was going to be super busy at work for a while and wanted to have time available to dedicate to talking to our brother. So we waited a little longer..


Well a month passed, and A called me and said he was ready. We decided to message him on fb. I basically said ""I know this is out of the blue, and I'm not sure how to say this but I am your sister. If you would like to talk or meet up let me know.""


I was expecting to wait a long time for a reply and for it to possibly not be positive. To my surprise he replied back pretty quickly and said he knew I was his sister and that he had wanted to reach out to me but he was afraid. We continued talking and he was so open and happy to speak to A and I. The crazy thing is, he hadn't known about us until only a month prior when an Uncle told him. I had been stalking his facebook for years wanting to talk to him but always feeling like it wasnt the right time and when I finally felt it was right, he just so happened to of just found out. It is like the stars aligned.


We have been messaging and talking on the phone for half a week until we finally met in person today. It is crazy how talking to him feels so natural. He is a wonderful kid, and a young and very loving father. We are really enjoying finding out all our similarities and laughing at our differences. 


As for my Dad, he is happy that we have found each other. He looks forward to the day he gets to meet my brother. But that day will be when my brother is ready. He wants to build a relationship with A and I first while he processes his feelings about our Dad. We will see when that day comes but there is currently no rush.",relationship_advice
"AITA for ""tattling"" on my boyfriend to his mother","My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

Since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. He'll sit on the couch and play video games and he'll only tend to her while she's screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I'm in the middle of doing something right then, he'll ask me why I can't just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he's watching tv and she's calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won't get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We've talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I've told him I can't handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

I'm honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was going out. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn't trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what's going on.

She called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he's upset with me for involving his mother and for ""taking a video out of context."" I'm at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?

I (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f),"So our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so I gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. Turned out to be new activations, no big deal. Although, while on the main page I noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. Shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. I expect her to have a lot of texts. I got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when I text her at work cause shes busy.....Who could she be texting? I decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

I honestly dont know what to think. My curiosity got to me and I started plowing through old phone bills. This number started showing up on August the 8th. Since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. Often into the wee hours of the morning. Shes never mentioned any new friends... 

So I get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and I start helping her find it. I found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. I HATE being that guy but I did it. Checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. Some dude . She has him programmed first and last name. Checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. Looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and I also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! Said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

I love my wife and I trust her completely, i think. I dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. Or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. And actually now that I think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 I really dont like the direction this is heading. Am I reading to much into this? We've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. We havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. Not for lack of trying on my part. Shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. Anyone have any advice?

AITA for wanting a sunrise wedding?,"Every year on our anniversary, my fiance and I wake up early to go to the beach and watch the sunrise together. It's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. 

We decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. Our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody Marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). After that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. Our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from Canada, but that's unavoidable.

Based on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.

We've been getting a LOT of backlash from our families about this, who say this is way too early and we need to move the ceremony to a more ""normal"" time of day. But my fiance and I don't feel like we're asking for anything that unreasonable. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling the people sitting next to me at a restaurant that not all Asian people are Chinese?,"I'm currently sitting at a Malaysian restaurant.

The woman of the pair keeps saying how she doesn't know about Chinese food because 'they eat weird things' then spent 5 min berating the waitress about how the menu is large but there are very few gluten free options. When the waitress walked away from taking their order the guy commented on how he loves Chinese restaurants because the waitresses are all very nice and helpful. He then turned to me (I'm not Asian) and tried to engage me in their convo asking me about one of the items I ordered. 

At this point I was annoyed and instead of explaining 'what type of Chinese dish' I am eating, told him flatly that we aren't eating Chinese food and that there are almost no Chinese people sitting in this restaurant eating. Actually most of the people

I told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn't even know what happened, but reading online I don't know if that's true.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

With it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn't. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don't know if I can.

TIFU almost eating my cousin out in her office,"(UPDATE AT BOTTOM!)

This happened yesterday. I can't wait until it's much further away than that.

So this is a throwaway, I have \*(had) another account where I like to post nudes of myself. That can be your judgement, and why I do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but I do. As a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies I get are from guys. But occasionally I get replies from girls who frequent these subs. My face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. Just my... ya know, body.

So I had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. Our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. She said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. A lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use Kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

She is from a large city on the other side of the country as I am, but conveniently I was traveling there next week (this week). We started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. She worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. This idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. We decided I would carry an envelope and say its for office ""XXX,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. No names needed.

Most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared WAAAY too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. We literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. And lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

So along comes yesterday, the big day. I'm so worked up. She's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. Shows me that she is already masturbating. Etc. Oh lord, etc. I text her and tell her I'm in the building. I get to her office, my heart is racing but I'm beyond excited. I see the receptionist, tell her I need a signature from office ""XXX"" and she points me in the right direction. As I walk up, I see the name on the door. My cousins name. My first cousin, who I have known my whole entire life. My cousin, who I spend every holiday with and am very close with. It can't be, I think.

So I knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. And she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. I just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""Heyyyy Cousin, I was in town and thought I'd stop by!"" She is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""OMG COUSIN!"" and gets up to hug me. I literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. She tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

I race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. She surely thinks this guy ghosted her, I really don't think she thought it was me. Maybe I read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. I'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. I don't know really though. I texted her later and told her I was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. We're supposed to get a drink tonight. I'm petrified and don't know how in god's name I will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  It's hard to reply to all of the comments, so I'll say some stuff here.  She works for a very large company in a very large city.  She told me what floor to go, I honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    I DO know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if I wanted.  Like I said, it's a big company, and not a shock that I could pop in.

Yes she is on reddit but I highly doubt she will see this post.  She told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  Headed out for drinks now.  Wish me luck guys.  I think i'm going to be honest.  I don't know.

edit 3:  Well, first of all, Id like to address everyone calling BS on this.  It seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  I agree and would call BS reading this also.   I can't really defend it or prove it (or can I?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, I could give a shit!)

• She doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• She lives in NYC, it's big.  The buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. It didn't occur to me, I guess I was worked up.

• I come here often, it's not that I didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

• In our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  There was no door man or anyone else I needed to get past.  I don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• We didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

• Yes guys post nudes to reddit, I would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• I'm 35, she's 26.

• I deleted my account after freaking out, but I'm sure I'll post again and I'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

I decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  And as many of you guessed, she knew. She didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  She figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that I knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  I assured her I didn't, it was really weird.  We slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  We complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  We talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  And then we had another drink.  And then I licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  I stroked myself while I did it, and after I made her cum she helped me out.  We promised we would never do this again, but I think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.

AITA for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip,"Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

Me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn't want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
We also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn't want to go through that again in this one.

The fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.

Anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

First I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be ""discovering herself"" on this trip, and when I asked why hadn't she told me she said because I wouldn't have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)

Well an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this:

Me: ""you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out""

I believe it was the right thing to do as she didn't pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn't have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

That night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?

UPDATE: I (27M) Have Unknowingly Been Using My GF's (27F) Ex's Molded Dildo to Get Her Off,"Previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/a4cky3/i\_27m\_have\_unknowingly\_been\_using\_my\_gfs\_27f\_exs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a4cky3/i_27m_have_unknowingly_been_using_my_gfs_27f_exs/)

So, we had the talk. My relationship is over. After some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late Saturday, I brought it up. She again tried to deflect and change the subject, but I demanded we stay on topic. I told her outright how I felt, how I thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. She tried to play it off like I was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. Then she spun it into a penis size issue. I kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her Ex-BF and NOT the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. I told her I wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and I was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

The conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say I have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. I knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so I outright told her the relationship was over.

Thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. They were helpful and confirmed my feelings. Now I guess I will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. I'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

AITA for getting annoyed with parents who drive their kids to affluent neighbors on Halloween?,"Within the past year, my girlfriend moved in with me into my home in an affluent neighborhood. For the past few years, the neighbors and I have seen a growing amount of people come to our neighborhood for Halloween. This has caused a lot of people to ""turn off"" for Halloween, which you'd think would get the crowd to lessen but it keeps growing. I was openly annoyed with this leading up to Halloween and my girlfriend would condemn it every time I brought it up because ""Halloween's all about sharing"", saying it shouldn't matter whether the kids are from the neighborhood or not. She'd also point out that many of these children probably live in bad neighborhoods where it's not possible to trick-or-treat. Not surprisingly, this year at both entrances to the neighborhood, cars line the streets.. some with out of state plates (I live in a suburb of a city which is just over the state line.)

TIFU by getting so high I thought I predicted my own death,"This happened last night in a 420-legal state, so no laws were broken in the making of this TIFU. Burner because reasons.

After taking a break from smoking for a few months, I decided to break out an indica-hybrid vape cartridge I bought a while ago and let the good times roll. I've been hitting it the past few days, and each time I get higher than a kite because my tolerance is so low now and I don't know when to stop hitting it.

I was on Facebook yesterday morning when I was sober, and in one of my meme groups saw a screenshot of a post about a 23-year-old college student who died after eating pasta that had been left out five days. The top comment on it was ""he pasta way,"" and that just stuck with me because it was so funny.

Later that night, I was cleaning out my fridge and came across two containers of food I had brought back with me from home (I'm a college senior and the semester started two weeks ago). One of the containers was a tortellini salad, and I noticed it had a ""sell by"" date of four days before. I was about to throw it out, then decided to smell it and try a piece given the proximity of the sell by date. I had one piece of tortellini, decided it might be alright, and put it back to figure it out later.

A few hours later, the high times have come and I'm hitting my vape pen. After watching a Rodney Dangerfield classic, I go up to bed and am lying there when all of a sudden I start feeling a sense of doom. I start imagining every hypochondriac symptom in the book, from chest pain, to stomach pain, to shortness of breath, etc. 

At the same time, all I could see in my head was ""he pasta way"" and started thinking that I was an almost 23-year-old college senior and I ate pasta that was approximately five days expired. I suddenly realized that I never saw the guy's name or where it happened in the screenshot, and started freaking out thinking it was about me. Shortly thereafter the EMT side of me takes over, checks that I have a pulse when I've pretty much convinced myself my heart has stopped, and I basically run an out-of-body patient assessment on myself to make sure I'm alive. I fell asleep, and just woke up after 12 hours.

AITA for blaming my 14yo sister's pregnancy on my parents?,"  

I am a teenage girl living in Italy with extremely religious parents, and a now 26 week pregnant 14 year old sister.

My parents raised us with no knowledge of sex, and did everything they could to ensure that we couldn't learn about sex in school (such as removing us from school in days sex education was performed, and going as far as to remove me from class whenever I had biology in my later school years in case I got any ideas), and they never told us about it either. We were always taught that sex is for married couples who want to have children, and so the only real knowledge of sex I had was from my friends and media.

My parents think I am still a virgin despite being with my current boyfriend for two years, but this is not true. As they never found out about me having sex, I suppose my parents assumed their methods worked. However, last year, my sister (who is much braver than I was) came home to my parents and said she had a boyfriend. They got extremely angry, but knowing they couldn't really stop her seeing him without pulling her out of that school, accepted it somewhat.

My sister's boyfriend does not come from a religious background. I know his family well as I am friends with his older sister and they are very liberal.

My little sister and I share a room, and long story short, I found condoms in her pocket when I was tidying her clothes up. I asked her about it, and she told me they had been having sex for months with the condoms. I'm still pretty uneducated on sex due to my upbringing, but I have also been using condoms only for years so I - perhaps stupidly - assumed she would be fine and decided not to tell my parents. She is of age here and he is a nice boy, so I assumed it was fine.

This was a while ago, and I recently came home to a huge argument going on in my house. My parents had found out that my little sister is pregnant, and she has somehow been hiding it for all this time. My parents were going crazy at her, making her cry and simultaneously telling her she is stupid for getting pregnant but also that giving away the baby be wrong. My mother also claimed that an abortion would never be an option, to which my sister said she was too far along anyway. As far as I am aware, abortions are not permitted after the first trimester. At this point, my mother changed her mind and decided that my sister absolutely should have had an abortion. It was a huge mess in which I mainly stood aside. My mother eventually asked my opinion, and I replied:

""I think it's entirely your fault she is pregnant, you actively prevented her from knowing how to have safe sex and ultimately this child should be your responsibility, you have failed her and are abusing her for it.""

My whole family are now angry at me, and along with this I shared that I had sex at her age and the way they raised us made us deceitful. Now everyone is angry at each other apart from me and my sister, and I can't help feeling like my input made it worse.",AmItheAsshole

AITA [25] for telling my sister [19] that being a stay at home mom isn't a career plan?,"My sister has never put much thought into how she's going to afford to be alive. She doesn't have ambition.  
 
Ever since she was little, when asked what she wants to be, she'd jokingly answer that her plan is to be a stay at home mom. She's still saying it, but now she isn't joking.  
 
She doesn't even have that much experience with kids! She's never baby sat. 
 
Recently she's been telling family members she's going to nursing school which is amazing! I wanted to talk to about it and praise her.
 
I visited home last weekend (she still lives with my parents) and asked her what her plans are — in a sisterly way not in a ""this is a setup to lecture you way"". She said she's been lying to the the family and that she plans to keep working her minimum wage job until she meets a man she wants to settle down with. From there the conversation went like this: 
 
Me (irritated): there are no Prince Charming in real life, Rosie 
 
Rosie (irritates): yea ... I know ... I'm not looking for a Prince Charming. I want to find a man to raise up.
 
Me: but you are. You want someone to come take over your life because you don't have the motivation to do better on your own. If your whole life's goal is to find a man to love you, it's going to push you into the arms of the wrong kind of man. Also, how are you gonna ""raise up"" a man if you can't even raise yourself up? Do you want to be like mom? 
 
Rosie: no! I'm not going to be like mom! I'm going to do it better! I saw what she did and now I can do better! 
 
Me: well do better but improving yourself before you get knocked up. You don't remember but from 8 until 13 I watched you and (brother) every night while mom partied until 3 because she got pregnant too early, didn't have time for herself, and resented us. That's going to be you.  
 
My sister was crying at this point said fuck you, and left. 
 
My dad overheard and said I was too rough and she didn't need to hear all that. 
 
I think I was justified. Sometimes you have to be mean to get things through a person's head.

My Husband Knocked Up His Mistress,"Hey there, Reddit. Throwaway here.

My husband impregnated his mistress. She had the baby. She got a paternity test. It's his. 

The baby is a few months old.
She wants child support. 

How do I know this? She showed up on our doorstep with said baby and paternity results. 
I had no clue that he was having an affair, his affair partner was having a baby, or that he was present for birth and funneling her money from ""our"" savings. 

He is a stay-at-home dad to our two young children. I am the sole earner. 
If I don't immediately file for an at fault divorce (In Virginia), will I be responsible for paying for this child?

This is all very fresh and I'm on my phone- so sorry for formatting/grammar/content.

I'm going to consult an attorney next week, just looking for some unofficial answer so I can survive the weekend with my sanity intact. 

Edit: 
The reason I'm pretty sure it's a legit paternity test is that she has filed for support. 
And, oh yes. I plan to file asap and I'm meeting with my attorney Monday.

I've spent several hours plugging in numbers to the VA child support calculator. Even of I impute him a reasonable wage, I will owe him child support. Even if I have 80% custody, I will owe him child support. 
Even if he waives alimony, he will likely get a bunch from accounts/retirement/property unless he just walks away. 

He wants to ""make us work"", so I expect this is going to go downhill quickly. 

Thanks everyone for the advice. Pretty sure I'm fucked no matter what. The thought of having to (even temporarily) finance his ""other child"" was feeling like the proverbial straw...

She gets points for having the balls to walk up and hand deliver a giant envelope of destruction, personally. I also hope she keeps him. She can fucking have him.",legaladvice

UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.


Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

TIFU a marriage," Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

 So I sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. I live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... So common that I sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 One particular day I dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that I had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. So as we arrive I mention this to the rider:

Me - Hey I just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

Rider- No, must be the wrong house

Me- Nope, he walked right out of that side door. I dropped him off at *names local bar* His girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (I had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) You guys having a family/friend vacation?

Rider- This is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. Nobody lives here but me and my wife and I've been in NY for work for the past 4 days.

TIFU By getting into my boyfriends car.,"Obligatory this didn't happen today but rather about 4 years ago (I have a reason for saying that so calm your tits).

My (then) boyfriend (now husband) and I went to Orlando a few years ago (in October actually) for a surprise/engagement trip. We ended up taking his mom's white Chevy Volt since it was better on gas than our vehicles. At the time, I was working at a bank (just started actually) and had the sweetest co-worker ever. Super young, very religious, parents were die hard Pentecostal people. Anyway, my boyfriend still had his moms white car, as he was going to swap out vehicles the next day. He was picking me up from work, he had texted me a few minutes earlier to let me know that he would be there soon. We had a big window at the top of the staircase that looked out to the parking lot and when I saw a white car pull up, I high tailed it down the stairs so we could go home. I run across the lot, fling the door open and hop in. Much to my dismay, the driver is *not* my sweet boyfriend, no. Instead, she's an older lady who I had never met so I did the only logical thing I could think of, which was to scream ""WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?"" at the absolute top of my lungs at. Then I realized, this is *not the volt*, I jumped into someone else's car and screamed at them. I jumped out and ran back across the parking lot, back into the bank and called my boyfriend and asked where the hell he was. 

Next day at work, my co-worker pulls me aside to ask if I might have possibly screamed at her mother the night before. Whoops. 

TL;DR Got into the wrong car and screamed profanities at an older lady.

Addition** Yes, I know the title is sort of misleading. I genuinely assumed I was getting into his car, obviously I was not, but that's why I named it that. It was a little more catchy than ""TIFU by getting in the wrong car"". For those of you who are getting pissed and commenting ""click bait"", just call me Buzzfeed and move tf on. 

** for those of you who think I'm an asshole.  Yes, yes I am an asshole. But this was a legitimate mistake. I know I startled her, but I panicked and ran out. No I did not go back and apologize because I was too embarrassed. My co worker and I had a fine relationship afterwards so there were no hard feelings left over. She teased me about it a few times. 

** This was 4 years ago. I cannot go back and apologize to the lady or my coworker. I no longer work there and I lost touch with her after she got married and quit. I don't even know what her last name is to reconnect with her on social media. ",tifu

Recently, however, every few times she mentions it, I'll bring up her spending habits. In the time we've been together, she's spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

The last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she'd need to save to get started. 

After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it's never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

She's called me TA, that I'm trying to control her money, I'm trying to humiliate her, make her feel ""small"" and it's none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing

Friends [women in their 20s] think my brother [35/M] is a bad choice""","[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/)

&#x200B;

I am so thankful for all of your comments - I read every single one of them! 

&#x200B;

So, what happened? Well, I realized that it is my wedding. My fiance fully understood my position and really likes my brother and thought it was a great idea. I organized a brunch with my current bridesmaids to explain my position and why I did what I did. I realized that it's a story I've told but didn't talk about with my friends, I thought it was abundantly clear that being 'different' from my family made it obvious. 

&#x200B;

The brunch was interesting. What I didn't mention in my last post was that the person who raised the most fuss was also someone who seemed to get the other people going more than they otherwise would have. We met for a lovely brunch at a nice place (my treat, too!) and I raised the issue once more. The person who was most ""disgusted"" by it, ""Ms. X"" again raised her objection. She was furious and said that this was a travesty and tried to rally the other girls. This time, there wasn't as much of a reaction and the others sort of just didn't care. I told them all why I wanted to honor my brother and why it was so important to me and Ms. X admitted that it was lovely and touching but it should be her because *it's her business!* Turns out that she wanted to be MoH and was going behind my back to get the other girls to drop-out of contention so that she could do it so she could plan the wedding and thus could be MoH/Wedding Planner and this would be for her business. I was a bit... surprised. Ms. X was so upset that she threatened to drop out of the bridal party altogether if this went further. Brunch was tense after she left but the consensus was, the other girls wanted her gone and I didn't want her around anymore either, so she's no longer being included (I will send her an invite). 

&#x200B;

That meant I had to speak to my brother. As I mentioned he's a doctor and has a dual practice, so I swung by his office and texted him that I really needed to talk. He misinterpreted my comments so he kept the office open late and his secretary/nurse/wife let me in. I went into his office and he was immediately worried I was sick, but I told him what had happened and why Ms. X dropped out and that I wanted him to be my ""Man of Honor"". He was totally surprised and confused. He asked if I was sure and that I really shouldn't feel compelled which is when I began crying (I had so much pent up emotion) so he made me laugh which meant I was snorting-laugh-crying which is my usual. He said he would be delighted but wasn't really good at bridal showers so he would need help. 

&#x200B;

We arranged a time for all the bridesmaids to come together and meet the Man of Honor so we are having a BBQ at my parent's place this weekend. My mom and dad are so happy that he's involved - my dad is walking me down the aisle and my brother will stand at the end. My brother offered a very VERY generous gift towards paying for the wedding so not only is he standing as the MoH but is paying about 1/3 of the wedding. We're really, really excited. 

&#x200B;

Interesting story: One of the bridesmaids actually knows my brother - this bridesmaid and I were friends at college and lived away for a while. While visiting home she developed some sort of nasty infection and was directed from a walk-in clinic to an emergency room where my brother attended to her and got her on her way. So there's a weird personal connection that they can talk about when they meet ""Hey, you lanced something somewhere! Glad to meet you again!""

Friends is an overrated show and shouldn't have been kept on Netflix at the cost of increased subscription payments,"Although friends is considered to be loved by ""everyone"", it has been blown out of proportion by fans claiming it to be the best thing on tv forever and always. I don't think that people who only have Netflix to watch friends, or people that say they will cancel their subscription if its removed are serious. Just buy the box set for friends and for a single price, why keep paying a monthly subscription to just watch a single show? Netflix has paid around $100 million for the show to stream throughout 2019, and the payment before that was $30 million according to New York Times. That money could've been spent getting more recent shows and movies that people want or enjoyed to continue to stream on the service for more that 6 months in some instances. 

Tl;dr: Netflix should stop wasting money on friends and focus on newer shows",unpopularopinion
AITA for passively tormenting an entitled child?,"My wife and I are vacationing at the beach. We walked into a crab shack style restaurant today right on the beach to get some of that sweet sweet seafood. While we were waiting to be served after being seated a family was seated next to us. It was a grandma, grandpa, and grandson. Grandson was around 7-8 years old and was immediately crying and yelling at ear piercing volume at the grandparents about how he ""told them that he didn't want to eat here!"" and ""didn't even want to come to the beach!"" The doting grandmother was trying to console him and was basically serving as a whipping post. The grandfather was silently eating and not engaging.

At first we ignored him as best we could, but he got progressively louder and louder and was frankly ruining our lunch. I was wearing prescription sunglasses indoors because I left my glasses at our chair by accident and I needed them to see. I was looking at the drink menu that was in this small plastic stand on our table, and as I was the little kid loudly started accusing me of staring at him. Grandma politely asked me not to stare at him, and when I explained that I was reading the menu, she tried to explain to the kid in a ""see, it was just a misunderstanding"" type of way. The kid was having none of it and proceeded to accuse me of looking at him again about 5 minutes later.

Once he started accusing me of staring at him the second time. I started actually staring at him, and when he would have an outburst I would just move my gaze slightly somewhere else and play dumb. I'm sure it was obvious what I was doing, but it was amusing, and it was tormenting this entitled turd. At one point, when grandma went to the bathroom and grandpa was still I engaged, the kid just turned in his seat and puffed up aggressively and said ""I'm not going to tell you to stop staring at me again!"" When he did that, I slid my sunglasses down my nose, winked at him over my glasses, and slid them back up, at which point he had a massive meltdown and asked his grandpa to make me stop. 

In a solid and loud outburst Grandpa slammed his fist down on the table and unloaded on the kid about how he had done nothing but bitch for the last 3 hours, stood up, grabbed the kid by the collar and walked him up to the hostess and paid for their meal. Grandma came out of the bathroom shortly after and saw that they were leaving so she left with them. 

My wife was angry that I had fucked with a little kid, despite his behavior. I defended myself, but she says that I wasn't THE asshole, but I was AN asshole. I maintain that I wasn't the asshole, though I did inadvertently ruin the lunch of the old folks he was with by spooling him up more than he already was. We're at an impasse, what's your verdict Reddit?

Edit: my first gold! Holy shit, thanks Reddit.

AND a platinum?! Awesome!

Now a silver in the mix? Awesome! Thanks Reddit.

Also, some mid-vote reflection. Don't have long, we're still on vacation so I'm updating this during my morning routine. One of the biggest lessons I've learned from this AITA is to not gloss over details, because the premise of one of the points I've heard a lot here is based on some things I was definitely not clear on. That's my bad, and I should have been more clear. Hindsight is 20/20, but you live and learn. Just to clarify a few points: 

While the kid was crying at the beginning when he came in, that was short lived, and was over well before I came into the picture. When I said things like ""meltdown"", they didn't involve tears, but anger and yelling. He was pounding his fists on the table, doing that exaggerated hand fold exhale, and yelling/screaming at his grandma. I wasn't sitting there reducing a child to a blubbering heap of tears and anguish, that would be horrifying and heartbreaking. Poking a very frustrated bear of a kid? Sure. Childishly making someone as uncomfortable as they were making everyone else? Absolutely. Torturing a helpless child into a lifetime of scars and fear? Hardly. That's partially my fault for using words like ""torment"". It was hyperbole and set the wrong tone. 

Also, when I said, ""...accusing me of staring at him the second time. I started actually staring at him..."" I should have been more clear. I didn't just sit there and stare at a scared child who was just hoping the scary man would go away. I was eating lunch with my wife, she was my main focus. What was happening was the kid started to alternate between fixating on me and trying to get his grandma to do something or give him something. There were a lot of times over that two hours that he would stare at me and I either wouldn't notice because I was talking to my wife or I ignored it. Only periodically would I meet his gaze for 10 seconds or so, and then he would have another outburst about how I was looking at him. I'm not trying to change votes or defend myself, I just wanted to clarify on a misconception I'm seeing a lot in comments, and even more in personal messages. 

The other point I should have been more clear on is the timescale in question. From being seated at our table to the other group getting up and leaving was less than 3 hours but more than 2.

Final edit:

Well it appears I have been labeled the asshole. I stand by what I did, but accept the verdict. Many people voted YTA in a supporting manner, so I take it as a win all the same and feel some vindication.

Some lessons were learned. From what I experienced, I do not believe in the slightest that the kid had anything mentally wrong with him, he was just being a brat. That being said, the thought never crossed my mind during the encounter. I'd obviously never dream of taunting or negatively interacting with someone who was autistic. But, again, I have no reason to believe that he was.

Also, should I ever find myself in another AITA situation, I'll be sure to be as thorough in the description of the situation as possible. I think the outcome of the vote would have been different had I been more precise with my wording and less hyperbolic in my tone. 

Thank you for the gold and platinum redditors, and the supportive messages. To those people who sent messages threatening to harm me, please stop. I'm not interested in your 10 point plan to ""get me"". Remember the words of wisdom from the AITA rules, one interaction does not an asshole make. We are all the asshole at some point.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting a boy play my gaming system because his father wouldn't let his daughter play?,"Edit: Spelling and grammar.

I was on a considerably empty flight. It was a 4 seat row plane, with 2 seats on each side. There was a family of 4 sitting near me, mom, dad, daughter and son that moved around quite a bit as there were many available seats to move about in and the kids (my guess girl was 8-9, boy told me he was 6) were for moving around but for the most part behaving. 

After take off, I took out my switch to pass the time and caught the little boys attention. He started asking questions, and I got the nod of approval from the dad so I started showing him BOTW gameplay. We still had about an hour of fly time, so I figured, why not, I'll let them play Mario Party. 

I asked the dad(he was closest to me) if it would be alright if they played a game. He seemed happy with the idea, until I handed one of the two controllers I had to his daughter. He said something to her in a different language I didn't understand, she fussed a little and then handed me back the controller saying she ""can't play"". It doesn't take much to put 2 and 2 together. 

I didn't want to defy her fathers wishes or make a scene, but I couldn't help ask why she couldn't play, hoping I was wrong. 

""Girls shouldn't play video games"", his face and tone so matter of factly. 

He said this to me, a 27 year old woman, and I admit I got upset, but I couldn't argue. I just told him that if she couldn't play, I wouldn't let his son play either. This is when things went really south. 

The son, of course got upset and started to cry a bit. The dad started raising his voice at me, and the daughter was trying to assure me it was ok, even though she was clearly sad. The wife tried calming her husband and kids, but she wasn't getting anywhere.

I collected my controller from the son, and it hurt to pull away, but it just wasn't fair. I hated upsetting him, but as a girl who was once also told video games were boy only, I wasn't comfortable with that rule apply to my system. 

We were near the back, so a flight attendant came around to check what was going on, and the dad went into a tirade about how I purposely dangled the video game in front of his kids then changed my mind to be cruel. I couldn't really explain myself, I just said I couldn't let him play if the sister wasn't allowed too. The flight attendant just looked at the father and said I didn't have to share if I didn't want to since it was my system, and he started ranting in another language. 

I asked to move, and he said yes as it was fairly empty flight. I moved to the front, but at this point all the passengers had turn to look at us, the now two crying kids and the angry father. 

It been bothering me since it happened and I'm wondering if I should have just let the boy play. It wasn't his fault his father set those rules, and I really tore me up having to pull the controller away from him.

AITA for not finding a better solution? Or for offering in the first place? What should I have done?


Edit: I came to this subreddit because I felt/feel incredibly guilty. I made a very impulsive decision based on my feelings and didn't consider the feelings of the boy until after I'd changed seats. I was embarrassed because no one in the plane had really started paying attention until after both kids had started crying and the father was making a fuss. During the rest of the flight I kept thinking that if I had just played with the boy, and instead of upsetting the entire family and myself, it would have only been one person, not to mention the scene would have been avoided. I was embarrassed and mortified the flight attendant had to come over. Flights are tough on everyone and I definitely created waves, plus who doesn't feel guilty after making little kids cry? I'd been torn about whether I did the best I could do or if I could have done something better. There's no way I'll make any impact on the girls life, but I also ruined the flight for the family. Regardless, I'll probably forever remember this day as one of my least favourites, it's been a battle just trying to get over it.",AmItheAsshole

The answers were right along the lines of what I was thinking and gave me the confidence to go to my employer and demand payment.  I was a little worried about retribution, but I figured the law was on my side so wth?

Not only did they cut me a check, but 7 other employees who were affected like this were paid as well.  No signs of retribution either.  It turned out (at least this is what I'm being told, so who really knows?) that the HR manager misinterpreted the law.  Once this person read it again, they started to have doubts themselves, then contacted our corporate lawyers who told the HR manager that we must be paid.

TIFU by vomiting down my managers neck.,"I've felt quite awful about this lie and I needed a place to say this. This past Friday, my office was in a meeting. Our internal meeting room is designed to fit as many people in there as possible as we recently hired a bunch of people and the room is too small. So we sit in rows of seats with no desks in front of us, sort of like a school bus I suppose. 

My boss is sitting directly in front of me and with this specific meeting, the back row (where I sat) was empty except from me. Our CTO is the one holding the meeting so we are all seated listening.

I was rushed into the meeting and was unable to take my routine morning shit beforehand. As I sit behind my boss, I tried slipping out a silent fart because my stomach began to ache from the huge McDonalds breakfast I ate. 

About 10 minutes passed and I felt something in my boxers touching my inner leg as my brain completely omitted the fart from earlier. I instinctively think I sat in something so I slide my hand in my boxers, only concerned with being discrete. 

My next idiotic, instinctive move after removing my hand was to sniff it. Well it was immediately known that I now had shit on my fingers and just inhaled its' smell directly.

This caused me to instantly gag and that too, wasn't just gas. I projectile vomited my pancake breakfast up and it slathered my bosses neck, running down the inside of his collared shirt.

I instantly ran out of the room to the bathroom to wash my hand and clean myself up. I returned to the office and apologized endlessly and blamed it on my McDonalds breakfast and lied saying that it must've been undercooked sausage. 

I got the day off and he actually wished me well, unknowing if the fact I actually threw up on him because my vile self sniffed my own shit.

TL/DR: I unknowingly wiped a wet fart with my hand, sniffed it, and threw up on my bosses neck only to be given the day off and wished well.",tifu
WIBTA if I decline my twin stepdaughter's request to adopt her?,"Wife and I got married as widowers. My late wife and daughter passed away in an accident. My daughter was only 1 when she passed away. My current wife had 3 yo twins when we got married. The girls are 15 now.

TIFU - my daughter busted me on 4/20,"I was on our deck last night enjoying a joint.  I usually vape at night because it's discreet and there's no smell. I have 2 kids 14 & 17 and they have no idea I partake.  Being 420 and not smoking a joint since summer,  it was a beautiful spring evening so I decided to treat myself.

I heard my neighbour come outside to let her dogs out.  My neighbour doesn't know I smoke and not sure I want her to.  I quickly snuffed out my joint, hid it in my hand with intent to flush it, and came in the house.  

I walked into the the house and my 14yr old daughter was standing in the kitchen.  ""Oh THERE you are"".  Unbeknownst to me, the joint was still a little bit lit and she totally smelled the weed.

Well.... needless to say I was busted and we totally reversed roles.

We had an honest talk about it.  I do use because of my knee pain and I accentuated the benefits it has for that, but I feel like I let her down and am not the example I ought to be. 

She's very mature for a 14yr old and did say she feels more comfortable to come to me about stuff now that she knows I'm not uptight about weed.

AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?,"I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn't want her boys to see it. 

Now it's not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I'm back she's started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I'm living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn't a random house I've moved back into. I've lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

TIFU by locking myself INSIDE my hotel room.,"So i'm currently backpacking through the middle east and i'm currently in Egypt. Dahab to be exact. 

Being a poor backpacker i lashed out and booked the cheapest hotel i could which was about 100 EGP equally roughly 8 bucks (AUD cause thats where i'm from) which is like $6 USD so you don't complain. 

Place is fine (for $8) i get to my room and there is a massive crack in one of the small windows which is missing a big piece roughly a quarter the size of the window pane. 

Fair enough shit hotel but you get what you paid for. 

I was worried about bugs, but the guy showing me to my room simple grabbed a pillow and covered the window and fit perfectly, easy fix.

Now remember that for later. 

When i was first shown to my room the lock was a bit fiddly and you had basically turn the key and then bang into the door with your shoulder to open the thing, not my opinion literally what the guy did when he showed me the room. Whatever 8$ room. 

I leave the window on the opposite end of the room open to get a bit of airflow cause its fucking 30 degrees all day all night cause its fucking egypt, but it gets a nice breeze being by the seaside. 

I go about my day and when i retire to my room getting ready for bed i put my key in, turn it, bang the door open, all sweet and the then breeze from the window i opened before shuts the door behind me after i walk in.  

So i fuck around getting undressed grab my toothbrush about to hit the showers and realise i cant find my key, all good probably chucked it on somewhere in my stuff when i walked in like i usually do, turn the place upside down looking for this little bastard and its no where to be found and then i realise.

The. Fucking. Door. 

That's right, the wind blew my door shut with the key in the fucking door. Now you're thinking no biggie dickhead open the door and you'd be right, if i wasn't in a fucking 8 dollar hotel room in egypt. 

I now discover THERE IS NO FUCKING DOOR HANDLE ON THE INSIDE. you use the key to open and close the door both ways. 

Now im in panic mode, cause i cant confirm the key is in the fucking door and I cant look out the window cause the hole isnt big enough and the other windows have fly screens. So i turn the room upside down again looking for the key. Nothing. 

Attempt 1:

Where the door handle is missing theres a square hole where the door handle should be so being the Mac Guyver i am i jam the butt of my wooden toothbrush (save the planet man) into the square hole and almost get it all the way before the wood is rounded and snaps in the hole. Fuck.

Attempt 2:

To confirm the key is in the door before i call for help or smash a window, i try and take a picture of the door by sticking my hand out the window with my phone. No luck. 

Now in FULL PANIC MODE I look at the broken pane and realise this piece of shit ins't even held in a frame its been cut size and is held by small nails around the edges. Fuck. Yes. 

Attempt 3:

So i grab my trusty toothbrush (the only thing i had close to a tool in my arsenal) and start bending all this nails flat against the frame and because of the missing piece I'm able to pull it out with ease. Fuck. Yes. 

Now i am not a portly gentleman, nor am i a rake, but this window was not made for men to climb through. But If theres a will, theres a way. 

With the use of a table and the little upper body strength i possess i was able to pull my fat ass through the fucking window, getting a small blood blister on my hand while doing so. 

And there is my key laughing at me in the fucking keyhole of my locked oneway door. 

Needless to say i have not let it out of my sight since, and i was able to bend the nails back in place to hold the window pane again. 

God bless that broken window and God bless my fucking toothbrush. 

There you go reddit theres my embarrassing story of how i locked myself inside my hotel room.  

TLDR; the wind blew my door shut with my key on the outside in a shitty hotel room with no handle on the inside, i use a tooth brush to pry a window out of its frame to get my key and get back into the room.

If you're literate and have a functioning stove, oven, or any other appliance, you CAN cook, you just dont want to read and follow instructions on how to cook a decent meal.

Edit 1 bc I incorrectly and hastily used the word learn. It really is laziness

Edit 2 bc I'm learning after posting this that its REALLY not all that unpopular

[F23] Found out that my [M29] boyfriend only settled for me and is not really attracted to me.,"Saw his text messages open and I did pry and when I catched a glimpse of ""break up with her"" (his friend wrote that), I couldn't help but read the entire conversation.

My boyfriend, who is 29, and has been with me for a year, is my first relationship and I'm his first as well. The difference between us, he's been looking for a girlfriend all through his 20s, while I wasn't too bothered/didn't care for guys much. (Busy with college, not much interest, not much need). 

He literally wrote to his friend that he trapped in the relationship. That he wishes he could just hook up and flirt with other girls but he also wrote he always gets rejected and has no chance.

Then he wrote how he would like to be with ""hot girls"" or even just date a hot girl and how he feels like he settled for an average girl.

I am insanely mad.

Honestly, being realistic, I'm a bit above average (My face is about 70th percentile realistically speaking and my body is quite fit/skinny), whereas, as sexy as I find him, is a bit unconventional looking/overweight. Probably average guy by US standards, but he is, (Not in my eyes!), not someone who should complain.

Although, I do believe everyone has the right to be with who they are attracted to. I like chunky guys, others do not. So I don't get why he is with me when I'm not attractive to him and I'm just straight up disappointed.

Besides, his need for hook ups - I don't get it. I'm more enthusiastic about sex than he is, I initiate it, and I would have it more often if he were willing to. 

What made me lose my sh*t is that he thinks he only ""settled"" for me.

I get the impression he's only with me so he won't die alone.

My (M25) new girlfriend (22F) just told me she sleeps with her best friend. Now I am conflicted.,"I've been seeing this girl for just about a month, and we came together in a random but beautiful way. I've grown quite fond of her, and her dog as well. Just last week, after meeting her friends, we had ""the talk"" and decided we would pursue a relationship with one another.

Due to her work schedule,  she has 2 weeks off upcoming. I asked her how she planned to spend these weeks, and she revealed she will travel to her old college town about 3 hours away to meet her school friend. When I asked if I had met this friend before in the bar, she replied that this male friend is her best friend. He ""saved her life"" when she was depressed in college, and is an important person for her. Sure, no problem I thought. Then she revealed she always has sex with him when she visits. 

I was shocked and played it off, and only waited until one day later to talk to her about it again. She doesn't see this guy but once a year, and is adamant that there are no romantic feelings there. I get a seriously weird vibe from this: Guy helped you when you tried to kill yourself, so now you owe (or give) him sex? Wtf. 

She says this is something I have to accept, but I wanted to have a good think before I make any decision. I really care for her and her little doggo, but this situation makes my stomach uneasy. 

Has anyone experienced this before? 

Edit 1: I went to her on her lunch break, and laid out how I really feel about this. How bullshit it is that she wants to have her cake and eat it too. I'm not forcing her to cut off contact with the guy who ""saved"" her, but she cant be fooling around with him and keep me around. She was taken aback by how I came out verbally swinging. She'll gather herself and we'll talk again tonight. 

Ps info: few have asked whats up with the dog: i was viciously attacked by a dog as a youth, and her dog is the only dog i ever let close to me. We all even sleep in my bed 😇 hence the attachment to him. 

UPDATE: She stuck to her guns, I stuck to mine. I ended our relationship amicably, and she will swing by around later to get whatever she left here, and i will kiss the dog one last time.

Thank you all for your comments and concerns,  I'm feeling sad but life goes on. 🤘🏿",relationship_advice
"(From an American point of view) We are running out of real problems, so we make up stuff to be mad about.","From my own personal experience, I feel like society is really trying hard to find things to be upset about.

I'm sure everyone has their own experiences, but here's a little background on me.... I was born in the US, but my parents are immigrants from the Middle East.  I was born into the opposite of wealth, debt.  We didn't have much growing up.  Both my parents busted their ass, making a life for myself and my siblings.  I grew up in Chicago.  We didn't come from any money, and my parents were not educated.  They learned how to speak English, and just went from there.  My dad worked as an appliance repair man, and my mom worked in retail.  We had little to nothing, but they did their best insulating us from the always impending financial ruin we were on the brink of.  My siblings and I picked up on that, but we didn't want to add stress to them and played dumb.  They kept working hard, saving, and tried to instill in us the value of hard work and integrity, and that some day good will come of it.  At the end of the day, we (the kids) all turned out great.  We all own homes in good neighborhoods, have money saved up, and have decent work.... Most importantly we lead our lives with honesty and integrity.

So I feel like my family started from the bottom, and through sheer dedication we all made it.  While this was tough, it was not as tough as life is where they came from.  Especially today as we are Iraqi Christians (but that's a whole other story).

I'm 32.  I've got a great job (even though I never finished college, couldn't afford to keep going, and my ethnic background didn't get me anything in terms of scholarships or financial aid like some of my friends), I finally own a home, have no debt other than my mortgage, I've got a bit saved up for a rainy day, and a pretty decent amount in my 401k for someone my age.  All of my accomplishments, and my family's have been through discipline and sacrifice.  I didn't buy the nice car, I bought the used Honda.  I didn't buy the fancy clothes, I went to discount stores.  I didn't eat out, I cooked every night.  I lived well within my means.

To my point.  I really feel like a lot of what people are angry about, fighting over, or are offended by, is complete bullshit.  Why have people gotten so soft?  Every time I turn on the news, talk to friends or people at the office, there's a new artificial outrage that's sweeping across the country.  Are there people still struggling with poverty, addiction, abuse, etc? Absolutely.  But I think those yelling and complaining the most are coming from some kind of privilege, or they can change their path but refuse to so they can remain a victim.

Is it just me or are things actually kind of ok and not that bad?  I just think the whining and yelling (especially from my generation) is unwarranted.  If that energy was applied to bettering themselves, they may discover there is upward mobility here in the US.  Is it evenly distributed? No, but life isn't fair.",unpopularopinion
[NC] My dog went missing a month ago and i found her on Facebook. The family that has her refuses to return her to me. What can I do?,"So a little over a month ago my purebred yellow lab went missing from my backyard. At first I thought she might have escaped but after looking around it turned out someone broke into my backyard and took her. I made a police report but nothing ever came of it and she didn't turn up anywhere.

Last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. It was my dog. I should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

I called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. I told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation I all but confirmed it. Here's the problem, when I asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. Stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because I took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". I told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

I found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. I found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. She is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

I'm pissed right now and don't know what to do. That dog lived with me for over 5 years since she was a puppy and now because they've had her for three weeks they think they get to keep her. What can I do? I have all of the papers that prove I own her (dog licence, proof of ownership, medical records, etc) and she is chipped. I also have that police report. What do I need to do to get my dog back?",legaladvice
My (24M) gf (24F) is unusually buying new bras and panties,"Over the last two and half weeks my gf has bought close to 9 new pairs of lingerie. This is unusual because she bought some 7 new pairs somewhere at the beginning of April. Now I don't mind a girl buying new lingerie, but this is unusual - she had close to 40 new pairs of lingerie, a count which keeps on decreasing every other day. Now I take out trash every given day, and I've observed that she hasn't thrown her old lingerie in trash over past one week, while there's no trace of it anywhere in our apartment. And yet she is missing 4-5 pairs from our common closet. She seems to act pretty normal, there's no dent in her daily routine. But it boggles me why she is on this lingerie shopping spree? It's not like she is amassing a stockpile of lingerie, her lingerie count is somewhat unchanged from the time before this madness. I couldn't find trace of her old lingerie. Am I being paranoid? Am I missing something here feminine that's otherwise normal? Should I ask her anything about it?

TL;DR GF buying new lingerie every few days, while leaving no trace where she threw her old ones.

**UPDATE**: I might ask her while we drive down to the train station in next 30 minutes. Will keep you guys posted.

**UPDATE 2**: Alright I chatted with her while driving. I started off by asking her directly as u/fightmaxmaster suggested. She said something like she hasn't been feeling good about her underwear fitting (old and new) while at work. So she has taken a new vow - if she finds any underwear incredibly uncomfortable, she will throw it off immediately. I asked her I haven't noticed any in our trash (maintaining my casual tone) and she said since since we spend most our daytime at work she disposes it off in her workplace bin and carries pair of change underwear, like most women do. I even said to her jokingly ""Oh, I was worried you were seelling your undies on eBay or something"" (just to get some kind of an answer) and she ewwed my remark. **Do women do that at work or get rid off their old undies when they find it uncomfortable like this?** I could really use your insight on this. Tbh, we moved together at the beginning of this year and this is the first time I've moved in with a girl, in a relationship. I don't know what else I could do, since she has made it clear she drops it off in work trash and has shown no intention/fetish to sell it online. But overall, I tried to make this conversation as 'just out of curiosity' as I could.

**UPDATE 3**: This is way too overwhelming. I am heading back home and taking a day off. I know I might be overreacting but somehow it just doesn't sound right, the conversation we had an hour ago. Might talk to her again during her lunch break.

**UPDATE 4**: Seriously guys, thank you!! I have been glued to my phone all morning along, except driving back home. It took me a lot of self-convincing to gather clues for a possibility that my gf might be selling it online. Back at home, we have place to archive open mails, receipts, bills and other important documents except for our social and other personal items. There were 6 receipts in total, 2 from Victoria's Secret and 3 from Target and 1 from Macy's. Against my rough counting, she had amassed some 28-30 pairs of new lingerie, including the one at the beginning of April. Two of these receipts had Karen's name on it (my gf's elder sister), I believe Karen has some kind of rewards card from VS. That itself accounts for 40% of her new purchases. Till now I thought she had probably purchased 15 pairs, give or take. I don't wanna invade her privacy by sneaking her bank statements, because that would be a bit over the line. I cannot believe that she spent $1100+ on lingerie over past 45 days. That by itself is so fucking unusual. It's also odd that she hasn't paid using our RED card at Target (we have Target app on our phones). I am calling my brother over to get some clarity. I don't know if it would be right to login to her laptop and see her browsing history to confirm if she's selling her underwear online. I am just numbed atm.

**UPDATE 5**: I spoke to my brother and saw some of your comments. I've decided to confront her in-person when she's back home. I don't wanna take any chances or let any form of miscommunication trigger chain reactions for questions that might be unwarranted to her.

**UPDATE 6**: You know you have one of those days when all the hell breaks loose and this was one for me. I skipped lunch break phone call in hopes I can talk to my gf when she gets back home. Spoke to Karen and her mom in the meantime to ensure if she isn't in some kind of financial mess or other kind of trouble. But it takes one fucking truth to destroy it all. You guys, my gf saw this post at work and she immediately knew it was me posting it here. I didn't realize this, leaving rest of her day off. Some 4 hours ago my gf confessed that she was sleeping with some guy she met at her work gym. Since the beginning of March. Fuck me. 

She met this guy at her work gym some 8 months ago. This guy is not even from her workplace, he works at this other startup, in a different building of this corporate park. She said things got all heated up late February after one afternoon. I fucking though she stopped going to gym owing to her hectic schedule after her promotion late November. But there she was, going to gym all along. From the day she started sleeping with this guy, she told her coworkers she has switched gyms across the street. I haven't even cared to ask where they did it. The missing underwear: this is so messed up. Sick. She had this realization midway in March that this was wrong. I don't know why I never saw this side of her but she began buying new underwear and throwing it off **AS SOME FUCKING GUILT RITUAL**. She said she couldn't get off that guilt of wearing the same underwear in bed with me as she worn hours earlier sleeping with that mf. Do you know how disgusting that feels? Who fucking does this - throw underwear because you want tp dust off guilt from having it worn during sex with a guy you've met and barely known? I was stand still, but I held up for the moment. She says she was confused and that she has backed away from this guy's advances since past one week. I don't believe any word of it. In fact I don't think I wanna believe what she's said. Also, the ""tossing her underwear at workplace"" was an excuse - yes, because back then I was driving and she didn't know how to react or what to say, so she made that excuse up. And here I was worrying whole day what it could be.

I later called Karen because we were both emotionally drained. I didn't even wait a bit after she arrived. Even Karen was shocked by the ramble. She later called me, because I had already left them in our apartment. It took me a while to get my thinking right and call my brother. I'll be crashing at his house for now. 

Honestly I don't even wanna see her face ever. How can someone lie so perfectly? How can someone be so cold that they show no emotional change or discomfort when sleeping with two people??? WTF - she slept with me hours after she slept with that idiot? And throwing underwear was her means to get over that guilt. I don't understand her anymore. When she said it was all carnal, I didn't even know she believed in notion of sleeping around with people for physical needs. She said she still loves me and this was just something that made her feel good. I don't even know what to interpret of that. Honestly I think my thoughts are all over the place. But thank you - I don't know if I could have known about this if it wasn't for this post. It was after dinner did I realize that was trending on this sub, and this post made her take the mid-day train back home. I have so many questions. Part of me wants to see her again just to make sure she is alright. Part of me doesn't want to see her ever again. I have so many questions but I just avoided her by walking downstairs in no time. I had to ask my brother and his wife to pick some stuff off from home. Shit this is all messed up.

"Dear humans: Vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". It *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that. (Blame ice cream's history)","When you are served ice cream, you are served vanilla as the ""default"" ice cream. And it is white, a word often synonymous with ""blank"" or ""empty"". This made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. But it's not.

It really doesn't help that in the U.S., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""American cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.) Vanilla was once described in Europe as the ""essence and epitome of flavor"". That's why it became so common. And over time, vanilla was widely substituted with cheaper things. ""Natural vanilla flavor"" isn't vanilla. It's a natural flavor that tastes kinda like it (and often comes from something you don't want to hear about, not that I think there's anything wrong with substitute flavors in general). Real vanilla is fantastic.

Stop misrepresenting vanilla. It's a great flavor. (Although I know that software terms are already dooming ""vanilla"" to continue being thought of as ""boring"", and there's nothing I can do to fix that. As if ""vanilla Minecraft"" is even boring... Sigh.)",unpopularopinion

"LPT: When Arguing, Try Restating the Main Point's of the Other Person's Argument Back to Them and Have Them Do the Same with You","Believe it or not, the vast majority of Arguments are based on miscommunication.  

With arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.

1) Not understand the other person's argument

2)  Feeling that the other person does not understand your argument

3) Convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument

4)  Arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...

5) An unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument

...

Next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  

Something like, ""Hold on, I want to make sure I understand what you are arguing. You are saying that XYZ is broken and the only way to fix XYZ is to get QRS to modify Y so that it will fit better into Z?""

Now this has several benefits.  

--First and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.  This is huge because most arguments get so convoluted the people arguing don't even know what they are arguing about (and this goes double for emotional and relationship type arguments when the people have history together).  

--Secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect

--Thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually ""listen"" and ""hear"" what they are saying.

--Fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.

You can also do the reverse.  Pause the argument and ask ""Can you tell me what my argument is?  Can you explain the problem as I see it?

This forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    And again, it helps to actually help define the EXACT problem...",LifeProTips

"My boyfriend (21M) is well-off and travelling, while I'm (20F) broke, stuck in shit conditions and struggling to put food on my plate. It's making me feel pathetic and worthless, and it's getting increasingly difficult to be happy for him. Help?","We've been together for a year, been best friends for 3 years before that. My boyfriend comes from a wealthy family while mine has always been quite poor. I love him and care about him a lot and I have never been jealous of his wealth, I've always paid for my own things and haven't/don't expect him to pay for me.

However recently things have been especially tough for me, I live alone as I have no other options and am a student, due to certain circumstances (sick family member, debt and a few other things) life has been EXTREMELY difficult for me recently. I work when I'm not studying and come home late in the night, then rush to college in the morning, rince and repeat. Almost everything I earn goes to pay the rent and internet (which I need for college). Most of the days I have nothing to eat, and it won't be an exaggeration to say I mostly survive on bread, eggs and ramen noodles. I'm extremely tired, depressed and constantly have suicidal thoughts.

My boyfriend left 2 months ago to travel the EU and take language courses. He constantly sends me pictures of the things he's up to, cliché pics of expensive food, hotels, pools etc. I've always been very excited and happy for him when he's having a good time, but at the moment it's become too much to handle. I know it will probably sound shallow but I don't want to see pictures of him having steak with red wine and everything when my best meal in the last 6 months has been a chicken pie and most of the days I'm just starving.

He knows of my current situation and while I know he isn't trying to mock me, it often feels like it. It's like he's rubbing it in my face, although he isn't doing that deliberately. It still makes me angry at him. I can't keep up a conversation with him anymore because he always disappears mid-conversation and then comes back with a pic of him at a party or something titled ""sorry was afk"", and then disappears again. He makes me feel even more lonely than I already am. I love him but I'm constantly so mad and upset with him. It just hurts so much. I'm miserable and have no idea what to do. I'm losing the only friend and a person that loves me over these feelings and I don't know how to stop them.

There were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today.,"This came up while discussing movies with my sister. I asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. She said something like ""I'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good AND female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

The current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like Wonder Woman being exceptions). I found Terminator, Power Rangers, Castle, etc. way cooler when they made them EQUALS with men and not simply trash them. Also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? I remember when the chess player Judith Polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. Now, with a separate Chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. But I'm digressing.

Power Rangers vs the new Ghostbusters is my point. Females were part of the original PR team in almost equal numbers. They usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. That. Was. Awesome. The new Ghostbusters isn't. 

Now I'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? Twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

EDIT: To answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, I'm not making this up. Women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. Although this was challenged by Judit and now by Hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",unpopularopinion
My boyfriend has a crush on my best friend.,"Okay, guys, I don't even know where to start this whole day has been a whirlwind. I apologize as this is going to be a long one. Obligatory apology for formatting as I'm on mobile. 

Last night my on/off boyfriend came (uninvited) to the bar I was at with my friends. He was clearly coked out and half-in-the-bag. The first thing he said to me was ""let me know if anyone here touches you, I'm in a fighting mood."" ?! What. I'm just trying to have a good night with my friends, why did he feel the need to show up here? 

A couple hours later, after many alcoholic beverages, me and my best friend decided to go over to his house with his friends for a night cap. Stupid, I know. We ended up staying all night, I stayed over because I left my house keys in our DDs car and my friend, I'll call her Emilia, left late in the morning. 

In that time, him and Emilia had had ""life chats"" and he had spent most of his time ignoring me to talk to her. At one point when we were both washing our faces to take off the days' makeup, he told her she had perfect skin and it didn't even look like she took anything off, looked at me in the mirror, then followed her back into his room. I have struggled with acne for almost ten years. I'm twenty now. He knows I'm insecure about my skin. 

Anyways. After everyone else had gone home, I was left to take care of his drunk ass for hours until I finally just went out to the living room and fell asleep on the couch. I was rudely awakened moments later to him yelling on the phone, I asked him not once, twice, but three times to please talk in his room. He hung up and yelled at me saying I was keeping him from talking to his dad. ?! 

I got up and went back into his room and fell asleep. This time he woke me up telling me he needed to say something. ""Look at me, *look* at me!"" Then he tells me that he has a crush on Emilia, keep in mind this is their first time ever hanging out, and that she is the only person who's ever listened to him or connected with him in that way. 

I can't stress enough how much I have done for this dude. We have been on and off for **THREE** years. I have stayed up all night with him during his coke binges and supported him through trying to get clean, listened to his endless rants, gave him a place to stay when he didn't have one, driven him to and from work for months when he didn't have a running vehicle, used my CAA when his vehicles have broken down, picked him up in the middle of the night..... the list goes on and on. But I apparently have never listened to him or connected with him like Emilia has. 

Earlier this evening she texted me saying she hadn't even opened his [message](https://imgur.com/a/zKlRFTU), I didn't even know he had messaged her. I honestly don't even know what to say about it, I'm kind of just baffled that three years of being together and all the time I've spent taking care of him has been all for not. That he can just throw it all away because he has a drunk crush on my *best* friend. 

Here is the part where I ask you, dear redditors, for advice. What do I do? I've already broken up with him, blocked him on everything (then unblocked to tell him to get off my netflix), me and Emilia will remain friends of course but, how do I cope with the fact that the person I thought would always have my back, dropped me for her? How do I keep myself from resenting her for it? She is one of my favourite people in this world, I know that this is 100% not her fault, I just don't want my emotions to take a toll on our friendship. Lastly, what is the best way to move on? Please share any stories you think would help or make me feel better. 

If you actually read this whole rant, thank you so, so kindly.

Edit: He was not an addict when we started dating, the coke habit he picked up afterwards. I just didn't want to see him choose that path for himself and thought that I could help him, which I know now is beyond me.

Edit 2: Holy smokes. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to read this and share your thoughts. I'm so sorry I can't reply to you all but I promise I am listening and share many of your opinions. I appreciate everything you have to say whether it is tough-love or no-love. 

To clarify some things: I dumped him! I am NOT mad at Emilia, was just looking for advice so that I don't shift blame. We WERE dating when this happened and that is why I went to his house, when we were off we were VLC. Emilia and I became friends last year through work and have lived in different cities the entirety of our friendship which is why they'd never hung out.

Edit 3: Here is my chance to PROFIT. Please send me your pet pictures!!! I need as many smiles as I can get and your sweet fluffy babies will bring me almost as much joy as they do you💗

Can my ex wife make me take a breathalyzer at her will? Not court ordered. Texas.,"My wife (28) and I(28) got a divorce about 4 months ago. It was uncontested. I gave her the house and custody. My visitations are every Thursday and 1rst,3rd and 5th weekend (yay texas).

She told me yesterday that when she saw my son, my brother in law, my dad and I at an Astros fathers day baseball game, I was holding a beer. 

She now has said she's gonna buy a breathalyzer and anytime she feels I have been drinking while hes been in my custody, then she'll hire a lawyer and pursue full custody. 

Can I just refuse to give in to her power trip? Or how much of this can actually hold in the court?",legaladvice
TIFU by making fun of a customer from years ago to that same person,"Worked in a deli. Guy I've never served before comes in and orders a ""small coffee with lotsa milk and 17 sugars"". Can't exactly remember if I scoffed or laughed but the net result was I didn't believe him and asked him what he really wanted.

Stone serious the guy reiterated: ""small coffee, lotsa milk, 17 sugars"".

While making it I asked my co-worker/buddy what he would do he said ""tell him to Google 'diabetes'"" so he was no help. It always stuck with me because I drink my coffee black and bc he was completely nonchalant about a completely atypical order.

Fast forward to today I'm a customer in a bagel place a few towns over. I place my order with a 24oz iced coffee, black. The deli guy goes ""man I don't know how you drink black coffee"".

Just preceding the self-discovery that I'm a shmuck I asked ""wanna hear a crazy story?"" and launch into it. Just as I finish the story he looks over his shoulder at me. The instant I caught his bizarre look and he caught my deer-in-the-headlights look we both knew what happened. I paid and left without another word.

Woman claiming to own our property gave us a handwritten eviction notice [KY],"To preface this:

My dad was gifted the house and property that we currently live on by his mother in 1991, it's right below where her house used to sit. She died in 2006 and a woman and her husband bought her house in 2010 and claimed they bought our property as well. My dad informed her that he had owned the property since 1991 and had proof, then took her to court. In court, she did not hire a lawyer and tried to represent herself. The judge told her that she couldn't claim rights to our house because she didn't buy it or own it.

Earlier today, she left a handwritten note on our door that said:

""I have a buyer for this property and you have 30 Days to evict the premises.""

We're speaking to our lawyer tomorrow, but I am very stressed about it right now and am wondering if she has any chance of being able to evict us? 

Thanks for any responses.

EDIT: I made a few calls this morning to some local offices. It is for sure that we own the home on the land but there's no document of who owns the property. The lady I spoke to said, ""there was a deed and then just wasn't"" so we're going to a deed office today to clear it up. 

EDIT 2: Here is the letter:

""Mrs. [My mom's name], I, [Crazy Neighbor], owner of the property, is giving you 30 days to evict the premises. We are in the process of selling the property and already have a buyer.""

EDIT 3: We spoke to some people this morning and apparently it's still very muddy what happened. As far as we can tell, there was a mix-up somewhere between my father receiving the deed from his mother and the crazy neighbor buying the property above us. At this point it seems the best option is to lawyer up. ",legaladvice
Can my parents force a paternity test UPDATE,"Last post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can\_my\_parents\_force\_a\_pregnancy\_test/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can_my_parents_force_a_pregnancy_test/)

&#x200B;

I'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200B;

Pretty soon after I posted, I received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. I knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so I googled the law firm and lawyer's name. I couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so I reached out to them. The letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. They asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. I don't know exactly what's happening as I have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200B;

In other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that I also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. We still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

Now originally I thought, this is common in babies at birth and maybe as he got older maybe something to do with the pigmentation (right term?) would change and his skin colour would look more like ours. That never happened.

Now for some context I feel is necessary, early on in our marriage there were some trust and fidelity issues when I caught her pretty much on the brink of an emotional affair with her co worker. We stayed together and reconciled, it wasn't easy but I was glad we did and she was very remorseful about how far she had let things go. The problem is, the other guy had the same complexion that my son does. Now this realisation has got me very paranoid.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by eating a girl out and getting sent to the emergency room.,"So this actually happened about 3 weeks ago. 

Rewind to a night of heavy drinking, rocking out, and sleeping with a coworker. She was exceptionally fine so I decided to end the foreplay with a little tongue action. Everything feels clean, no offensive smell or taste. We move onto the main course and I notice a more than offensive smell, Must've dug up something deep. So I finish her and end the night.

A day later and my throat is sore, but I think nothing of it as I was drinking and smoking heavily the night before. 

Two days later, my left tonsil is black, green, and white, swollen more than 2x it's size and hurts like a mf. I go down to the local med express to have it looked at and after about 35 mins I see the doctor. With a look of concern on his face, he tells me I need to go to the ER. 'The ER?' I asked 'is it really that bad?' The doc asks me how long it's been hurting and I told him I had just noticed it today. He tells me it's very Aggressive and spreading rapidly; it's beyond his treatment. So I head down to the ER to get asked more questions and wait to see another doctor. He finally comes in, looks at it and tells me they're going to have to drain my tonsil with a syringe (which didn't feel the best, by the way).

A script of painkillers, steroids for the swelling, amoxicillin, a few tears later and I'm all better.

tl;dr eating a girl out while she has a bacterial infection might land you in the ER for tonsilitis.

Fun fact: the hospital bill was $606 :)

Toxic Femininity is worse than Toxic Masculinity,"In recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. The current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. But during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. Women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

When you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. The whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

&#x200B;

But when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. A lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. A few examples being;

* Blaming behavioural issues on periods
* Acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* Coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* Backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* Being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* Lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* Manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200B;

Some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. It's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. Some of these examples are major toxic offences. Such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

One of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

TIFUpdate: increasing my age range on tinder,"Slightly anticipated update from the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/aorggk/tifu_by_increasing_my_age_range_on_tinder/?utm_source=reddit-android

tl;dr from the above post: I increased the age range on gay tinder, finding one of my brothers best friends, accidentally superlike him, potentially outing me to my entire family

Here we go:

What a wild ride it has been, an agonizing two days of slight discomfort.
Since the last post, I took some redditors' advice, and sent him a message saying:
""I accidentally sent you a superlike on tinder, oops"", in turn owning the fact I was looking at guys his age.
He's active, but doesn't reply; I start to panic, thinking that maybe it wasn't him who I saw on tinder.

The next hour of wait is painful, until i receive a ""HAHAHAHA don't even worry man!!""

Holy shit. Phew.

The conversation continued, and we discussed how shook we both were to see eachother, a conversation I visualise* as the two spidermen pointing at each other. As it turns out, Barry only recently accepted that he's gay, and his parents are still struggling with the concept.
Barry said he'd never been able to discuss any of his feelings or experiences with anyone bc he doesn't really have any gay friends, so it's actually really fortunate what happened. 

It seems like we both gained a gay friend.

To everyone who commented on the first post that he wouldn't out me, thank you! you were right! He didn't tell a soul, and since he's not fully out himself, he said that he would never take that away from me :)))

To those asking about the wedding, no date is planned just yet, but I'll post a 10 year update, in like, 10 years.


Tl;dr: my ""fuck up"" of superliking my brother's friend resulted in me gaining a kind and trusty friend who I can now approach anytime :)

Also can we appreciate how fucking lucky I am? This ended up as the best case scenario out of them all.

TIFU by letting my kid lay in my lap NSFW,"This happened last night. My wife and I were settling down for the evening and sat down on the couch to watch TV while our 13-month old played on the floor. After a short time he apparently decided he wanted to cuddle up on the couch with us. He climbed up on the couch and crept up close to me with a smile and the lates his head down flat on my thigh. It was close to his bed time so I didn't give it a second thought.

We were both really into the show we were watching when suddenly I felt a sharp pain on the top of my penis. I mean like a turtle had just reached out and latched on. I screamed in pain at first and looked down to realize my son had shifted his head slightly against the shorts I was wearing, and just chomped down. He may still be a baby but he has some sharp ass teeth.

I grabbed him to get him off and my wife didn't understand what was happening. She thought I was just randomly in pain and trying to throw our son. It looked like that, well, because he wouldn't freaking let go. I finally tugged him away and to the floor and he screamed crying as my wife went to console him and I got up and cupped a hand to my crotch and paced back and forth with a feeling I'd never felt before.

I walked outside to get away from the crying for a moment and stinging pain wasn't stopping. After a few moments I returned inside and looked inside my pants to survey the damage. My penis was bleeding from the tip. He left a freaking indention with his teeth. Still hurts today every time anything brushes against it. I'll be way more cautious going forward about where he's laying his head. My wife later laughed and called him amazing birth control.

TL;DR Let my kid lay on my lap and found out how sharp his teeth are. Now I've got a cut and sore penis.",tifu

I (33m) overheard my girlfriend (28f) making fun of me pretty brutally to her best friend (27m). When I say brutally... I mean brutally.,"I originally posted this elsewhere, but it was deleted for whatever reason. I'm reposting so that I can link to it when I post the update. If that makes sense.

My girlfriend, ""Jenna"", and I have been together for 2 years, a little over.

I'm a veterinarian and we met at my office. She had just moved to the city and brought her dog in for an ear infection. We started talking and what should have been a 15 minute appointment turned into an hour long talking session.

I've never been so smitten with a woman before. Before Jenna, I lived the bachelor lifestyle. I was beginning to think I'd just stay single forever, even though that lifestyle of nothing but casual flings was growing really old and empty.

Jenna is a charismatic woman with a lot of friends. Her best friend is a guy, ""Dylan"", she knew in her old town. I trust Jenna but I'd be boldfaced lying if I said that her relationship with him doesn't bother me at all. I don't get angry with her or fight about it, she's reassured me that they've been friends their whole lives and have never had any sexual relationship.

I'm secure and I'm not insane, so I accept that they are friends and have tried to buddy up with him as well. He has visited the city 3 times. He's a cool guy, however, he does not seem to like me much. Jenna says he's just protective. It comes off a whole lot more like jealousy than protectiveness, in my opinion.

Jenna just finished up grad school this spring but she's had a really tough time finding a job. We have lived together for a year and I've been understanding that she can't help pay rent, etc. right now. I'm very financially secure so it isn't an issue, however, I am careful to not become a reason for her to not get a job and have her own financial independence. I just think it's important for everyone to have this sort of independence. So, without being pushy, I've let her know that she does need to start paying half of the expenses once she secures a job.

Anyway, she texted me at work on Monday to tell me she got a job. It's a job she really, really wanted and had to go through some pretty grueling interviews to get. I was so happy and proud of her that I decided to leave the rest of the day at the office up to my staff and took off early without telling Jenna.

I bought her favorite booze, grabbed a bunch of Chinese take out (her favorite), and bought her flowers.

I had bought her a nice necklace that she'd seen at a store a couple of weeks ago. Nothing super extravagant, but it has a shark on it and that woman is just obsessed with anything to do with sharks. I'd hidden it in the basement and figured I'd give it to her soon, totally surprise her with t once she'd forgotten about even seeing it in the store. I got home and came in the side entrance to the basement so I could grab the necklace and then surprise her.

When I came up the basement steps and opened the door, I could hear her talking on the phone. Normally I wouldn't stop and listen but I heard her laughing uncontrollably, like belly-laughing. It was pretty cute so I figured I'd wait for her to get off the phone before I surprised her.

She was talking to Dylan. Nothing new there, they talk at least once a week.

Then I heard what they were laughing about.

It took me a few dull minutes to realize that she was laughing about our sex life. She said something about how ""No, he can't even compare to (ex bf). Ex bf had at least 3 inches on him."" ""I feel bad every time I eat a baby carrot around him because it must be traumatic to see me chomping down on something the same size as him."" ""It would almost be cute if it didn't suck so much. His body is amazing as long as he keeps his boxers on."" Lots of laughter.

So look, I don't really give a crap what people on Reddit think about the, erm... size of my member... but, I do think it's important to say that what she was making fun of wasn't even true. Which in my opinion, makes it even more hurtful. I mean, I don't know about the ex bf, maybe he was a horse, but I'm very.... average. Just good old fashioned average. Not going to upsell myself here. It's nothing to write home about. But it's also not laughable. I've never felt self conscious, it is what it is.

To hear her ripping me apart to this guy that she knows I have some concern about was just beyond hurtful. Hurtful doesn't cover it.

She also made fun of me for being ""gorgeous but not super smart"".

Um... I'm actually highly educated. This isn't even remotely a concern of mine, I know I'm smart. Gorgeous and super smart with an average sized penis, thanks very much.

I left after that. Did I throw the flowers out of my car window? Yes. Did I cry in a parking lot? Yes.

I think she may have heard the basement door close, maybe she even saw my car driving away, because she started texting me pretty quickly after I left. Asking when I was coming home.

That was Monday and I haven't brought it up. I don't know how. I think I'm still processing everything. It's horribly embarrassing and hurtful. But... damn I love this girl. Not saying I'm going to forgive her necessarily, I just want to stress how hard this whole thing is for me.

I know I need to bring it up to her. But how? Any suggestions on how to start this conversation with her? I'm extremely hurt and I don't know if I can forgive her for this

tl;dr: My girlfriend made fun of me with her male friend. About our sex life/my penis. Pretty hurtful stuff. I feel like a puppy that just got kicked in the face. Joking aside, I'm devastated. I was planning to propose in the next few months. Now I don't see how I can even forgive her and stay with her. Advice?

Edit Wow, hey thanks everyone! I just wanted to add that I definitely will be breaking up with Jenna. I grabbed a beer with three of my friends tonight and told them. Their sentiments matched the majority of yours: dump her and do it quick. I called my mom and told her about it (yes, I told her everything, embarrassing as it was; we are pretty close and I wanted to tell her the whole story) and I've never heard her so angry about anything. She knew I'd bought a ring for Jenna. I will post an update after I do it (probably tomorrow), though it may take me a couple of days to post about it. I'm going to be pretty wrecked emotionally. Thanks again for all the comments/messages of support and encouragement, I really didn't expect everyone to be rooting for me like this!

Is my friend being inappropriate with my boyfriend?,"Best friend (23f) says she's just friends with my boyfriend (24m) and I'm being crazy/jealous about their friendship. I think I'm justified in telling her to back off because she's crossing lines. 

Context:
We both met him at a party a few summers ago and he and I started dating soon after. She's never made any indication she was romantically interested in him and encouraged the two of us from the beginning. She's also been obsessed with her on again, off again boy for years and no other guy has really caught her interest. 

She and my BF text a lot. They're really close, but it's never been an issue before.  She asks him for advice on her man, and he gives her a dude perspective on it. But then stuff got weird. She started joking about how if I don't hurry up and ""lock him down"" she will because he's such a great guy. She's said it around him before and he just shrugs it off but I find it uncomfortable. She tells me I'm too sensitive and have no sense of humor, and that the only man she's interested in is her dude. 

Then she started texting us whenever she knew we were together, with all of her drama, asking for advice like the world is ending. So we both stop and respond. 

Then she started inviting herself on dates with us. (""Oh, I've been dying to see that movie / try that restaurant / do that thing""). The three of us hang out ALL the time, but she's suddenly super needy and not letting my bf and I be a couple. For his part, he's oblivious. He thinks we get plenty of alone time since we live together. 

THEN she invited him on this backpacking trip she and her brother are taking across Europe. I was not invited. I only even found out because my BF mentioned he'd need to take off two weeks to do half of it with them (they're doing a full month). He only has two weeks of vacation time as a new hire so he can't do her trip and the trip to Florida we were planning. He asked if I would be okay with that, and if I would want to go with them instead of Florida, but I'm not big on the whole backpacking experience, especially the hiking parts. I'm so hurt that he's even considering her trip over ours. And when I asked her why I wasn't invited, she told me I could come, but I wasn't going to be able to keep up with their itinerary (I have an old knee injury from soccer that kind of kills my hiking abilities and means i walk slow as hell after a while because it hurts like a b*tch). 

Am I being a jerk? Is their relationship normal and I'm just being paranoid? At this point I'm just waiting to hear that her brother suddenly can't go, and it'll be just the two of them... I've told him how I feel about her, but he thinks it's just her personality to be needy. I can tell he's frustrated that I'm upset, but he's also frustrated because he feels like he has to choose between us. 

EDIT/UPDATE: I am absolutely overwhelmed with the responses from everyone. Truly, honestly, thank you to everyone for your advice. I wish I could respond to everyone individually but this got way more attention than I thought it would. 

I'm bracing for the conversation with my BF. I will be clear on what makes me uncomfortable and what I want him to do, though I'll try not to make it an ultimatum. As for my friend, I'm cutting those ties. If a ton of Reddit STRANGERS can turn up and care more about me and my comfort/well-being, than what kind of a friend is she to ignore it? I can't unsee how terrible she is now.

FINAL UPDATE:
Boyfriend is NOT going on the trip, but I still don't think he fully understands how inappropriate even thinking about it was. We're working on better communication, so there's that.

TIFU by seeing how fast I could go before a grasshopper slid off my windshield,"Today I was sitting at a local redlight I know all too well when BAM! What do I see? A poor, unsuspecting grasshopper staring back at me from the other side of the glass. I shoot him a quick flick clicking the windshield in the process but it only ends in a throbbing fingernail. Grasshopper unphased.

Time for plan B. As the light turns green, I survey the surroundings and giddily determine that the coast is clear, passionately pushing the pedal plum into the floorboard, revving my V4 for all she's worth, VROOOM! 10mph...15mph....my new buddy isn't budging. As several more seconds pass and 20 turns into 25..30..35..40! Oh Crap. Blue lights. I stoically pull over, glaring at the grasshopper one last time while awaiting my fate.

Update: Cancer Hoax (PA),"Update from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/926vk6/cancer_hoax_pa/)

My husband finally caved and admitted he doesn't have cancer. He was seeing an endocrinologist for an unrelated condition (gender dysphoria) and was using the money from our second mortgage and go fund me for treatment. 

I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer, and that lawyer is going to refer me to yet another lawyer, to help me sort out the massive debt I'm in, because of this situation, but he doesn't think I can be charged with fraud.

"Dentist is suing me for $15,000 over a 1 star Google review... [UPDATE]","Original post 7 months ago : [Just got served with a lawsuit seeking $15,000 in damages for leaving a 1 star review](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8fbvya/just_got_served_with_a_lawsuit_seeking_15000_in/)

&#x200B;

I messed up and didn't take the biggest piece of advice given to me repeatedly on my previous post: ""get a lawyer"". I thought I could just respond to the lawsuit citing anti-SLAPP laws in CT, fax over the form and wait for the dismissal letter in the mail...

Weeks ago, I discovered that they had not received my response and if it wasn't mailed on time It would be too late. I paid for overnight mail and it was received on time according to the person on the phone. Weeks later I receive a letter with a date for my court ""hearing"".

I went to this hearing and thankfully the judge stopped my former boss and his lawyer (who also brought a new employee to testify??!?) mid testimony and asked me if I understood what was happening because ""normally the defendant doesn't show up for this.""

The judge kindly explained to me that I had already lost by default for not responding, and they were here to determine how much money I owe in damages. I pulled out a copy of my response, and the case was continued. Today I filed the proper motion and paid a fine of $130 to re-open the case against me in the clerks office at the court house. I was told to wait for a response in the mail. I am also getting a lawyer if I can afford it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I didn't get a lawyer and filed the paperwork myself. It wasn't received by the court in time and I lost by default. The judge stopped the hearing because it was obvious I came ready to defend myself even though I had already lost.  If you give a 1 star google review, run it by your attorney first.

Edit: To all the people sending me messages calling me stupid for this...well duh? Hopefully people will read this and never forget to take even the most BS lawsuits very seriously. ",legaladvice

TIFU by removing my Diva Cup. NSFW,"After getting tired of shoving bits of cotton in my 'nanner curtains for years, I switched to the menstrual cup a while back. *For those that don't know, it's basically this little silicone cup you pop into your lady bits and you can wear for like 12 hours.*

Anywhoo, after sleeping all night, I needed to empty it. I headed to the bathroom, lined the toilet with toilet paper to prevent splash back, and proceeded to remove it. Now, I always look to see how full the cup is after removal. It's a weird thing to do, but I think it's kinda cool to see how much is in there. 

Apparently, unbeknownst to me, my bathroom spider bro was also interested in my red water tidings. As I was removing the cup, he dropped down to check out the situation. Not expecting a spider to the face that early in the morning, I jerked back, shrieked, and fell off the toilet.

 Remember what was in my hand? Yeah, It was a full cup. **Everywhere.** On the tub, on the wall, all over me, it was a mess.
Naturally, my SO heard me yell, and the thud of my lard ass falling off the toilet and came running, only to find me on the bathroom floor, covered in blood, yelling about a spider. I'm surprised the poor guy didn't faint.

TL;DR: A spider surprised me, I threw blood everywhere and my SO thought I was dying.

Edit: Holy shit guys, I wasn't expecting this many responses! For those asking, my mom came up with the nanner curtains thing and it stuck lol, and spider bro has retreated to his corner of the bathroom. Also the boyfriend is fine, slightly traumatised, but he'll live.",tifu
TIFU by going on the wrong date,"So I match with this cute girl from tinder. The conversation is flowing and I suggest we go out for drinks this past Friday. She agrees and we set the time and place. 

When I arrive at the bar 10 minutes early i try to see if she already arrived and I see her standing by the bar. She made eye contact with me and I greeted her. We started talking for quite sometime and I was getting weird vibes from her so I suggested we go grab something to eat. We get out and as I see her more clearly under the street light I exclaim ""you don't look anything like your tinder profile pictures"". That's when it hits me... This is not the girl I had a date with and just straight up hit on some random girl. I try to ask ""you are not Melanie (name altered)"" and she seems pissed of that I don't remember her name but I'm more confused than ever. 

I look at my phone and see 5 angry text messages and 3 missed calls. 

My new date didn't find it amusing and lost interest and my original date wants nothing to do with me.

LPT: Adopt an adult dog from a shelter if you want a companion but don't have time/ patience to train a puppy. They are already potty trained in most cases and love you all the same.,"Plus there are a lot of them. It's a win win for every one involved.

Edit:  So as a few people pointed out,  adult dogs are not perfect and can come with some quirks.  Make sure you do your research and are fully prepared to take on the responsibility of a pet whether it's a puppy or an adult. 

Also,  check with the shelter staff about obedience training. They often know good schools or sometimes even do it in house. 

Please adopt responsibly.

Edit 2: Wow RIP my inbox. Thank you kindly for the golds and even a silver!  Im glad this LPT has reached so many people because that means so many people are more aware about the joy of adopting adult dogs from shelters, and it's also been great reading the comments about how people have adopted adult dogs and are so loving in their families.

Edit 3: Don't forget about cats!

Was my dad really grooming me or am I overreacting?,"Hey reddit. I need your help! My (21F) father (61M) has had a very strange relationship with me my whole life. I don't live with my family anymore due to university so this isn't affecting me currently, but I am having a hard time processing it. I had another dream about it last night and I cannot bare to keep questioning these horrible thoughts anymore. Am I being stupid or is this serious?

There are little pieces of evidence that have amounted to me wondering if I had been treated wrongly by my dad. Weirdly, a lot of things don't add up and I don't want to accuse my father of anything in case I'm being over dramatic. But there have been occasions where I have known that my dad did things to me that weren't necessarily normal but I didn't say anything. 

My dad doesn't really like my brother. At all. In fact he barely talks to him unless he's getting in trouble. He loved me though. He absolutely adored me. And I adored him too. I never felt uneasy or unsafe around him. Even though he did some weird things to me. There was always something a little bit off. Even when I was little, I just had this weird gut feeling about his relationship with me. He isn't my biological dad, my real dad ran away to New Zealand when he found out my mum was pregnant with me. That's a whole other story, I have actually spoken to him since. He has three of his own kids now. 

My mum and ""dad"" met when my mum was trying to sell her house. I was only a baby at the time. One of the weird things about my relationship with my dad is that I have told lies to make him seem like he is my biological father. I don't know why I do that. It's not that I'm ashamed about him not being my real father. But I feel that maybe if I lied enough I would convince myself that he IS my real dad, and real dads don't touch their real daughters in that way. 

I distinctly having a conversation with my mum about how mum and dad met. This was the first time my tummy ever churned in regards to my dad. She said at the time they met, she hadn't washed in a few days, was struggling with post natal depression and was a single mother. She says she didn't look good whatsoever. To the point where she was so shocked that my dad had asked her out on a date, she worried that it was because of me. My dad was a really good looking man. He was very successful with the ladies. I don't know whether my mum was so insecure that she couldn't believe he would ask her out, or if she has secretly had her own gut feelings. ""What do you mean, to do with me?"" I asked. I was about 13 or 14 at the time. ""Well, I was worried that your dad might have been with me to get to you. Paedophiles come in all shapes and sizes."" I think I'll remember her saying the word paedophile until the day I die. I felt so physically sick at her saying that but it is something I think about on a daily basis. 

That's when a lot of things came flooding through into my memories. I never used to wipe after going for a pee. When I was about 8 years old I was in the bath and mum was watching me. We were discussing about toilet habits and I told her I didn't wipe. ""Why not?"" She said. ""It really hurts when I do"" my mum looked alarmed. ""What do you mean?"" I shrugged it off ""I don't know, it just hurts when I touch down there."" I think my mum was concerned but I don't think she ever found out a reason for it. But I do still remember it being tender when I tried to wipe. I can't remember when it all started. When mum was away on nightshift, he would make me sleep in the bed with him. I honestly can't say if anything happened. He would spoon me. But I don't know if anything else occurred. When my mum was on nightshift, she would get home after my dad went to work, and while she was sleeping, I would take my brother and I out. We would ""run away from home"". I was always such a well behaved girl. But my behaviour got so bad during that time that my mum broke down and told me she would put me in care because she couldn't deal with me. I remember being the problem child very vividly. It's one of the only parts of my childhood I remember. My mum had severe depression at that time too. She was actually put into counselling because I think she tried to take her life. Nobody has spoken about it but I do remember her having to get taken to this place. Which I later learned was a psychiatric hospital. I don't remember any of the time she was away but obviously it was my dad looking after us. 

Fast forward a few years and I have began puberty. I was struggling with my body image like most girls were and I was very confused about everything. I was late getting my period, I was a late bloomer and was teased pretty badly at school by both girls and boys. I have vivid memories of my dad telling me that I have a lovely figure. He squeezed my boobs and my waist and my bum on multiple occasions. ""You're soft in all the places men love women to be soft in."" I was in my school uniform the majority of the time he did it. I looked him dead in the eyes as if to say ""what the fuck are you doing?"" But he always laughed. It really embarrassed me. And most of all I was uncomfortable when he did it. He was supposed to be the one keeping me safe and yet he was the one that made me feel the most humiliated. However, I never felt daunted if I had to spend time alone with him. I didn't feel unsafe APART from when he did touch me. But I have read that one symptom of trauma is not remembering much of your childhood, and I really struggle to remember many memories of both childhood and high school. This could be a coincidence however. 

There were multiple instances where he would slap me on the bum, make me sit on his knee (as a 14/15 year old) and touch my thighs or my bum or my boobs. He would love giving me massages, and would take off my bra. I specifically remember one time I asked my mum if she could rub my back because it was really sore. I took off my bra and hit the ground as quickly as I could to avoid either of my parents seeing my boobs. My dad remarked ""Christ, you have a big set of tits now"". In front of me and my mum. It embarrassed me so much. In a moment of anger I snapped at him ""why the fuck were you even looking?"" Why would your dad WANT to see your boobs?? My mum repeated what I said to him too, which surprised me. I assume she was taken aback by it. Nothing more was ever said. 

Throughout mostly my teenage hood my dad was very hands on with me. I noticed this when I realised that my friends dads weren't nearly as touchy with their daughters. I thought my dad was just showing me affection. As teenagers do, I became aware of masturbating and it became a massive hobby for me. On multiple occasions, my dad walked in on me. And didn't make any attempts to leave. There was a few times I near enough shat myself because I noticed him peering through the crack in the door. Out of panic, I pulled up my pants and ran over to the door and opened it. It was him stood there. ""Yes?"" Was all I managed to blubber out. Then he walked away like nothing had happened. I hadn't heard him coming up the creeky stairs on any of the occasions. 

For some strange reason, and I really don't know if this is paranoia or not, but I always felt overwhelmingly scared that come my 16th birthday he would try and take things further than just inappropriate touching. I have no idea why. Again I don't know if I'm overreacting. I had a boyfriend at this point and dad then became very distant with me. I did however think it was strange that if I knocked on the bathroom door to tell him to let me know when he's out the bath so I can brush my teeth, he would tell me to come in anyway. And he would be there, naked, in the bath. Not trying to hide anything. I don't know if that's normal or not in a household? Throughout this time he did keep touching me inappropriately but again I didn't feel scared in his presence APART from when he did touch me on the odd occasion. 

I think the biggest situation that sticks out in my mind was when I had broken up with my boyfriend and was about to begin university. I asked my dad if he could crack my back as he was the heaviest in my family and always managed to. Mum and my brother we're both in bed. He then asked, ""do you want me to give you a massage"" I shrugged and said alright. I took off my top and he did my back for a while. Nothing weird happened. But then he took off my pyjama bottoms and my pants without even asking. He started rubbing my bum cheeks and my thighs as I laid there in shocked silence. He then proceeded to rub my vagina from behind and my bum hole. At one point he spread apart my bum cheeks to, I suppose ""inspect"" my ""area"". I was absolutely mortified. He did this for about 10 minutes or so. That was the only hard evidence I have for him properly inappropriately touching me. I thought this was going to be the time he raped me. I thought all those years of being scared about turning 16 were finally rational, as horrible as it sounds. I was now 17 but had been with my boyfriend since before I was 16. So my dad hadnt been as full on with the touching. I laid completely still. I didn't tell him to stop. I was so embarrassed. But at the same time I didn't want to embarrass him by telling him it was wrong. So I just let him and hoped nothing would progress. It was the most uncomfortable and ashamed I had ever felt in my life at that point. The only time he spoke to me was to say ""you're very hairy aren't you"" which added to the awkward and embarrassing situation. I never ever told anyone about it. 

I didn't tell a soul about my fathers actions towards me the whole time it happened. I continue and have since the age of about 12 had dreams about my father having sex with me. In all of the dreams, I enjoy it and want it. This confuses me even greater. I feel extremely lost and embarrassed and so utterly ashamed of myself. I'm scared that I'm overreacting with this. I don't want to accuse him of anything. I love my dad but it's no doubt that he is mentally ill. I am not angry at him, I actually feel very sorry for him. This is more for my peace of mind. I just don't want to be confused anymore. And I keep dreaming about it and it's terrifying me that it is a reality.  If anyone would be able to make sense of all this I would be eternally grateful. Thank you so much for listening, it's taken great courage. 

Edit: I cannot thank everyone enough for their kind words. It was extremely hard to write but whilst writing I was actually able to process a lot of it. I am in the process of replying to everyone who has sent me messages, I didn't expect this to blow up at all. When I began receiving the first couple of replies I did have a big cry. I was hoping to myself I was being extremely stupid and I had been overthinking about it all. First thing on Monday, I am ringing a counsellor. That is for certain. I am extremely wary about telling my mum but I'm going to see how I get on with therapy. I know it's the right thing to do, but part of me is thinking that ignorance is bliss. I dont want to tear my family apart. These feelings may change if/when I begin to open up. I'm extremely lucky that I have a loving and understanding boyfriend who unfortunately has also suffered from child abuse. He has had therapy for his and is urging me to do the same (for my diagnosed depression- it's probably linked to all of this tbh). He's the first person I'm going to tell in person. I actually wanted to tell him but I thought a reddit opinion would either tell me to cop on or realise that it was as serious as my gut feeling told me. Unfortunately it was the latter. If this has taught me anything, it's that yeah there are horrible cruel people, but you strangers have shown me kindness. I can't thank you all enough <3",relationship_advice

But when he talks about it, mostly on anniversaries like today, he says ""God is good,"" and ""thanks to God."" Fine. He can do that. But I don't believe in God, and I feel that saying that undermines the fact that I independently chose to give him part of my body. I don't think he means it maliciously. The whole family talks about it this way, actually, and it is really getting to me. I am not close to my cousin but I feel that giving away body parts is a big deal. Do I just let it go? Partly I think I wanted to do this to show that atheists can be kind, that you don't need God to do good things, to be good.

So, I don't know if I should approach the situation in anyway, or let it go and deal with it in my own.

My (32M) girlfriend (30F) can't accept that I still love (and will always love) my late wife. How can I make her believe I value our relationship despite this?,"My wife died unexpectedly 5 years ago. She was the love of my life and we were together nearly ten years before she passed away. After years of not even wanting to date or be involved with anyone else, I got together with my current girlfriend about one and a half years ago. We get along great and I honestly do love her. We moved in together 4 months ago. Everything about our relationship is great except she doesn't believe it's ""right"" that I still love my wife and miss her. She doesn't like the fact that I still have some of her things and photos of her etc. I thought she had a point about her/our photos being all around our apartment (she moved in with me) being disrespectful to her so I took the ones in the living room and bedroom but kept some in my study which is a room that mainly I only use. I also put all the other stuff I have of hers and from our time together in a cupboard in my study and keep it locked. I feel like I have made many an effort to reassure her and make her comfortable yet she is still not happy. She doesn't like that I still talk to my wife's family. She kind of expects me to pretend I was never married which is ridiculous. We have been fighting more and more because of this.  

I really do love my girlfriend but when she asks me things like whether I love still love my wife or whether I love her more than I do my girlfriend, it's hard for me to lie and say that I don't. And I don't think I should be expected to either. I didn't want my wife to die. I never wanted to have to find anyone else. But that is what happened and I love my girlfriend too. But I will always love my late wife too. How can I convince her that this is indeed possible? Am I not being accommodating enough? Am I being unfair to my girlfriend?

It's just the way I feel. But I do understand the point everyone is making about this being unfair to my girlfriend. I honestly do love her and try to be a good partner to her. But I think I do have to think about what is best for her and that may not be being with me. But at the same time I feel lile that is ultimately her decision. We do have a great relationship otherwise. From the comments, I have realised maybe I can never be ready to be in a relationship in the same way with someone else and that is unfair to my gf. She deserves better.A serious discussion is definitely needed.",relationship_advice

TIFU by ignoring testicle pain,"So this happened a few days ago.  Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I had just gotten home from work (I work from 9-3) and I decided to take a nap for a few hours before I had to make dinner.  As I was starting to fall asleep I rolled over and then felt a weird pain in my left testicle.  It didn't feel like it had been hit, but rather like it was being squeezed.  I assumed I was laying on it or something and rolled again, but the pain stayed.  I wanted nothing more than to sleep and I knew if I had laid on it the pain wouldn't just go away instantly, so I tried my best to ignore it and managed to fall asleep.  This would turn out to be the biggest mistake of my life.

I woke up 2 hours later and I felt like my dick and I felt a pain greater than anything that I've ever felt.  My left testicle felt like it had been attacked by a cobra, and was having it's life slowly squeezed from it.  I knew right then something was wrong, I've been hit in the balls before, but this is something else.  I reached down to feel it and the whole thing just felt weird. My parents weren't home (I'm 17) and there was no way I'd be able to drive myself to the hospital, so I had to call my neighbor who rushed me there.  The pain was just getting greater as time passed to the point where I threw up out her car window at one point.

The first thing they did when I got there was give me some morphine.  This helped me a little, and I was able to stay still long enough for them to do an ultrasound.  While they were comparing my balls, the doctor told me that I was most likely dealing with testicular torsion.  For those of you who have only heard of that from Cards Against Humanity but have no idea what it actually is, basically it's when the spermatic cord twists, and cuts off the blood flow to the testicle.  If it isn't treated soon enough, the testicle could die and have to be amputated.  The doctor gave me a lot of crap for going back to sleep instead of taking the pain seriously, because I was really cutting it close time wise and they weren't completely sure if they were going to be able to save it.

I learned that the way to fix it would be to perform a surgery where they cut open the scrotum and manually untwist the cord.  They put me under, and I went to sleep praying that they would be able to save my testicle.

They couldn't.

Today's the first time I haven't been heavily medicated since the surgery, and I want to use this TIFU as a PSA.  If you think something might be wrong with your balls, TREAT IT LIKE IT'S SERIOUS.  I already have a low sperm count, and the doctor told me it's very unlikely that I'll be able to have kids now that I can only produce half as much.  Please guys, take care of your testicles.

Edit:  Holy shit gold!  Thanks for the support everyone.

TIFU by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended,"Obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. My brother and I have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). This agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so I was convinced he still remembered.

A couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". Eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. I got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. I decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

Near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. There's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. So I went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""[brother's name], if you're watching this, I'm already dead. Everyone on the world pretty much is. It's been about eight months since you went to [hospital name]. You need to head for the safe haven in Helsinki (we live in western Canada) - mom might be there. God speed."" I managed to sync it up to the TV and woke him up as it was starting.

This is where it all goes to complete shit. My brother began to lose it immediately. He started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. I grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. Nurses came in and I was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

He got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. My mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. My dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. I'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. I've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

Worth the wait though.

tl;dr: Convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

EDIT: Wow this blew up?! I don't have a ton of time but:

1) I don't want to upload the video. I made it sound tamer than it was, I look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xD

2) The TVs in the hospital had HDMI ports. I just plugged it into my Chromebook. 

3) I can see why people say I made this up for karma, but I didn't create a throwaway to do that.  If I cared that much, I would've posted it on my main account.

4) My mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. She hasn't been happy with me moving (western Canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. She paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",tifu

my (21F) bf (20) told me he would break up with me if I got breast augmentation surgery,"so I have, what is known as, ""tuberous breasts"" where during puberty the breast tissue doesn't develop like it should. the breasts develop droopy & the areolas are large & not proportional to the size of my breast. my plastic surgeon has confirmed this is what it is & told me that if I wanted to correct it, surgery is the only option. the surgery would include releasing the constricted tissue & then an implant will be placed above the muscle.

I am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because I know they don't look normal. I just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

I mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn't want a girl with ""fake boobs"". he won't even listen to me when I tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

I 100% plan on going through with the surgery. I told my doctor up front that I did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in April, the day before mine & my bf's anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i'm doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.


TL;DR: I have tuberous breasts & the only way to correct it is surgery. my bf completely shot down the idea bc he doesn't want to date a girl with fake boobs.",relationship_advice
[Ontario] My Roomate has just told me I'm supposed to move out so her boyfriend can move in *We are both on the lease*,"Location: Ontario. 

I have been on lease at a shared two bedroom with a roommate for 3+ years. Both of our names are on the lease. 

Due to health reasons, I legally subletted my room for 8 months (ongoing.) The landlord has approved the sublease. I am in a different city with family, currently. Did due dillegence to find a great roommate to share spade etc, they (the subletter and roommate) get along fine etc. 

My roomate has messaged be out of the blue, now saying that she intends for her new boyfriend of four months to move in after the sublease ends in June, and if I want to return to the city, I will have to find new accommodation, as he will be replacing me. 

Now, I fully intend to move back to the city- as I have to finish my Uni degree there. The location is ideal and frankly I wouldn't be able to find something as affordable (I pay under 500 for my room) and would likely have to put off returning to school longer if I needed to worry about moving expenses and now pay 700+ in rent in rando student accommodation. The apartment, I view as my home, as I do not have permanent residence elsewhere. 

So, I don't want to leave. Does she have a legal case to 'kick me out', provided I don't extend the sublease past 12 months? 

Additionally, what can I do to protect myself? 

Additional context: my sublets room is furnished with my furniture, and about half the apartment furniture is mine / all the plates etc. I left those items there because I have known my roomate for 8 years and intended on returning. (Although, they made a fuss about me keeping things in our storage locker, wanted me to leave certain things but empty them of my belongs so they could use etc..  but that's a story for another time and another subreddit)

They have a wee bit of a mean streak, and I just want to make sure all my bases are legally covered, so that I can return assuming I don't find other accommodation. (In the far off hypothetical I found something better, I would give 60 days notice to the landlord, her etc) 

I am hoping this can be sorted though us talking. 

Last- is there anyway she could move the boyfriend in without my consent if he is not on the lease? 

Thanks in advance guys.


Edit: thanks for the response so far. To clarify 

Regarding Lease Renewal: This is our 4th year on the lease, and in Ontario once you've been a resident for 12 months, the lease rolls over month to month, to my understanding. For the past two years we have, at the end of 12 month in july, we have signed new rental agreement's with the max allowable rent raise (1.5% a year or something) 

So I believe that I am legally protected by the lease, and my right to the apartment stay as long as subletting is less than a year and a day. (I still pay the rent, after deposited to me by the subletter and the onus if the subletter *did not * pay fall soley on me)

Could someone versed in Ontario Law please confirm my understanding? 

Updated: Wow everyone thanks for all the advice. I'm hoping to resolve this with my roommate and I've sent her a message. I'll also be looking into chatting with a professional if nessisary.  ",legaladvice
AITA for telling my British neighbors they should learn chinese because we live in china?,I saw s similar post which inspire me this. I'm Albanian and I live in Guangzhou China. I live in an apartment building that's filled wit mostly Chinese people and one British couple. They've been here 3 years longer than I have and can't say anything other than NIHAO and XIEXIE. They constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which I told them to stop and start learning chinese. I taught myself to be half fluent in Chinese before I got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months I've been here. They managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic English but they left. I told them that they've been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. Yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. I told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying I'm an asshole and I'm making their lives difficult. I told them I'll start speaking to them in chinese and Albanian from now on,AmItheAsshole
AITA for ignoring the grandson that is the product of my son's affair?,"I will try to keep this short. My son cheated on his wife with another woman and got the other woman pregnant. After a lot of counseling and soul-searching, my son and his wife decided to remain married. They have three kids (2 girls and a boy), who are obviously my grandchildren. I am very close with them and have spoiled them since they were born. 

I have no relationship with the child my son had with the other woman. I believe he is almost 2 now. I think it would pain my daughter-in-law (who is like my own daughter - I have known her since she was in her young teens) if I had a real relationship with this child. She never talks about him at all. As for my son, I know he pays child support. I believe he sees the child only occasionally though. Maybe once every few months - I'm not sure. 

Anyhow, the child's mother reached out to me. Apparently she got my number from my son. She told me who it was and basically asked if I wanted to have a relationship with my grandson. I said I wasn't sure it was a good idea and she hung up the phone. 

I obviously told my son about this phone call. He said he gave the woman my number but he didn't know what she was going to say. When I explained what she wanted, he had no reaction. So I dropped the subject. 

I'm posting this on a new account because I prefer not to have my personal family business on my primary one. I am just looking for impartial judgment. Thanks.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by snacking my wife's sister on the ass during a coed softball game thinking she was my wife.,"Most TIFUS don't get posted the same day they happened, this one is no different.
Flash back 3 and a half years ago to our fall league of softball. My wife's family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband's, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.

Just a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and I being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) 

Cut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. Upon reaching the dug out, I see my wife in front of me walking in. I decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  Immediately something felt off. I've smacked my wife's ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows I enjoy it. The reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. My wife's sister turns around (who is much much MUCH more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. 
""I.. Uh... Thought you were.. Zelda"" I babbled 
I start panicking because I just spanked my sister in law's ass in front of the entire game and didn't want to be murdered by my wife. I turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so I could get away from my soon to be death. 
Luckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.
They all laugh and I am still made fun of every time we play. I now always make sure to look at my wife's face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) 

My wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. 

TL:DR smacked my wife's sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn't get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still",tifu
"""OK boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from Millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.","Facts:

•	Millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did—despite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	Cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	There is not one single state in the United States where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	Student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in America, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	Cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


For example, the Bureau of Census reports that the average price of a new home in June 1998 was $175,900.

According to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. The same report places the average sale price for June 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

A gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in June 2014, when adjusted for inflation. The actual national average price, as of July 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

The median household income in 1998 was $38,885. The most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. The Bureau of Census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

This did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. CEO salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

Millennials TRULY have it harder than our parents did.

•	We cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

And yet, Boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. That we're lazy and entitled. 

No, we're not. The data shows that Millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

For years now, when Boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

We learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. So now we just say, ""OK boomer"".

AITA for telling my soon to be sister-in-law that if she brings her children to my wedding I'd have her ejected by secruity.,"I'm going to try cut a long story short here.

Basically I'm getting married soon, yay me. My partners family has been heavily involved due to tradition and wanting the wedding to be somewhat traditional, which I have no problem with. The wedding is going to be traditional and their parents have helped with funding some of the wedding.

Now we have no children, and don't plan on having any any time soon. However, their sister does, she has three. We've asked all of our friends and my family to not bring children to the wedding at any part during the day as we don't want kids there. Now I work with kids and have no problem with kids but I know that a lot of kids don't have very much spacial awareness for the scenarios there in. Therefore me, and my partner, don't want children at the wedding.

My family was fine with it, our friends are fine with it. Sister-in-law throws up a fuss.

We've hired out quite a nice place for the event and it comes with an on site secruity for the event. At my partners birthday party the other week my sister-in-law was adamant that she was bringing her children to the days proceedings. We argued for a bit but in the end I just told her that if she brings her kids to my wedding I'd have her and her kids ejected by secruity.

While my partners on my side I'm getting a lot of fall-back from her family and it's just causing a whole lot of headache for everyone, I'm unsure how I'm going to solve it.

So AITA? Did I go too far?

WIBTA if I gift a globe to my flat earth friend?,"So next weekend my FE friend is getting a little surprise bday party thrown for him. His gf is organizing the party, it's going to be just friends and family at his mom's house and a pretty friendly atmosphere. As a joke, but not really, I want to buy him a globe as a present. So WIBTA if I did that? He's pretty adamant about it being a flat earth and he will probably launch into some diatribe about his beliefs so I think I already know the answer, but hey that's my sense of humor and I also could see it as hilarious. Thoughts?

Edit: This is absolutely 100% not a troll or s/post whatsoever. I'm sorry some people have nothing better to do than to Spost or troll people, but that is not the case at all. If I didn't care about his friendship I would link to his FB so you can all see for yourself but I am not going to do that. I am friends with him because I know his whole family, I am friends with all of them from his mom to his uncles, brother, cousins and even his kids are friends with my kids. Our friendship is strong and he's not going to be butthurt and in his feelings over this he will tell me to Foff, maybe punch me in the arm and then move on. Anyways it's a small minority that think I shouldn't do it and that have no sense of humor, I am going to get him a real gift, not just the gag gift globe. And thanks for all the support and the people that still have a sense of humor in this day and age. It will be done and I will update, so click that save button or use the remind bot, party is Saturday so check back on Sunday. Peace, love and chicken grease, I'm out for now.

Update: I didn't video the unveiling, but it was funny AF! He was a little bit irritated about it, but he took it with humor he said who the F got me this a couple times to the crowd, I couldn't keep from busting up laughing and fessing up to doing it, he was like fuck u bud, lol'ing, then I gave him some wax and a blunt as the real gift, his mom gave him shit about being FE, and we all kinda clowned on him for a few mins,he took it great, talked shit back & his one conspiracy theory cousin was on his side, they pushed back a little bit but we all just joked and laughed and got on with the party. 10/10 highly recommend it to anyone who has a FE friend who has a sense of humor.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for sending an explicit video my ex sent to me to hurt me to her family,"Hi AITA. I am going to try to make this as brief as possible so I don't ramble.

&#x200B;

I dated Em for a year and a half. During this time I confided in her some personal secrets, which I don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. Because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that I am very sensitive towards.

&#x200B;

We did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. I broke up with her because I found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. Recently I found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. She basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information I shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200B;

I sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. She replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. That was the last straw for me, and I sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what Em sends me when I ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200B;

Her familly is quite religious and they lost it. Apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. AITA?

&#x200B;

TL:DR my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. I sent them to her family. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Well this blew up. I'll try and answer some of the things I have seen asked most often here:

&#x200B;

1: I feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that I have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. To put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, I was a victim of CSA for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. It led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that I struggle with to this day (I never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that I've done that I'd like to not have spread around). She has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200B;

2: By all of her friends and family, I meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. I worded that terribly. I have not been in the best headspace as of late. Sorry.

&#x200B;

3: We have not spoken since. I have no desire to speak to her ever again. My coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and I have not heard anything from him. As petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all I care. I have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. Maybe I am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. I feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200B;

4: I will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. I have the money to fight a legal case if I have to, though obviously, I would rather not.

&#x200B;

yeah. that pretty much the main things I wanted to clear up. I'll go through the thread tomorrow if I feel up to it and see if there's anything else. It's a bit of a shitshow and I'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",AmItheAsshole

"New York - I've been visited by CPS 8 times, to enquire about a child I don't have. At what point it becomes harassment or stalking?","There's a CPS agent that seems to be convinced that I have a child and I'm locking the child in my home. First time I was visited, I was very understanding. I allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. Everything seemed fine. Obviously no child and no evidence of one, because I don't have a child.

This was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until I stopped cooperating. I told her that from now on the only way I'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. A few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. The officer told me that it will be a lot easier if I allowed them to look at my house, I allowed the officer to do that by himself. Again, no child was found. His search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

Two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times I have refused to talk to her. Once, as I left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. It definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. I called the police but it went nowhere. I have called the CPS office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. This last incident happened this last Thursday.

This woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. Everyone has told her that I don't have a child. 

This definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. If this was a legitimate CPS operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, I'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance I guess? But they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. So maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

This is really going too far and is affecting my life. I actually fear for my safety now. I will install security cameras this week and will call the police if I found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the CPS.

Do I have a legal recourse here? Like filing a restraining order against the CPS (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? This definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. Not sure how stalking is defined legally. What's the best way to stop her?

"LPT: For those in flooded areas, use extreme caution when walking on streets and sidewalks.

Rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood).

Use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.

AITA for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her African American boyfriend to her grandparents?,"Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

So we decided to fuck with the sub.,"# Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. 

**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!

**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**

> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)

> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)

> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**

> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?

> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# Original Thread Info

Hey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). 

We think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode

For the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be ""Best"" instead. 

**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage.

Lack of women or men in any trade is not a problem.,"Disclaimer: I am in no way, shape or form saying inclusivity is bad. 


I keep hearing people talk about a lack of women in STEM fields. Why should an under qualified woman (or vice versa) be chosen over a highly qualified man (or vice versa) engineer just to fill some stupid quota? The gender quota should not have been a thing because companies should always hire based on skill and qualifications. Also, if a girl wants to become a model, so what? Who's to stop her? If a boy wanted to become an engineer, who's to stop him? So what?


I think what I'm trying to say is: people are making a mountain out of a molehill, when it comes to a lack of women or men in certain fields.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.,"Okay, so by TIFU standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony I unintentionally put myself through, I think it qualifies.

I have fairly weird-sized feet.  They're very wide, but not all that long.  I have no arch to speak of.  I'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  I'm pretty short so I should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

Wrong.

When I was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure I had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

As an adult, I assumed, well, since I'm full-grown, I should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  For me, that's a size 10 (US).

Problem was, I kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, I'll switch to size 10W.

Still no luck.  Still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  My running shoes were so ill-fitted that I actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

My friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5W Nikes.  I said, ""Sure, fuck it, I'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

Oh.  My.  God.

It was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  I was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  I had no idea how much misery I had been in until I wore those shoes.  I wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because I was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  There's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

TL;DR - I'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years I have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because I was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",tifu
TIFU by accidentally causing my mum's DMs to flood with dick pics,"This one actually happened today. So basically my mum runs a language school online. My part in this business is to manage the social media side, sort out advertising etc... Anyways today I thought it would be a good idea to post a few ads on some language related Facebook groups as the new academic year is soon approaching and people are starting to look for tutors. One of these groups had around 40k members. I checked the sidebar and rules - all seemed good. Then I had a look at the top few posts just to make sure that it seemed the right place to post an ad - also looked ok, other than one post where a dude had uploaded a picture of one of the moderators, calling her beautiful and whatnot. A little creepy but the comments seemed to agree with my opinion, so I just overlooked it. 

So I post the ad (basically stating what languages she teaches, the great reviews she has blah blah), and 5 minutes in it's doing really well - like the best an ad for this page has done so far. I'm pretty stoked and watch the likes flood in continuously. A few people get in contact, enquiring about prices and such. I reply and switch off the laptop about 15 mins later. Thanks to Murphy's law, I ran out of data earlier on in the day, so I told my mum to keep an eye on the messages whilst I was out as I wouldn't receive them. So I go out and about an hour after leaving I see like 10 messages from my mum. They started off along the lines of ""Why is the page suddenly getting loads of messages?"" and by message number 10 I read ""PLEASE DELETE WHATEVER YOU POSTED IM GETTING REALLY WEIRD PEOPLE CONTACTING ME IM TRYING TO DELETE THEM BUT I CANT"". I call her, but she can't answer as she's teaching so I rush home, open the page messaging service only to be greeted by an overwhelming number of ""enquiries"". I open the first one andddd.... Yep it's a dick pic. So is the one after that, and the one after that, and so on. At this point I'm just sitting there cringing about the fact that I just looked at probably the first dick pic my mum has ever seen... and the next 10 after that. Bare in mind that I have to go into every conversation in order to block the person, so there was no escaping this. 

My mum finished the lesson and I told her that I sorted it out, and explained to her that the fact that her profile picture was a picture of her (not a man basically) is probably what caused all these to come flooding in. She asked if I saw any of the messages and I replied with ""A few inevitably as I had to click on each conversation in order to get the block option"". I don't think my mum thinks I ever saw any naked human other than myself before this happened and it's 100000% awkward as she knows that I just went through shlong city. Still have no clue as to why there were so many creeps on there but I guess that's just what comes with a big group.

Safe to say I'll be taking a brake from the business for a little while now. 

TL;DR I got quite a few dick pics sent to my mum's page due to an advert that I posted in a Facebook group. I'm pretty sure she didn't know what a dick pic was before this happened.

Edit: there are a few of you who misread  ""I don't think my mum thinks I ever saw any naked human other than myself before this happened"" - to clarify, I don't think my mum thought that I had ever seen anyone else naked lmao",tifu

"Ex-landlord trying to move people into our old apartment while we're still paying rent on it, and keep our deposit","I live in Denver, CO for reference.

&#x200B;

My wife and I recently signed a lease on a new apartment. We have paid rent on the old apartment up until January 31st so we are not fully moved out yet. We still have some belongings at the old place and haven't finished cleaning it. Our lease ends on Feb 1st. We told our landowner we would be moving around January 8th, so that he would have time to find a new tenant. I already told him that if he wanted someone to move in before the end of January he would have to give us the pro-rata rent for the rest of the month, and give us enough notice to fully move out, and he agreed. I just got a voicemail from him telling me he has someone moving into our old place in THREE HOURS and that they're not refunding our deposit because the blinds are dirty and the garden needs weeding (both things we were going to do before the end of the month of course). Our deposit was $1200. To really rub salt in the wound, the place was a shitheap when we moved in and we made many improvements to it at our own cost, such as fixing broken windows, repainting dirty walls, replacing broken fixtures etc. We have lived there for 2 years and he has consistently told us what excellent tenants we are and how much he appreciates the care we take of the property.

LPT: If you're ever in a car crash don't tell anyone the accident was your fault even if you think it might be. Do not sign any document unless it's for the police or your insurance agent.,"This is why you have an insurance company. Let them handle it. The more you say at the scene, the more problems you might cause in your defense later. Be polite, but when it comes to assessing what happened its best to stay quiet.  Take photos of all vehicles involved and the accident scene and help anyone who might be injured, if it is safe to do so. 

You may think that the crash was 100% your fault and later learn that there were other factors that contributed to the crash that were outside of your control.

My ex bf died by getting out of a car on the freeway. I was not there when it happened but am being held responsible because he did it because of me and was saying he was upset over me before getting out of the car(he was drunk). we dated off and on for two years and had a pretty volatile relationship. he cheated on me and lied a lot and I always took him back but built resentment towards him. this led to me making mean comments and not being super supportive or nice all the time. I knew he had issues with depression and he was hospitalized a few months before he passed. he accused me multiple times of cheating on him while he was in the hospital and it was so hurtful because I was miserable the whole time he was there. looking up on forums like this on what to do and for help.

we got back together and he ended up cheating on me 2 more times that I know of. we still kept in contact and continued the vicious cycle of I'm sorry I love you I need you to I cheated and am lying behind your back until I was finally at my breaking point. I felt like he genuinely was sorry for the things he did but it hurt so bad. I loved and cared for him so much and gave him so many chances and it always ended the same and I couldn't do it anymore. I could see myself becoming depressed and acting in ways that wasnt me.  I started talking to other guys bc I think I thought if i did I would feel better about what he did to me.

I was so mad and told him I slept with someone else and how I was finally done and that he was a piece of shit and I couldn't be apart of his life and to let me move on. I spoke out of anger and couldn't recognize that he was ill because I was so caught up in my own hurt and feeling betrayed by him. he died a week later. I feel guilty and confused and have received mean messages from family members and friends for ""being the biggest reason this happened"". he was so hurtful to me and I don't think they know what really went on with us, but they think I'm this evil person that knew he was depressed and bullied him until he couldn't take it anymore. theres many days I feel that I am. someone said he was depressed because I cheated and that I should live with the guilt forever and if I tried to go to the funeral someone would need to plan mine. I am filled with so much regret and can't stop thinking of what I could have done differently. I wish I could have seen past my anger and helped or at least left earlier so I wasnt causing stress. how do I move forward and find peace the self blame/guilt is too much at times.",relationship_advice

"AITA for running through neighborhoods in the early morning, making security lights come on and dogs bark?","I (26F) like to go for a run in the morning before I go to work. I usually set out around 5:00 AM so I can make sure to get at least 5 miles in at a time before having to get ready for work. Well depending on the time of year, I'm either running around sunrise or wrap up before, which means that people in the neighborhood have those security lights that pop up if you're in the area.

Well people started complaining about their lights being triggered and their dogs flipping out at early times, and people on their stupid doorbell cameras will look at people going by and several people posted videos of me running by. I'm identifiable because I have a headlamp and flashers to make sure cars see me.

This was on that Nextdoor app so I chimed in to say hey, sorry about that! And got dogpiled by people telling me to change up my route, or have more respect. Some people told me to go to a gym, why don't I run in the afternoon or evening etc etc. I told them I had no way of remembering whose house has what lights or what dogs and that it's just something we all have to deal with. I'm not going around complaining about the sprinklers that come on and drench me because they aren't calibrated right! And then said that I love to run in the morning because it makes me feel good through the day to which someone said ""Yeah try getting woken up by some smartass who won't be neighborly enough to just go to the gym!""

Anyway I've gotten some really nasty notes and people keep posting videos of me and comments saying that I should really get a gym membership and other people calling me rude because the dog barks and wakes up the baby or something. I don't enjoy running on a treadmill. Never have, never will. Besides why pay out the ass to be leered at and hit on by gross dudes when I can run in the darkness and watch the sun rise? Seems like a no-brainer, right?

My best friend has suggested I just head out later, but I won't have enough time for the rest of my routine (shower, breakfast, etc) if I do that.

&#x200B;

ETA: Tried to grab all the INFO questions. 

1 - There are no parks nearby large enough for me to run in. The only one around here is about one block, and it is surrounded by houses. I pass this park already. There are no ""trail systems"" or anything like that either. 

2 - I don't run the same exact path every day. No matter which street I run on, there's inevitably security lights and dogs. I have 5 or 6 different routes I'll take. I don't think it's even the same dogs barking at me on those routes. 

3 - I don't have a car, so I can't just drive out somewhere else. 

4 - Again, I'm not getting a gym membership. My budget doesn't include that kind of luxury, and the closest affordable gym here is about 6 miles away to begin with. 

5 - I can't run later in the morning. I have to be out the door at a certain time to get my full 5 miles in.  5:00-630, exercise (warm up and cool down included). 6:30-7:30, getting ready (shower, coffee, breakfast, put together lunch or it's already made, makeup, hair, getting dressed). If I don't leave for the bus at 7:45, I will not get to work on time.

Told that my eight hour shift is now thirty six hours and I'll be fired if I fall asleep. [Washington],"Like the title says. I work at a 24-hour post as a security guard and we are majorly understaffed. 

I showed up at 2PM expecting to work 2-10 and another 2-10 tomorrow. 

My boss tells me there was a call-off and could I please show up at 10am tomorrow to work 10-10. I agreed. 

My boss went home and called me two hours into my shift to tell me my relief would not be showing and that he couldn't find a replacement. 

I told him I could either work overnight or pull a 12 tomorrow, but I cannot work 32 hours straight and safely drive home. 

I also have a medical condition I need to take medication for and a missed dose will give me debilitating withdrawal symptoms. 


My boss informed me that he was going to bed and would be turning off his phone. 


It's 11:30PM and I've tried contacting everyone up the chain. Nobody has so much as an estimate as to when I can go home- they're all asleep or punting the problem to someone else (who is asleep). 

If I leave, I'll be fired. If I fall asleep, I'll be fired. 

What's my best move?

(Edited for spacing)

Edit: it turns out what my bosses are doing isn't illegal but I seriously doubt they'll fire me when it means they'll be down three workers instead of two.

"During the process of repairing an acquaintance's laptop, I found a folder containing several videos and photos of child pornography. I'm freaking out about it, and don't know exactly how I should handle telling the authorities.","Throwaway Account for obvious reasons

Quick background: I work in IT Security, but have a few side jobs that I do for fun/extra money. One of those side jobs is repairing laptop computers, tablets, cell phones, etc. I also do custom PC builds for people as well.

So, the way I network is through word of mouth, and business cards. Long story short, a guy at my kickboxing academy approached me and asked if I could fix his laptop. He told me he was having performance issues, and complained that his PC freezes and blue screens with no warning.

I go through the normal routine, and have him sign a contract agreeing to pay me for my services, as well as granting me full control over the device while I carry out repairs, etc. 

He agreed, and asked that if the computer can't be fixed, at least recover his files to the best of my ability and place them on an external drive for safe keeping. 

Now, I have a big disclaimer that I have the person sign off on that literally reads as follows: ""I will respect the privacy of your data, however I will look into any area that the problems you're having may lead me to. That being said is there anything on the computer that you would not want me to see?"" if the user says yes, I tell them to clean up the computer and bring it back when its safe for me to look at. I'm not interested in looking at naked pictures of the guy or his wife, for example. This guy said no, and signed off on the disclaimer.

long story short, the laptop was an older model but I was able to get everything up and running again. However, this is where the story gets messed up. 

After running a quick virus scan on the machine, I notice over 100 malicious items being found. 80ish of which were located in ONE FOLDER. So, I crack open the folder to take a look, as a lot of people download malicious software without really knowing what they're getting into. 

Well, I found an entire series of photos and videos on the computer. I clicked one (stupidly) and saw a young girl (pre-adolescent) engaged in sexual activity with an adult. The others had similar file names, and were clearly pornographic videos and photos from what little I could see in the thumbnail. Honestly, I've never felt more sick to my stomach than I did last night when I saw that picture.

My mind is a mess right now. I couldn't sleep last night and I'm not really sure what to do. I took screen shots of the file system to prove that they were last modified/viewed BEFORE I received the computer as to not implicate myself in any way. 

How in the Hell am I supposed to report this?

My dog keeps getting attacked by an emotional support dog in our apartment.,"\[Wisconsin\] There is an 8 month old male German Shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. I have a six month old Australian Shepherd. We live on the fifth floor and the GS lives about four doors down. We run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

He has attacked my AS in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. He attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the GS was hostile. The worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. When we walked inside the GS was off his lease and immediately started attacking my AS. The owner did not immediately intervene. I got down to try to get between the GS and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. After about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the GS off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. I took pictures after the event. I had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my AS's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

I first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. They said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. I spoke with the owner of the GS after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their GS just for on the grounds. The attacks have happened so often that I do not think they can easily control their dog. My AS is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from GS's if he sees them in public.

After seeing the GS and the owner for about a week after these events, I kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. I spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. She said that the 8 month old GS is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. I suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. She said she is not comfortable with that.

I do not know the logistic of ESD's but I do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. What should I do in this situation? I feel that if I go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume ESD's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** this post got a lot of responses and I'm so thankful for it. I read all your comments. Unfortunately the post was locked before I even got off work so I didn't get to reply to all.

Stemming from the advice I got I contacted the apartment again via email so that I'd have a paper trail, I explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a ESD"". I also provided links to local government sites stating that ESD's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. I am awaiting their response.

I also called the local Department of neighborhood services. I filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

In lieu of this, I then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. The owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. She remembered the incident and said that I had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. She said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

So now I will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. I feel pretty ready to get this started now.

Thank you to everyone who came here to help. I really had no idea where to go with this. I'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. I blame the owners completely for this. I'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. My goal is for the GS to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. Thanks for everyone's care and advice!

TIFU by drinking peanut butter,"Quick statement, This isn't my account, but u/TheGemScout is a close friend of mine and since I don't use reddit I figure someone should get the karma, if you guys happen to enjoy my pain. (Also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)

So lets preface this. There's an episode of Two & a Half Men where Jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then He offers Charlie some. 

So I'm at my friend's house, let's call the friend Mason, and we're watching reruns of the show. We see that fatefull scene and Mason thinks it'd be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. 

Two things before we proceed:

1. Our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.

2. While it's apparently weird, I despise peanut butter, not that I'm allergic or anything, but I really hate the stuff.

Knowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else I'm going to get pranked to no end over it) I decide we should just get it over with now.

So my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says ""get to scooping"" while he laughs in my face

Once He's made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. Here's where my fuckup begins:

I drink coffee often, so I'm not very careful about it being hot, and assume it's much MUCH cooler than my typical coffee as I heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before I drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and Seeing as I'm not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, I try to slam it down as fast as possible.

Actually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up MUCH faster than a typical liquid, It's VERY thick and Insanely sticky. It was like Satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and I couldn't get it out. My friend is still laughing his ass of and I'm screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and I begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. At this level I'm thinking ""I'm choking on lava"" and ""I really hope I don't die because of the one time I eat peanut butter""

I go for the milk we have in the fridge so I can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking A1 sauce, so I grab the sprayer in the kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but I can already tell that I've got some pretty severe burns.

Flash forward to the Hospital, and Thanks to my idiocy I have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and After almost a week, I'm still in constant pain. I can't taste anything except pain, I have burns on and around my tongue, my gums The roof of my mouth, my throat, and Can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.

FML, and Fuck peanut butter. Never drink it, or you'll end up like me.


TL;DR: Got dared to drink melted peanut butter. Slammed it down to avoid Taste. Hot peanut butter is Basically Napalm and Hot PB + Mouth = Second Degree Burns.",tifu
"[TX] My apartment complex in a college town was advertised as a ""gated community"". In the last 3 months I've lived here, the gates have never been closed and now a resident has been robbed at gunpoint on site. Is there anything we can do?","**SEE EDIT**


Most of the info is in the title. My complex specifically advertises itself as a gated community, has 2 entrance gates and a guard booth between them. Since I moved in in august I have NEVER seen the gates closed or a guard/employee posted in the booth, despite many emails warning that after the first month the gates would be closed and a permit would be required to enter.

I had this exact same issue at my last apartment and it bothered me, but I had so many other issues with it it was comparatively NBD.

Now one of the residents of my complex has alerted everybody that a few nights ago he was robbed at gunpoint outside his building. Another resident said that this new no-closing the gate activity is relatively new (within the last 6 months) and hes never felt more unsafe than now. And to clarify, we're talking ""random dude with a gun wandering the complex"" mugging not ""weird guy he knew went crazy and pointed a gun at him"" mugging.

The question really boils down to this, if a complex advertises itself as a ""gated community"" (this is still on their website on the main page), do they actually have any requirements in terms of actually USING the gates?

EDIT: apparently multiple people have already began their crusade against the complex, as they just sent an email out to everyone claiming the gates will be closing every night starting tonight",legaladvice

Teachers should not be allowed to express their political opinions in school.,"Bit of context for this. When I was 16 (in 2006) I studies politics in the UK. Both my teachers supported Labour as did almost all of the class, but that isn't the issue. The issue came about when I made a prediction that the Conservatives would win the next general election (they did). Now, this wasn't me declaring any support for either party. It was literally just an observation. My teacher then went on to explain how bad the Conservative party is, how everybody in the class should vote Labour and that I was a 'Tory boy'. Basically for the next two years my opinions and views in class were null and void because, and I quote, ""don't listen to the Tory Boy"". Also, other classmates who had different opinions to the class and teachers aligned with them to make sure they didn't get the same vitriol thrown their way.

To be clear, I have no issue with teachers telling student's who they voted for. I do take issue when they seek to impose their opinions on the class. They're there to educate. Not dictate.

"AITA for telling my best friend ""are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?"" or did I say it in front of the wrong group of people?","Some back story. I'm white, my best friend since middle school is a black dude named Rob. I'm not a white guy who says ""I have lots of black friends"" because I don't, but Rob and I have been thick as thieves since we went to Jr nationals for wrestling. I literally love the guy like a brother.

We are in second semester of freshman year at our state university. Since we both hope to apply to professional grad schools, we've been searching around for community service groups in order to make contacts, get experience and maybe even help the community. We both volunteered for a veterans service organization where we go around and make sure that elderly veterans have thier basic services covered and aren't living in a dirty house. So far it's been kind of a waste of time because everyone we check has thier shit together and seem to resent us as busy bodies. Whatever, the leader of this group thinks she's saving the world and Rob and I are gong to stick it out to spring break and then find something else.

So the group had this dinner on Wednesday night at a restaurant and we went because, why not free food. I have no idea what Robs deal was but I looked across the table and Rob was cutting and eating his hamburger with a knife and fork. I about died laughing because it looked so ridiculous and I had no idea what he was doing and I've eaten meals with him thousands of times and I've never seen him do such a thing. It was hysterically funny.

So I looked at him and I said ""hey Rob are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?""  Rob literally laughed so hard that he coughed up the piece in had in his mouth. We say stuff like this to each other all the time. 

But the reaction from everyone else was the most ridiculous ""clutch the pearls"" shocked white people reaction you've ever seen. I may as well have shot Rob in the face. I was scolded by the head of of the volunteer group in person, while literally every other person present came over to Rob to make sure he was ""OK.""  I knew I fucked up but as we were leaving we got a huge laugh about it and Rob told me that some of the cuter volunteer chicks might actually feel sorry for him enough to have sex with him. I thought it was over and done with.

Well yesterday director lady sent out a group email talking about the ""horrors of racism"" and how words have power and how racism must be ripped out by its roots wherever we see it and at the end she said ""u/Monsterof will be apologizing to the entire group at Friday's meeting."" Not apologizing to Rob who my joke was directed towards...but apparently to the group of angry white peoples who were sleepless over the mean words (not directed at them) I said to my best friend ok the planet.

Again, Rob and I got a big laugh but I'm really pissed she said I WOULD be apologizing when I hadn't even been consulted yet. I think I should just quit and leave her hanging. Rob wants me to get up there and make a mockery of her apology but I don't even want to do that. 

Not necessarily looking for advice because I have until 3 when the meeting starts, but am looking for am I the asshole or not?


Edit: well group meeting came and went. They didn't want to allow Rob into the meeting to hear the apology lest he have to hear the offending words again or some such absolute horseshit, Rob's a pretty chill dude but I think that really bothered him. We didn't make a huge scene like I guess we could of, we both basically said ""no thank you"" and we'll take our services elsewhere. Rob says hello...",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for forbidding my Father in law from seeing my kids until he stops his behavior,"My father in law is the king of passive aggressive comments and passing judgement on other people's lives. He particularly disapproves of the fact that I work, send the kids to daycare, and expect my husband to contribute to the household equally in spite of the fact that he makes more than I do. If my father in law had it his way, I would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

His recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. If I buy my husband a gift, FIL says, ""Is it really a gift if you're spending his money?"" If I pay for my FIL's coffee, he says, ""well, really your husband is paying for this."" It's annoying and frustrating. I tried being snarky back, didn't work. I tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what I was talking about.

The final straw was that my kids have started saying it. I mentioned to my husband that I was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing. My husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time! Apparently he's taken to telling the kids behind my back that I'm wasting my husband's money on myself every time that I buy anything for myself. One of my kids straight up called me greedy and selfish.

I'm livid and I want to ban my father in law from seeing my kids until he admits to what he's been doing, apologizes, and actually stops doing it. My husband is onboard for the most part, but his mother and siblings are telling us that this is just how he is and it's not that bad and we can just teach our kids otherwise. Are we assholes if we kick him out of our kids lives until he stops being such a jerk and poisoning my kids against me?",AmItheAsshole
Final Update: (Oregon) Can I sue my business partner in small claims court?,"Hello again, r/legaladvice. I understand you appreciate updates.

I posted several questions and updates throughout my saga, but [here is the (most relevant) OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/83a71m/update_question_can_i_sue_my_asshole_business/).

**The important points:**

* I was a minority shareholder in a small business in Oregon.
* I also worked in that business.
* I decided I wanted to no longer work in the business.
* The majority owner decided he didn't like that, so he ""fired"" me instead, froze me out of the bank accounts, stopped my distributions, and threatened to sue me to get back ""all the money I ever received"" from the business.

That was scary and frustrating, so I got lawyer.

**Now the update:**

After spending months trying to peacefully resolve everything and getting stonewalled, we filed a document inspection lawsuit in November to compel my partner to produce all our agreements and financial documents so we could at least understand what the heck he was doing and to figure out just how bad he was screwing me.

My lawyer (who's practiced for 30+ years) said he's never had to file an inspection suit before because, in Oregon, it comes with attorney fees. No one allows themselves to be sued for that because it's a big liability.

My partner dodged service for 2 months, so we weren't able to get the ball rolling until January. He had a lawyer this whole time, but they never agreed to accept service.

And then... more stonewalling. We ended up filing notice of intent to take default. The next day, they filed an answer to the suit denying everything and countersuing for attorney fees (which, apparently, they can't actually get).

In March, my lawyer's assistant was doing some routine research and just happened to find that the business filed amended documents with the state that completely omitted me as a member / owner.

He was trying to erase me.

My lawyer decided the best thing to do was to continue the inspection suit and file a new suit naming my partner personally for breach of fiduciary duty. That way, he could try to do as much useful discovery as possible under the inspection suit where we could get attorney fees back and use all that discovery again in the individual suit where we couldn't.

This is also the point at which he offered to represent me on contingency, which was a huge relief for me because he's expensive and things were escalating. He also credited the fees I'd already paid towards future costs/expenses, which helped a lot.

Even though the other side was making no effort to resolve the problem, that really felt like a positive turning point because I think getting a lawyer on contingency for a business / contract dispute is pretty unusual.

I later learned my lawyer offered contingency because my partner pissed him off and he wanted to keep turning the screws on him. He didn't want me to bail. I get the impression he's getting towards the end of his career and just likes to work on cases that interest him now.

Fast forward a few months, and we depose my partner. That experience pissed my lawyer off even more. I wasn't there, but reading the transcript was both sad and hilarious. My lawyer said it was the ""3rd most frustrating deposition"" he's ever taken. Oh well, guess you can't be 1st at everything.

After the deposition, partner's attorney got in touch to offer a settlement (he was on his 3rd lawyer at this point, btw).

It was a terrible offer so we said ""no thanks, but we'll do mediation if you want.""

They agreed, which is tragically comical to me. Mediation was my *partner's idea* that *I agreed* to before any of this insanity ever started. But he changed his mind at the last minute and I never heard from him again.

We spent a FULL day in mediation and, at the end, accepted a ""mediated settlement"" when negotiations broke down.

The settlement, once the contingency fee was subtracted, was not far from what I thought I was owed, so I was happy to accept it and put an end to an emotionally draining 2-year saga.

I often second guessed myself throughout this process and felt guilty for suing someone I once cared so much about but, really, he brought it upon himself. And I'm happy that I stood up for myself and am not spending the rest of my life asking, ""Why did I let him get away with that?"" 

My ex-partner has a very strong cult of personality that's served him well—he's very charming and can convince most people to do what he wants. I don't think anyone's ever stood up to him like that before, and it caught him flat footed.

The whole process was confusing because he never made a logical move until he was truly backed into a corner and was facing trial. At every turn, I wondered, ""Is this a trap? Do they have some epic strategy I can't see?""

The longer things dragged on, the more I realized they didn't. There was no strategy beyond ignoring me until they couldn't anymore.

Though my bank account is much healthier today, I have to say the money really rings hollow. I lost a friend and a partner in this debacle. But it was obvious I was going to lose that anyway, so better to have the money than not have it I guess! 

And I'm very thankful I found the lawyer I did. I probably could not have sustained the fight all the way through trial without a contingency agreement. I could tell he really loved his job and I think he's a little bummed we're not going to trial.",legaladvice
I (36M) think my wife of 8 years (31F) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42M),"Throw away for obvious reasons.

So my wife and I have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  At first it's good and we start communicating better.  

About three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". Alone.

Around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

She starts telling her friends about ""Danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""Dr. Soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""Danny"".  (I don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

Around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.

There have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.

About a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.

When she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know Jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

I think I'm going to confront them in the session this Thursday.",relationship_advice

TIFU By being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. NSFW,"Well, this didn't happen today. But it's a funny story that I couldn't share with reddit at the time.

Rewind back to me at 14 years old. Awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

As such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

One night, to avoid watching TV with my Dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, I claimed that I had ""homework"" to do. Of course, this was a lie. I just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

So I fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

Now this is where things went wrong. I got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

You see, my bedroom was upstairs and I had no door. A sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my Dad, his Wife, and her two kids were watching TV. 

The desktop was right next to the staircase, but I figured that the TV was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. I was right.

But what I didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

I also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

I eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

And that's when I turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that I was casting a giant Shadow Puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. A perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. And I had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

So I did what anyone would do in that situation. I put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until I heard the TV come back on. Then I went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

No one ever brought it up. And I'm thankful. But I know what they saw. And I'm still cringing.

Tl;dr: Got horny. Got stupid. Projected a Masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. Still embarrassed.

Edit: Well shit. Glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

TIFU by blowing my man too enthusiastically [NSFW],"This happened the past night, technically already today.

We were having some adult fun with the boyfriend. It was also after a couple of drinks so we were going at it pretty rough.
So here I am, on my knees, giving him a blowjob, putting my back into it when all of a sudden I hear a very loud *POP* immediately followed by one of the worst pain I ever felt. It felt as if someone stabbed me in the face with a screwdriver. 

Thanks to my godlike reflexes I was able to yank my head away from the one eyed yogurt slinger before my teeth snapped together and with that momentum I also managed to slam my head into the nearest wall. I was already in tears from the shock of the sudden pain when I realised.. I can't move my jaw. I started to panic and just kept repeating ""I can't open my mouth! I can't open my mouth!"".

We tried to pry it open while under hot water, thinking it was a muscle cramp but that shortly, with some pain I can't even start to describe, revealed that it indeed was not just some stiff muscle... 

Yup, I managed to dislocate my jaw while giving a blowjob.

In a futile attempt to snap it back where it belongs, I tried punching myself in the face on the opposite side, tried pushing it, pulling it with all my might but none of that seemed to work. At the end after many tears and pain and panicked running in circles, I took a painkiller and wrapped myself in a blanket to think through my options. I ended up falling asleep like that for a few hours. 

When I woke again, with the pain a bit duller and my mind a bit clearer I finally managed to pop my jaw back where it belongs but the pain is still very bad and I can't open my mouth more then to fit a teaspoon neither can I close it completely. It being Sunday, only emergency trauma care is accessible in the hospital and it is insanely crowded so I decided to wait till tomorrow to seek medical attention. So here I am now, popping painkillers and eating my dinner with a straw, having absolutely no idea what I am going to say to the doctor or how do I explain to my boss why I need a day off in such short notice.

Tl,Dr: i went for a blowjob, ended up like the T-Rex after King Kong was done with it.

EDIT/UPDATE: first of all... Holy sh** this blew up! I'm glad I could make so many of you chuckle. Also, I've read the comments, thanks for the laughs, it hurt.

To answer a couple topics I found in the comments: sadly, nobody came that day. 

What was boyfriend doing, well, he tried to call an ambulance after he realised we are not equipped to fix the issue. Problem is, my country is not very big on English and my boyfriend doesn't speak the local language. First operator hang up on him when realised he is trying to communicate in English, second operator got stuck on not understanding the address code in English... I then insisted to ""f**k that, it'll be fine"".

I am not from the us, just very stupid. Health care is included in taxes but did not rush to the ER because they are under staffed, under payed and over worked an I was not bleeding, seriously disabled or in mortal danger, neither did I think a dislocated jaw is serious enough to require immediate care, tho reading your horror stories and warnings made me concerned.

After a brief ~4 hours spent at the clinic I was called into a large room where five dentists were working on five different patients with not as much as a curtain separating them so the place was loud enough that the doctor did not ask questions because I was not able to answer loud enough. He instructed me to grip the chair tight because it will hurt, pushed my jaw backwards and wiggled it to it's place. Showed me how to stretch the muscles, gave me his number and sent me off.

Hopefully it will heal alright and I can go back to finish what I was doing originally.

AITA for not accommodating a vegan guest?,"Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we've lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it's become a great tradition in our social circle. 

Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.

During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn't push the issue. 

However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don't agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don't have anything against her dietary choices, but I don't believe it's fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

Me, my wife and my (16 year old)son live in an apartment, so we share the bathroom. He always took long showers(30 minutes or so), but lately he's been taking it too far. He gets in bathroom for an hour, two hours. 

Last straw was few days ago when stayed there for 3.5 HOURS. That's just not reasonable in my opinion. I told him that he wouldn't lock the door from now on and if he took longer than 40 minutes I'd walk in. He's not happy about it.

My wife thinks I'm being too strict and not respecting his privacy.


More info: he has his own room and he can lock door any time he wants, so he has privacy. I've talked to him multiple times and he just ignores me. He also doesn't take his phone in there(some of you suggested that I turn off wifi while he's in there).

I was waiting for a minute or two, waiting for oncoming traffic to cease when along he came, on his way home, driving in auto-pilot, neglecting to see a bike that isn't on his radar to notice. There were 6 witnesses who all said that I had been waiting, and was there long before he was. The one witness who saved my ass left a voice note on his phone detailing everything he witnessed, that I had been waiting. That he expected the car to stop, To swerve. I got unlucky.

Got robbed at Walmart by someone who I think is my coworker but management says it isn't and implied my job is in jeopardy,"Posted this on /r/walmart and was suggested to put it here as well.  

Tried posting as a throwaway but guess it was too new, and wouldn't show up. This is a side account I randomly created years ago.

I am an autistic special needs janitor at a wal mart in PA.   
The other day as I was going to my car (I was off) just buying some food. A coworker calls me by my name outside the front doors. He starts talking to me and walks to my car with me. He said he wants to ask me a question and opens my car and gets in.

At this point he starts freaking out that he needs money and makes me give him all the money in my wallet, and then tried to get me to drive to a gas station to use my debit card. Now I am tiny, autistic, with bad motor skills from a head injury. He is the 2nd biggest person that works in the store. I would of been no match if he tried anything.

In the car he demanded my phone number so he contact me later. He called the number I gave to make sure it was the correct number. Thus me at this point acquiring his number.

The next day before work I receive 5 missed calls in a half hour from his number, telling me to meet him in private. I go file a report with the police and give them all the info, investigator said he would call the number I gave him to get him to stop harassing me as well.

When I got to work I file a report with management with the same info and they promise they would investigate ASAP!

Fast forward the investigator gets back to me and said a girl picked up the phone and he asked to speak my coworker and they said okay and put him on the phone. He responded to all the cops questions as the name I gave admitting he took the money but would give it back. The investigator also tells me no charges can be filed cause I handed the money over in fear and not it being snatched out of my own hands. I have been advised to appeal that to the state police btw.

Management talked to me today and an assistant who is not AP said he did the investigation and determined it was not who I said it but someone who looked exactly almost 100% like the person who I accused. Who happened to know my name, and who happened to respond to my coworkers name. They wont show me the footage. Also they casually decided to inform me I got followed by a car he got in after he got out of my car.

Now the manager is implying my job could be in jeopardy for wrongly accusing a person who even he said looked exactly like the person I said it was

Heads up this situation has gotten out to the rest of the store (Not surprising)

Any advice on this situation?

TIFU by having my son clean his room.,"To start off this is my wife's story and  it happened at the beginning of the year. 

Some back story we have 2 kids a 10 year old and a 2 year old. Why 8 years apart well me and the mrs tried having a kid for 7 years before she became pregnant.  So the 10 year old helps out a lot and is a great kid. We are truly lucky to have this child. 

Well at the beginning of the year the two year old had started to potty train him self. Telling us he had to go potty and then going potty. So we get him some pull ups and start that phase. We also have a 3 bedroom home and the boys share a room (the 10 year olds idea not mine). 

Cue the day of said FU. The 2 year old had been playing in their room just out of ear shot of the wife. She would check on him every few minutes just to make sure he was all right. Well he comes to her and says (we think) mommie slim yucky. 

Oh no my wife thinks and calls for the oldest. Hey, oldest the 2 year old got into your slime can you clean It up for me while I make lunch. So the oldest goes into the room to clean it up and my wife picks up the two tear old to clean him up. It's at this time she sees the 2 year old doesn't have his pull up on, and after a few minutes my oldest calls out, ""Mom! Can slime go bad?"" She walks into the room to she my 10 year old trying to clean up a huge pile of runny poo that is all over the floor with his bare hands. 

So after a few screams and laughs from my wife she tells him to go take a hot shower and she cleans the mess her self. Then let's him play on the switch for the rest of the day. 

Tldr: 10 year old tries to clean up runny poo with hands thinking it was slime.

Edit. Holy shit ( no pun intended) this blew up. You guys have me in tears laughing on my lunch break. Thanks so much. 

But to answer a question or statement I have gotten in dms. No my oldest doesn't baby sit but does help out around the house. Keeping his toys picked up and out of reach of the little one. Normally he does a great job. Is just one of said responsibilities.

Edit #2 got gold? Thanks it means a lot. You guys have made my day. 

Also my wife and kids did this DIY slime thing and at one part you add food coloring to make it the color you want. My son made his brown. Cause he added multiple colors. So when the little one runs in saying slime yucky it wasn't a weird thing and he has gotten into it  before. My oldest wasn't playing in it. He was trying to clean it up.  And the whole thing was over the span of a few minutes. So he wasn't in there for that long trying to clean it up. 

And I forget not everyone knows things. But if you google Slime it should clear up confusion.",tifu

TIFU By applying for engineering jobs and telling employers I'm retarded,"So this has been going on since I graduated in May and started applying for jobs. I've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and I have not had much feedback. Well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since I have ADHD, I have been checking the box marked ""Intellectual Disability"" all these months. 


So about fifteen minutes ago I'm going through an application like normal and I get to the part where they ask about disabilities. This is what it reads: ""Intellectual Disability (formerly described as mental retardation)"". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that I've been applying for jobs that I really want and I have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. I don't deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.

UPDATE: My [30m] Wife [30f] lied to me about where she was.,"Me again. I was asked for updates by a lot of you to this situation and for the most part everyone is really kind and helpful and I can't tank you all enough. Not a lot has changed but there is more and more that add to my suspicion that my wife is cheating on me, details below. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aimwwu/my_30_m_wife_30_f_lied_to_me_about_where_she_was


I went out of town this past weekend on a work trip leaving my wife alone for a few nights, something I wasn't looking forward given my suspicions. I decided not to confront her about it and just collect more evidence, if I found nothing I would just ask here where she was on MLK day but if I found more I'd rather her not know I know.

Wednesday night she was supposed to go to the library and then to the gym right after just like on Monday, but when I got home from work she was already back at the house. I asked her why she skipped on the plans for the day and she just said ""oh I changed my mind, just staying in tonight."" It is pretty rare of her to miss a gym night anyway and when she does it's usually for a more substantial reason. Anyway, the rest of the week went as normal as can be expected and I left Friday night for my trip.

We didn't talk much over the weekend, just a phone call here or there and the occasional text, but I did have my friend run by my house just to see if anyone was home, strange car in the driveway, etc. He knew the situation and was happy to make a small drive over. He said her car wasn't there Saturday evening when he drove by and when he passed our house on the way to church the next morning it wasn't there as well. Before all you sleuths ask, yes we have a garage but it's packed with Christmas decorations that I haven't put away yet, she parks outside for now. We also all go to the same church and my friend said she wasn't there either. 

Last night I got home and the house looked exactly like how I left it. No dishes used, no takeout bags or boxes, even the bed looked how I remember leaving it. It doesn't look like she was at the house all weekend. When I asked her how her weekend went she just smiled and said ""relaxing"", and that's all.

No smoking gun, just a lot more ""that doesn't sound/look good"" kind of moments. I know it's not the dramatic update you all were looking for but it's what I got... Till next time I guess.",relationship_advice
AITA for not wanting to pick up my wife from the airport at 12:30 AM?,"Backstory: My wife is coming back from a four day business trip. Her flight is just under three hours, and she will be landing around 12:30 AM. Airport is about 30 mins away from our home. She generally hates flying in this late, and asked if I could come pick her up from the airport (**To clarify:** the airport is O'Hare. It's a huge, busy airport. There are hundreds of business travelers coming through even at 1 AM, and a huge fleet of taxis / ubers standing by to take them home. If this was a little airport and she was waiting by herself for a taxi for 20 mins, you would not be reading this post. As much as people are sensitive to it, safety is realistically not a huge issue here.)

I have to get up early and commute to work the next morning, and wouldn't be getting home until 1-1:30 AM. I get why she wants me to come, and I know it would be the good thing to do..... but I also feel like she'd be completely fine just taking a taxi this one time...

(Texas) Power of attorney seems fishy?,"So, I'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time I try to, they threaten me with this. I do have mental disabilities, however I am fully functional and I also have never been diagnosed. This leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. I do remember my parents dragging me into an SSA office when I was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. They just told me to sign it without question and being my parents I didn't think to question them. Later they told me that I had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. Every time I try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since I'm disabled and I have no guardianship over myself, whoever I go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. I'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. They tell me I'm crazy and helpless and I can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

&#x200B;

Other things that might be important that make my question things:

They don't care about my well being. They don't allow me to go to therapy even when I've asked. They refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when I finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. I know for sure I do have a mental disability, I just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. They've always been controlling and I wonder if this is just another method. I get too scared to call Suicide Hotline when I'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" I've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and I have a hard time seeking help. I feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200B;

Anyways, how do I go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? What are their rights if this is true? What are my rights? Can I, I guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? What can I do about this?

&#x200B;

Is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that I haven't thought about asking for? Can I do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? Can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

I am the plaintiff in a slip and fall case in Pennsylvania. Back in January of 2015, I slipped and fell on an untreated ice-covered sidewalk, causing several severe hernias in my spine. I've been in and out of a wheelchair, depending on how the hernia has shifted over time, as well as dealing with excruciating pain, physical therapy, steroid injections, and heavy pain meds. My doctor finally decided, after four years, that back surgery couldn't be avoided, so I got it scheduled, and called my lawyer to let them know.

I had an arbitration hearing two weeks after my surgery, which my lawyer told me that he was going to have postponed, to give me a chance to heal a bit. My lawyer's office called me the night before my hearing that was supposed to be rescheduled to remind me about said hearing. I tried telling them that the hearing was supposed to be rescheduled, but they were just a receptionist, and my lawyer was unreachable at the time. I went to the hearing anyway, because otherwise, the court could have thrown out my case, and I couldn't reach anyone before the hearing because the law office didn't open until an hour after my hearing began.

At the hearing, I found out that not only had my lawyer failed to postpone the hearing, he also failed to notify the opposing counsel that I had just had surgery, leading to the fact that I had surgery being thrown out as evidence, severely hurting my case.

I just got a letter from my lawyer's office, telling me that they petitioned the court to drop me as a client, which the court allowed. Now I'm stuck without a lawyer, with an important fact in my case unable to even be mentioned. Is there anything I can do to salvage this, or am I totally screwed because my lawyer messed up?",legaladvice

AITA for wanting my step dad to replace my laptop with a new £2000 one?,"Throwaway because I have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.

I (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, I splurged on a £2000 ($2600) HP Spectre with the highest specs. I treasured the laptop, it was my baby. I used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.

Now, my step dad is a horrible person. He's always complaining about what I spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so I wouldn't be able to spend so much money. He's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that I paid a lot for.

I should also mention that I don't live with him, so what I spend my money on makes no difference to him.

Anyway, I've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. I don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. I could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. When my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear I deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. He's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.

My mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. I'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).

However, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over £500. I understand that £2000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and I spent so long saving. I've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less I will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. My whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.

So, I know I'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. But am I for accepting nothing less as a replacement?

EDIT: I just want to say thank you guys so much for all the well wishes and advice. Let me clear a few things up as well:

\- unfortunately, the laptop is snapped in half by my whale of a step parent, so there's no chance of repairs

\- also, I know I'm not TA for asking for the replacement, I just know how much my family will struggle to pay me back this amount and my main concern is whether I'm wrong to do that to the rest of them :(",AmItheAsshole

TIFU By Being a Bored Pre-Teen on a Hot Summer Day," 

Obligatory this happened many years ago, sometime in the mid-90s when I was 11 or 12. When I was growing up I had a tendency to initially fall in with friends more for the entertainment value than for the bond of friendship, which led to some lifelong friendships as a result of zany shared experiences and also some extremely poor decisions. As you might imagine, this story falls into the latter category.

One my closest friends at the time was an only child whose parents were mostly absentee, as they had him unexpectedly when they were in their 40's and didn't really have the energy to chase him around. As an alternative, they basically attempted to buy his love by giving him a generous allowance and mostly looking the other way as he did whatever he wanted, which mostly meant wreaking havoc around our small suburban neighborhood. I became close friends with him mainly because my parents would drop me off and his parents would leave us alone, so we could chill out in the basement of his house and watch R-rated movies like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Heat.

That was far from the weirdest stuff this kid had accrued, however - we're talking he had a shoebox full of floppy disks with odd porn (e.g. Wizard of Oz, and yes Toto was there but thankfully just watched), tons of cardboard cutouts he'd swipe from the local video store and his prized possession, a chrome -plated M1911 cap gun with a black handgrip and the orange tip painted chrome to look more ""genuine"". With all this and all the video game systems popular at the time and even a computer connected to the primitive (at the time) internet, this kid's house was an absolute playground for a middle school kid like me with time to kill. One fateful hot July afternoon, my parents dropped me off at his house and the fun began.

As I sauntered up his driveway, the first thing I saw was my friend with a dark red gas can (the kind that holds a gallon or two of gasoline for a push mower or other household gas-powered tool) looking down at what seemed to be a ceramic vase. This couldn't end well... so of course I had to go take a look!

""Hey man, what're you up to?""

""I'm making some homemade napalm. I heard from Charlie at school that if you mix a bunch of styrofoam peanuts with gasoline, it'll all mix together and burn for HOURS man. This is gonna be sweet!""

""Are you sure that's a good idea?"" I started to step back, as I knew where this was going. Just a few weeks before this my friend had ignited a whole pack of matches and nearly burned down his neighbor's house when the matches burned his hand.

""FUCK yeah man, don't be a goddamn pussy."" As he says this, he lights up a match, stands back a step and casually tosses it into the vase like one of those movie heroes throwing a match or a zippo into a trail of gasoline leading to the bad guys. Needless to say, the reaction was more than we anticipated - immediately a tsunami of hellfire came bursting out the mouth of the vase like the exhaust from a jet engine, the tips of the flames licking the gutters of the house. We both just stood there in awe, unable to move - I was thinking we are fucking definitely going to jail for this.

Thankfully, my friend's parents were out and I'm guessing the neighbors were out running errands or something too, as no one called the police or the fire department and gradually the flames reduced down to embers. I have no idea how the vase didn't bust apart from the extreme heat and pressure - I just couldn't believe we had gotten away with it.

By this time I wanted to be anywhere but at the house, as I was still obsessed with the idea that somehow the FBI or something would show up and lock us up forever for endangering the whole neighborhood. After some cajoling, my friend agreed to go down the hill to the Mr. Cookie to grab a bite to eat, but before we ventured out he said, ""Hold on, I need to go grab something."" He ran inside and came back outside a minute later grinning from ear to ear. I didn't even want to know what he had done, so I just shook my head and started walking, hoping we'd be able to settle down and relax in front of a movie or something for the rest of the afternoon.

The walk down the hill proceeds fairly uneventfully, and I'm breathing a sigh of relief thinking we were out of the woods as we arrive in front of the Mr. Cookie. As I'm about to walk in, my friend says, ""Hey man, one minute, I wanna try something."" I start to turn around, and as I do he grabs me around the neck, presses my body to his like a human shield, grabs the chrome-plated cap gun from his pocket and points it at my head. ""None of you punk bitches better move, or I'mma execute this muthafucka!!!"" My friend screamed this at the top of his lungs to our fellow pedestrians, which included an elderly grandma with a shopping cart, a soccer mom with two kids and a police officer who happened to just be pulling in front of the Mr. Cookie at that moment.

The women and children screamed and scattered, the soccer mom using her body to shield her kids, throw them into her minivan and speed off into traffic, swerving wildly and almost clipping a passing Toyota. The police office jumps out of his car and immediately draws his gun, using his vehicle as cover. ""DROP THE GUN!!!""

My friend didn't anticipate this turn of events, and yet he doubled down, probably because he's seen way to many crime thrillers and had more or less waiting his entire life for a situation like this. ""You drop the gun, PIG, or I'll paint the goddamn sidewalk with this kid's brains!"" At this point I was on the verge of fainting from panic, and with my eyes starting to roll back into my head the world slowed down and got fuzzy. As my body started to go limp, my friend finally got a little bit concerned or at least distracted, tossing the gun down on the ground so he could catch me on my way down. The cop took this opportunity to rush in and tackle my friend to the pavement, and I remember hearing a wet smack.

As I start to come to, I'm sitting on the curb with my hands cuffed behind my back next to my friend, who is bleeding from his scalp and crying. Long story short, the cops took us down to the station to book us as if we were adults (mainly to scare the shit out of us, successfully) and released us to our parents. I'm not sure if there were more long-term consequences for my friend, as I had enough at that point and never spoke to him again, but thankfully my friend admitted that it was all his idea and corroborated my story as just being the victim. I did look him up a few years ago just to see what he was up to these days, and it seems he owns a small construction company with the word ""Reliable"" in the title. That one gave me a good chuckle.

UPDATE: My brother decided to end his life..,"Hi, I would like the mods of reddit to delete this post after 2 weeks or so. I just feel the need inform all of you since you showed much interest.

As you see from title, my brother decided to end his life two days ago. I am his older brother, I am 23 years old while he was 20. That day, when he posted on reddit, he came to my house (I live in another city), and he decided to stay. We had a long talk, and I was trying to make him feel better, even though that was a hard thing to do. He also showed to me his post on reddit and told me how helpful you guys were, symphathetic and what not.

Unfortunately the loss of his girlfriend completely destroyed him. He lost over 10 kgs in just approximately 1 month, he was simply refusing to eat, only a few meals here and there, and even though after some point he decided to seek for professional help, as you also guys suggested him, that didn't help him at all. I was trying my best. Until the day he decided to do that he was living in my house, he took a huge break from University so he could focus on healing himself. 

Two days ago I was at work, and he was at home, as always. When I came back I saw something that I hope none of you ever experience in your lives.. He hanged himself. It hurts me saying that. It was rather unexpected. Even though lately he was showing some warning signs to me, I never thought he would actually do that. About a week ago he decided to stop going to the psychologist that was taking care of him, and when I asked him for the reason, he said ""it's just not needed anymore"".

Right next to his dead body there was a letter, and he actually said a bunch of things.He thanked my parents, me, and everyone who was supporting him till the last moment. Even you guys. He said he was sorry and his last words were ""tell mum and dad I love them. I can't keep up with this anymore. I am sorry. I love you"".

I tried my best all those weeks to cheer him up, to go out with him and make him feel better, but he would always refuse. I don't blame him. Losing someone you truly love and are in a relationship with for 7 years is not an easy thing. Even more when you see that person getting killed right in front of you. I am in a complete shock, life was unfair to my brother, and he unfortunately couldn't make it. We were always so close to each other, and he was an amazing brother, an amazing person. It really sucks to say the least. I soemtimes feel it's my fault. 

I felt the need to inform all of you since he posted here a couple of weeks ago and got a huge feedback. I want to say a big thanks on behalf of my brother and from me aswell. You guys are amazing.

Thanks once again.

P.S: A few comments here are saying how this is fake, a made up story. If you think that's the case then it's ok. I am not here to argue or try to persuade any of you, but to rather inform you because a couple here showed much interest and genuinely tried to help my bro. Sucks to say but things like this do happen, and experiencing such is awful.

AITA for telling my parents I won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?,"I'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

They said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.

I'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.

Anyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open

My friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

Right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

So I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

And that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

AITA for smacking the shit out of my 8-year-old nephew for stealing hundreds of dollars of my Pokemon cards and taking some of them to school and trading with them?,"Little bit of backstory: I really enjoy Pokémon and play competitively in tournaments and open a shit ton of packs. Doing this means I have a very large collection of valuable cards. I still love at my parents house (I'm 18), and I keep them all on a shelf in my room. My nephew is 8, almost 9 and he and my niece is living with us because my sister abandoned them for some druggie on the streets. 

Anyway, a few days ago I got home from work and was wanting to edit one of the decks I had built for the tournament later in the day. I go to pick up a few deck boxes and a binder and found that one of my binders, and 3 of 9 deck boxes were missing. I immediately freak out because I have them all very organized and well-kept. My nephew has **a lot** of behavioral issues and gets in a lot of trouble both at home and school. He also isn't ever really disciplined because it would make the situation worse(you'd understand if you met him and my family). So I go into his room to look for them. Lo and behold, there they are, scattered all over the floor, most of them taken out of sleeves, some bent, some of them was thrown in his backpack—oh and my binder was completely empty. At this point I was *beyond* furious and all I could mutter was "" Oh my God"" over and over. 

After I pick everything up that I could find, I go upstairs and casually bring him back down to his room and then start screaming at him, and demanding him to find the rest of them. He kept saying he didn't do it and he didn't steal them, that they were in his room when he woke up and he thought they were his (keep in mind he lies about *everything*). So I get even madder if that's possible and I smack the shit out of his leg. Then he starts screaming bloody murder and my nstep dad comes down and demands to know what's going on. I couldn't even get a word out before the child went up to him and said I was trying to kill him. My nstep dad coddles him and then gets in my face and threatens to beat me to death if I ever lay another finger on him. 

After they question him for about an hour, he finally admits that he took them to school and was trading and giving them away with his classmates. His punishment: a stern warning and no tv for the night (which he screamed and cried over). He also said he hates me and wished I would just move out and die. My parents then berated me for a while and essentially told me that I'm a child abuser and if I did that again they would have to call the police and have me charged with assault (mostly my nstep dad saying this, my mom understood what I did and didn't make it a big deal). All in all I recovered most of the cards losing about 20 out of 250, but with all of the damage that was done to some of the cards I probably lost about $180 of cards. 

So am I the asshole in this situation? Was I overreacting by disciplining him because my parents don't? I get that it's not my place to do that, but I completely think that it was deserved and I honestly feel that I should've smacked him again. He goes back to school today and I have already contacted his teacher and explained the situation; thankfully, she's going to confiscate every Pokémon card she finds and let me come in after hours to find which ones are mine. Sorry for the lengthy post but I needed to vent my frustrations. AITA? 

TLDR: nephew went in my room and stole approximately 250 valuable cards while I was working; I get home and find out and I smack the shit out of him. Then I'm threatened to be killed/ be turned into the police for assault the next time I put my hands on him. 

Edit: holy shit my inbox

nStepdad means narcissistic stepdad which is a term from /r/raisedbynarcissists

We should stop the women AND children first mentality.,"I do think children should go first when it comes to things but women shouldn't go first just because they are a woman. And this goes for anything, food, shelter, going first in line. Whatever it doesn't matter. This is mainly pertaining shelter and natural disaster type situations though. It's always women and children first. Adult women are not more valuable than an adult male and should be seen as easily replaceable. Men should not have to go last just because they are a man and history says women come first with that stuff.  It's harmful to the ""everyone is equal"" movement that has been going on for the best several years.

My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea,"This is my throwaway account because she know my main account. My son is 5. About 2 days ago we were out shopping and ran into a high school friend of hers. She was catching up when she told her friend that we had a son. When the old friend asked his name my wife hesitated and I told her. She had a strange look on her face then said you mean like your ex boyfriend. Our sons name is very unique to the point that I've never met another person with the same name. Now she refuses to talk to me about it. I feel betrayed and disgusted with her. It's like a switch was flipped my mind and I just can't look at her the same way. 











Update 1. Lots of questions so I'll go ahead and answer a few that have been mentioned a few times. I'm not giving out my son's name. When we discussed the name I had no idea it was her high school ex's name. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who's name was never told to me and their relationship lasted around two years. I'm upset but that doesn't automatically make make me abusive. I would never raise my hand to my wife or anyone else I care about. I will always love my son and I would never and I mean never treat him any differently. I will post an update when I talk to her probably in a day or two




Update 2. So to get some things out of the way first. The kid is mine. I have very pronounced features that he also has plus her ex was black and I'm white. I'm not  going to ""throw him away"" as so many comments suggested. When we were deciding on the name she said she remembered somebody from school who had it and instantly loved it. My wife and I both had a very promiscuous past before we met and agreed that the past should stay there so I didn't push to hard to know certain details. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who cheated on her but I never asked his name and that is my fault.

So update time. Thursday we didn't have the discussion because that is her late day at work plus this wasn't a discussion I wanted to have with our son in the house. So Thursday night when she came in I told her that Friday after work we needed to sit down and talk and if she has any plans she need to cancel. She looked very worried and said ok. Friday came and we sit down after her sister came to pick up our son for a sleep over. I asked why would not tell me where our name came from? She said she was sorry but she didn't think it was that big of a deal and I would not agree to it. I told her that it was my choice too and she took that away from me. I asked her if she would feel the same way if we had a daughter and named her after one of my ex's and she said that's different I wouldn't let that happen. She said that she knows she can disconnect the name from her ex but she wouldn't be sure I could do the same. I was floored and starting to feel sicker than I had felt. I told her that is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard come out of someone's mouth. I moved on because I had more questions and I was about to go off just on what she just said. I asked her if she still loved him and she paused for a minute then said yes but not in same way she loves me and that you don't just stop loving someone that love changes. I wanted to throw up at this point. She could see that I was very upset. She smiled at me and said I should know she only wants to be with me. I said that I needed to know how you love him. At that point she put her hand on my leg and tried to change the subject. I told her to take her fucking hand off me right now and answer the question. Her mood changed right there from wanting to move past this to no he didn't just fucking cuss at me. She said look you're upset and I get that but what is done is done so you need to get over this and move on. She got up and said I'm meeting my mom dinner I'll see you when you get home. I told her if you walk out that door then no you won't. She looked at me like I was full of shit grabbed her purse and left. I packed my bag and stayed at a friend's house last night. Right now I'm just sitting here trying to figure out what to do next.

Cheating Wives,"A guy thought his wife was cheating on him. He waited for her to leave that night and jumped in a cab to follow her. By following her, he found out she was working in a whore house.


The guy says to the cabbie, ""Wanna make a $100?""

The guy replies that all the cabbie has to do is go inside the whore house, grab his wife, put her in the back of the cab, and take them home.


The cabbie goes in. A couple of minutes later, the whore house door gets kicked open, and the cabbie starts dragging out this woman who is kicking, biting, punching, and fighting all the way to the cab.

"If you're pro-choice, then you need to support the right to assisted suicide","It's the same concept IMO. For women, it's their body and they have the right to choose whether or not to keep the child. I think the same concept should apply to suicide. If someone is miserable, depressed, chronically ill, disabled, etc, then it should be 100% their choice to end their lives. It's inhumane to force people to take their own lives using makeshift methods which can result in brain damage or permanent injury (Shotgun, nitrogen gas, etc). Obviously there should be safeguards to prevent spur of the moment suicides after a traumatic event or something, but the option for a safe, sanctioned suicide should be there after proper vetting.

Edit: 

A lot of people are agreeing and saying ""I agree with this only for terminally ill people in pain."" My entire point is that you shouldn't be able to pick and choose who gets to kill themselves.

That's like saying only rape victims or medically vulnerable mothers should be allowed to get abortions. Anyone should have access to a safe and reliable method of suicide, regardless of why they're doing it.",unpopularopinion

Splitting 50/50 after a divorce is not fair.,"Take as an example the Bezos split up. Jeff, the CEO and founder of one of if not the biggest company in the world divorced his wife, *he* was worth ~150b and after the divorce they will be splitting up 50/50 because the law in Washington (iirc that's where they live) is that everything should be split. That's not fair at all. 

This was all over the news and I don't remember anyone saying how unfair this seems. I know Jeff's wife, in this case, should've gotten a percentage because she spent basically her life with him but a 50/50 split seems way too much.

I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"It was quite by accident that I heard this.  We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon.  I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say ""Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was"" she then followed it up with ""Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there"".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there.  Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun.  I was tempted to say something like ""I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but I didn't.  I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up.  I mean fucked me up bad.  I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  At first I was angry.  Then I was humiliated.  Then I was depressed.  Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse.  I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her.  It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all.  At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly.  But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually.  None.  She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this.  It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  But no matter what I do I can't grow in size.  Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her.  She's most likely right.

Some back story here.  He dumped her.  It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  So this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here.  I can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here.  I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

EDIT:  Holy God.  I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

EDIT 2:  Dear God.  I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts.  I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens.  There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  Nope, neither of us drink.  We don't even have it in the house.
2. That I am upset she told her friend.  Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part.  I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  But the last part is just out of my control.  No matter what I do I will only ever be 7"" long.  We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. No I'm not going to do anything rash.  It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long.  It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. She is sorry that I heard it.  She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it.  It is what it is.  But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her.  Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie.  It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that. 

EDIT 3:  Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living.  She is a paralegal.  
EDIT 4:  People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken.  We met about 9 months after they separated.  I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  He just ended things so he could be with another woman.  She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it.  We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either.  After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  Obviously that was our first night together.  Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

EDIT 5:  Okay I posted it below in the mass of other posts but I have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

After that, I send him an e-mail with the cloned version through Gmail with something along the lines of: ""Look at this cool app I found on the store, it was completely free! Try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. It was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

Recently he uploaded a new app and I did the same thing as usual. I was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. I was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. I e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

About an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their Google accounts. At the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

One of my colleagues requested help and I went to check it out. It turns out that their account was blocked by Google due to ToS violations. Their Google Payments account was blocked as well. I thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. We got banned by Google, all of us. 

The afternoon was pandemonium. We were all freaking out, our IT guys were trying to get a hold of Google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. We could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. All our work was shared with Google services.

Eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. It wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. Anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. One of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

Anyways, we were all told to go home on Friday. I went home and looked this up myself, and I found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the Google Payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. It bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how I said all our work accounts were connected?

Yeah...

So it's been two days now and we've been chatting over Skype, no one knows what happened and the IT guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that Google isn't helping us out. Their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. The posts I've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since Google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

So yeah, that's that. I'm 99% sure that I am the culprit who caused this. I do not know why Google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from Google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. I might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**EDIT1:** This blew up pretty quickly. Luckily, I have 3 PMs from people close to, or reps who can help me out. If I missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. I am in touch with one of them now and I am getting in touch with IT at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. I will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out. ",tifu

"My [27M] girlfriend [25F] spent the night with another couple. I know it's over, but I don't know how to deal with it.","Last night my live-in girlfriend of 3 years spent the night with another couple. A couple that we are very close to. The other couple is married and are male and female.

&#x200B;

Over the past year or so my girlfriend has been starting to experiment with women in the form of making out, dancing, etc. Overall I was okay with this as it's somewhat of a fantasy of mine in a living-through-her-vicariously way. Since I was a kid I have been stuggling here and there with a little body dysmorphia and often fantasize about being a woman with another woman. Normally in my day to day, however, I am very comfortable in my own body. So, like I said, I wasn't against the experimenting in any way.

&#x200B;

After talking to her about it numerous times, it went from just having a good time to not being comfortable with taking things forward to maybe having another person in the bedroom would be a fresh take on things. Typing this out it sounds like the classic she's-been-cheating-all-along, but I truly believe it's more of a discovery process.

&#x200B;

I told her I would definitely be willing to bring another girl into the bedroom and we agreed that the person would have to be right and someone we were both attracted to. Around New Years we were at our favorite bar for a party and I suggested we take a friend of ours home (not one from the couple). My girlfriend was hesitant, and I did not push, so that night we just went home and passed out together.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last night, my girlfriend made plans to go out to an event with a group of our friends, but I decided to stay home and try to take care of some backlog projects I've had going on. She had been messaging me all night, and finally around 1-2am she said she was coming home and would see me soon. It got to around 4am and I decided to log into her Apple account to use Find My iPhone just to make sure she was somewhere safe. This is nothing uncommon, yet not a frequent occurrence. (inb4 comments about being overcontrolling and other accusations). I figured she had been drinking quite a bit and decided to stay at the couples' place.

&#x200B;

I've had a bit of insomnia lately due to stress from work and side work, so I finally climbed into bed around 5am. Then I heard the garage door open and she came up to the bedroom. She said we should talk about something important. She then said that she slept with the wife. For the first 15 seconds I was happy for her, but quickly realized there was more on the horizon. She then explained that the husband was involved, but was more focused on the wife. Though she did let it slip out there was penetration (not that it matters that much in my mind at this point).

&#x200B;

My girlfriend has endometriosis which makes vaginal sex extremely painful. After talking for a while, our recent struggles with my work stress coupled with her worsening condition made it obvious that our sex life hasn't been great. That's when she let it slip that while the wife was a good experience, she still hurt (which only happens with penetration).

&#x200B;

That's when it finally hit my that I had been cheated on. I explained to her that it's one thing if we're both on board for bringing another person into the bedroom, but to not even be consulted on potentially sleeping with another woman, let alone a couple, is beyond the limits. I love this woman, but between this and our diminishing sex life with a dash of pettiness that comes to mind, I realize this relationship is over. This is my first real relationship, and first sexual relationship. Right now I am just afraid of having to start over. I've been taken advantage emotionally in romances before, and this has done nothing but drum these bad memories up.",relationship_advice

AITA for not trading seats on a plane?,"This happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought I was a bit rude, but I thought I was completely justified.


So we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. I figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so I booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


When we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he's very proud of it. Then he asked if I could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. I was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. I honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. So we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" I answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


As I said my girlfriend said I was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

Well, it's been about three weeks since my post and my breakup. And it took almost that full time to let it sink in what I've really done. I self wallowed for some time and attempted to guilt trip her and get my siblings to talk to her for me. What a mistake that was. She called and ripped me a new one worse than you guys did. She told me that she was thrilled we're not together and that I'm manipulative and ""disgusting."" That left me really shocked and I had to review my behavior over the time we had been together. I think over my life I always had an idea that with enough perseverance anyone's mind can be changed. I don't know where I got this from. I guess I thought it was a sign of being a strong person. Like taking what you want from life even when the chances are slim. It sounds stupid because it is. I reread my post just now and cringed the whole way through. Even the language I used showed that she was right and I am manipulative. She's a human being and I didn't treat her with respect. I played with our relationship to get her to change her mind about something very important to her. I deserve what happened. I also have realized that our views on the relationship were a little different. She had never brought up marriage or anything while it had crossed my mind almost daily because I really was so enamored. So I probably looked insane going on about having three children. It sounds so stupid to me now. Among the things she said on the phone, one was that she found my lack of respect for her body and choices appalling. I wasn't asking her to be forgiven, but I wanted to express how much her and her son meant to me. And as most dumped people tend to do, I couldn't even give a shit about what I was bitching about in the first place. I miss going to the park with her and her son. Those days were nice and calm and I didn't appreciate them. I let some fictional children and my bad habits ruin something good. I have a lot of self reflecting to do, and while I'm still sad, I know now that her dumping me was really for the best. Thanks guys for being honest.

It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word.

Since that time I got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until I landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. She calls at least once per day. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away.

My(24F) coworker(50F) blamed me for my miscarriage (UPDATE),"It's been a long day. First, I want to again thank everyone for their love, support, and advice. I wasn't able to answer everyone but know I tried to read all of them. Thank you.


So, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. Now, yesterday I was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. She did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


Co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. She saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming I wasn't working. What she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'I still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him I wasn't on the application and I wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


My boss calmly assured her that I was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (I get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong I guess, doubled down and was upset I hadn't communicated that to her. I didn't even know. My boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and I guess they talked in circles for a bit. He let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. She had nothing. 


When I spoke to my boss, at this point I was upset. I finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. He was not pleased. He did let me know I don't have to explain myself and that next time if I'm in that situation to go straight to him. He offered his condolences for my loss.


As for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. Anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. Though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. She has a laundry list of people to ask before me. He told me to document everything. Anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


Today, she hasn't been around me. She even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. She hasn't said a word all day. It's been a wave of relief for me.


TLDR: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. She is now not allowed to speak to me.

TIFU by misunderstanding a job proposal and quitting my current job as a permanent employee,"So, this actually happened two days ago, and it's still developing. I am working at a company where I feel completely miserable, and that pays barely enough to pay rent and survive, and been here for three long years. Anxiety attacks, depression, and the complete lack of hope into having a life where I don't have to struggle and skip meals to be able to pay my bills started to accumulate and boosted me to start sending cv's everywhere. The thing was that no one was calling even after months and months of applications. The paranoia starts and I slowly start to convince myself that my portfolio sucks, that I'm horrible at what I do, that I'll be stuck in this job forever, etc. etc. A few months go by, and a friend of a friend knew what I did, and asked if I was interested in an interview at her company because they had a job position opening up. I say yes of course, send my cv and portfolio, they answer back saying they loved my work and want to meet me personally for an interview. The interview itself went perfectly. I never felt so comfortable talking to someone in english (not my native language, and neither the native language of the guy that interviews me), and in the end, the guy basically says, and I quote word by word, ""For me, it's a yes, now it's up to you if you want to accept this position"". Of course I said yes, the job seems amazing, the pay is more than double of what I am currently making, it was way closer to home, everything is perfect. Before saying goodbye I asked him to send me by email the formal proposal just to be sure, he says, sure, I'll send it to you today or tomorrow, and I go back to work. The next day, and heres the fuck up, I give the notice to my boss before receiving the proposal in fear of not be able to start when need, telling that I got an awesome job proposal, but that I need to start in less than a week and half. Everything is being arranged where I work as I write this, I've handed my resignation letter, talked to the company owner and everything. What I did not consider, is that I had to give at least 60 days of notice since I am a permanent employee, and while I'm writing this, the HR department is to call me and tell how they will settle this up, in other words, how much money am I going to have to pay or ""not make"". The rest of the day of the interview goes by, and nothing on the proposal. The next day I email them, sending all my informations, and asking for the proposal, and they say that the dude that interviewed me is going to contact me. So today he messages me: ""Hey man, \*\*\*\*\*\* told me that you are available at the combined date, but remember, we are still to make a decision, did you tell your office that you are leaving?"" And I say that yes, of course, I legally had to, especially to start the day that you mentioned. And he just responds with an ""Oh.""

I don't know if I misunderstood something he said, or if he forgot to say something to me, but he always seemed assertive that I was going to be hired, since they weren't really interviewing anyone. Also, take in consideration that the interview was really informal. I asked if they when where they going to make the decision, and he said today, so I guess I'll update in a few hours if I'm unemployed and potently homeless, or if I got my dream job.

TLDR: Got ahead of my self, quit before getting an official job proposal; might be unemployed and homeless if everything goes bad.

TIFU by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell,"My wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. Sometime over the weekend I noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. I asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the Paw Patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. It came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. I loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

Fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school Alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. So my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. I pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. My son looks happy so I figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

Our conversation:

Teacher: Ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

Me: Yea! It's cool right? We've been playing with that thing for days. 

Teacher: Uh, Mr. Scott, do you know what that is?

I start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

Teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

I get confused. 

Teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

I'm still confused...

Teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

Me: It just...stays in there? 

She nods. 

Me: are you sure? I don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

Teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

We're both clearly uncomfortable. 

Me: alright then.....so where do I get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


My wife laughed hysterically when we told her. My son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

TL:DR thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and I played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

We are TTC currently and, just as it was with our son, I know when she's ovulating, I track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. I grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices I was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. I was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like I said, this device helped save a Chickoletta over the weekend. I've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. My wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

I'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",tifu

I (19f) dumped and blocked my boyfriend (19m) for his comments about my neighbourhood.,"I don't want anyone having the slightest clue about where I'm from, so I'll be kinda vague.

&#x200B;

I live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. It wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. It's home. Now that I'm at a huge university in my city, I've met people from all types of backgrounds. Of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. He's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. But I was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. We really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

&#x200B;

In my neighbourhood there is a small *""establishment""* that offers free *""services""/""products""* to kids who get good report cards/GPA. That applies from elementary school and until the end of College. College kids who provide ID also get a crazy discount. Finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. The good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.

It's like, in my HOOD hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. I think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. It's super lowkey.

I took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. He never seemed scared or judgemental. When we walked in, I was getting out my school ID. I explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. He laughed. I asked him what was so funny.

He said ""They shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". I asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

He says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. That getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. I told him that IS where I live. It's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

This started a huge argument.

I asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. I have 3. They were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. It's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. My mom goes to a new funeral every week. Some of the kids I grew UP with are in jail right now. My mom STILL hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. He said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. That there's ""nothing impressive about NOT being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". And that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass *'establishment'* '"". That this is why people get dependant on welfare.

At this point I told him I was done. I didn't want to debate, I didn't want to talk him. Not then, not ever again. We just went out separate ways. I broke up with him as soon as I got home.

He thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. That we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. I told him, yes the fuck we are. He's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  I think I may have overreacted with the block, but I want him to leave me alone. I don't want to work it out.

All my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood..

I'm not saying I HAVE to be with someone who's from my hood. But I have to be with someone who at least gets it. Especially when ""it"" has shaped who I am today. Idk what kind of person I am, but I think I might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it. That ""establishment"" means a lot to me.

Edit: I'm sorry I wasn't clear. Should I let him reach out to me? I don't want to get back together, but should I unblock him and talk it out. I'm worried that I'll fold and we might get back together. I've seen my friends do it all the time, they always go back. I'm worried conversation will make that happen to me. **I didn't suddenly stop loving him** and he still means a lot to me. But our core values don't align. What he said and did disgusted me. In the very place that means so much to me, he shit all over it.

Edit: Guys I did not make it out the hood at 19, I still live there lmao. I'm still a fulltime student at a big university in my city, working my ass off so one day I can get my whole family out.

TIFU by starting a petition to make my hometown environmentally friendly. I'm now receiving death threats. [UPDATE],"UPDATE: CBC News has emailed me asking for an interview today

Yesterday morning I saw this post on the front page:

>TIL: Relative to their size, leaf-blowers are among the most polluting machines ever invented. 1/3 of their fuel is released into the air unburned, as an aerosol; and the amount of pollutants released from running one for 30 minutes is equivalent to that of an F-150 driving from Texas to Alaska.

This led me to look into regulations surrounding fuel-powered leaf blowers in my current city (Vancouver) and it appears they have banned them in 2004. Cool! I then decided to check out my hometown (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) and realized that the city workers are using these things essentially on a daily basis.

Not good.

I decided to start my first petition and put it up on Facebook. I added it to one of the 'Buy and Sell' groups for Saskatoon, and little did I know I was about to be destroyed.

Immediately comments began to flood my inbox, and the amount of hate I was receiving was ASTONISHING! I also began to get messages suggesting I kill myself. Racist comments were many, and the petition had only reached about 10 signatures. People were sending me videos of them using their leaf blowers on absolutely nothing just to rub it in my face, and mentioning things like their ""1 ton diesel' trucks and even calling me ""diaper head"". Someone also suggested I inhale the exhaust fumes :/

Damn, I didn't realize that trying to help make for a cleaner city would elicit such a response. All I was suggesting was to switch to electric blowers. I'm probably going to just step back from this one. I've turned off comments as it's already over 100+ and incoming, and literally all of them are hateful.

Some of the comments:

TL;DR: Tried to petition for a ban on fuel-consuming leaf blowers (switch to electric) and received death threats and racism as a result. Probably going to abandon the petition disable my Facebook for a while 'til this blows (yeah, yeah) over.

"AITA for leaving my pregnant gf after a fake ""miscarriage""?","Basically my parents, her parents, and nearly all my friends are calling me the asshole for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend (it's my kid) so Just looking for perspective here. I'll keep things as objective as possible and happily accept my final judgement.

&#x200B;

3 months ago we found out that my gf (or ex now) is pregnant. It was a big surprise since we take precautions (condoms, BC) but she said it might've been a broken condom + she was bad about staying on BC routinely. Regardless, it was confirmed she's pregnant. I'm 21 and she's 20.

&#x200B;

I took the news badly at first. I became surly, didn't talk, and just kept to myself for 2 whole days right after she told me. I was terrified and did NOT want to be a father at all. I just needed time to adjust to the news. I think she expected happiness from both of us as she imagined I'd scoop her up and kiss her and cry tears of happiness after hearing she's pregnant (I know this bc she even referenced that scene in The Office where pam/jim find out they're having a baby).

&#x200B;

Our relationship during this time was extremely rocky because she wanted us to be engaged before the baby came, and I dragged my feet. I took her to all of her appointments, paid for as much as I could afford, and was there 24/7 for anything she needed. I guess it was more emotional connection that I just couldn't force through and she could tell.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago she sits me down and tells me she lost the baby. She says she had stomach cramps and then she miscarried. I was asking her a lot of health questions (I didn't know if a miscarriage this late into a pregnancy was normal?) and she kinda waves me off and is like don't worry I'm ok. After this our relationship's getting slightly better only because I'm slightly more relaxed now. She could tell and asks me to be honest about how I feel about the miscarriage. I tell her I'm sad it's happened so suddenly and mostly still worried for her but deep down I am really relieved because I 100% wasn't ready to be a father.

&#x200B;

WRONG answer. She starts screaming, crying, throwing things at me. She says she's not miscarried, that it was a test to see my dedication and I've failed it completely. In short we fought for like 3 whole days after this, with little sleep bc she'd randomly throw cups of icy water on me if I dozed off. At the end of that I said I can't do this anymore and broke up with her. I told her I'll be there for the baby and I'll pay my share of whatever is needed but I can't be her boyfriend and I can't marry her.

&#x200B;

\-----

Now friends and family are all telling ME that I overreacted, that its just pregnancy hormones and could I blame her? Everyone's saying things like ""you can't leave a 20 year old girl to be a single mother"" but I know that if I married her it could be the worst mistake of my life. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/birzcc/update_aita_for_dismantling_the_bed_and_taking_it/

This happened over the past few hours. So my wife and I started bickering because I forgot to buy her favorite kind of ice cream both times I went grocery shopping this month. I told her I'd go out and get some but she started yelling at me. She works a really stressful job so I just figured it was that.

She didn't want me to go and make a trip to the store just for the ice cream where our local food store is about an hour and a half away (living in a rural place sucks). I insisted, she said no, I said I wouldn't worry about it then. She got mad and said she would go get it and that I could sleep on the couch. I told her ""I'll be godamned, I bought the bed and if you have a problem, you can sleep on the couch"". She countered with the fact that her name is on the lease so it's her roof and I wouldn't be sleeping on the bed under her roof.

by this point it's escalated pretty bad just because of a childish quarrel. But I decided to take it a bit further. While she was gone, I took apart the entire bed and drove it to my friends house.

I'm currently laying in it and I'm about to turn my phone off to avoid the oncoming storm.

Teachers are not martyrs. They are working professionals trying to make a living just like the rest of us and the self-righteous attitude many of them have is honestly so annoying.,"Teachers like to complain about how they aren't paid enough and act like they're God's gift to society. Now I'm not denying their importance but the thing is, all professions are important. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, cleaners and garbage collectors all have important roles to play in society, and their pay is determined by the market and they only work 9 months of the year. 

Also the thing is, many teachers suck. They literally just read off slideshows and textbooks, in my opinion only maths and science teachers really deserve credit. 

When I was in grade 5 my one teacher left halfway through the year and came back the next year (presumably with full pay) because she couldn't handle how naughty the kids were. Like woman, that's your job. Also, when I was in grade 10 my accounting teacher had a breakdown because one of the kids told her she was a shitty teacher (and truth be told, he wasn't wrong). She went crazy at him, kicked him out of the class and didn't come to work for 2 weeks after that. Like, wtf. I worked as a waiter for several years during college and if a customer complained about me, I'd have to just suck it up and carry on, I couldn't lose my cool at the customer and God forbid I'd go AWOL for 2 weeks.

UPDATE: AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?,"Link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aja1al/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_girlfriend_because/

So the general consensus was that I was being a raging asshole, though a few thought I was just ignorant. It's been a while since I made that post, and my own conclusion is that I am probably both.

I've done a LOT of thinking about my behavior that week and I've realized a lot of things. This isn't something that I wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like I was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and I had been in a terrible mood. I wasn't acting like myself at all. Instead of coping in a healthy way, I'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).

The date wasn't really for her, it was for ME, and that's what I'd been trying to avoid thinking about. I was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that I was just upset because this problem had happened before. The truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. I was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.

That was extremely immature of me, to say the least.

I apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. Because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem I asked her if she had PCOS or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.

We went to have her examined and it turns out that she has PCOS, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. So yeah, I felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. Luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. She'll be getting regular treatment from now on so I'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.

Acne can actually make a person more attractive.,"I have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. However, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. Have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? I'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. To clarify, I am not talking about severe cystic acne. Painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. But people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. This kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. I can't really put my finger on it. It would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. And even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

Edit: 

Well this has never happened before. It's been kind of hilarious to read these comments going from: ""you're an absolutely disgusting vile human being"" to ""I 100% AGREE WITH YOU"". I'm also surprised at how unpopular this opinion really is! But I guess I put it in the right place lol. I'm not sure people should be thanking me either. I can be quite shallow as well. This is just one those subjective quirks I really enjoy and thought needed to be pointed out. But really if you read the comments some of the things YOU guys are into is pretty unconventional. Beyond all these superficial traits though, I think the biggest thing to remember is that sometimes love just happens to you. You don't get to choose it. So stop worrying about who you're gonna pick.

I am on mobile but I think I got the title as close to the original as I remember. 

Sorry for the delay. It got chaotic. 

He is currently in the hospital to help stabilize his seizures and have him evaluated for other services. He is sleeping and a bit dehydrated so he is being treated for that. He seems confused. He just wants to go home to his toys. He has a collection of Pokémon figures and plushies my dad has been buying him for years. It was their thing. He loves them and takes at least one everywhere. 

It was scary when I saw him. I don't think I have ever seen him this bad since we were kids. I remember the hospital when we were little but seeing it as an adult and knowing what is going on and how it is your fault is just something else. I feel just as helpless now as I did back then only now I don't have my parents to tell me it is going to be okay. 

I called the numbers/ organizations suggested but struggled to get a hold of anyone. APS seemed to take it seriously enough but when I talked to someone they said they would get back to me Monday when I mentioned he was currently in jail. 

I ended up calling the nurse on call from his neurologist office just to see if she had any suggestions. I was told I needed to call her if he had seizures that required the diastat and I was to call each time. I figured she would want to know since I had no way of knowing how long the seizures were or if they had given him any treatment. Well I called the answering service who called the nurse who then called me back but you get the point. 

She told me she would call me back and called the doctor on call. She called back and asked for more info and the jail he was at. It took a few hours but I eventually got a call back from the nurse saying the doctor had been able to get a hold of a medical professional for the jail and long story short my brother was eventually transferred to the hospital we are at now. The nurse said she and the doctor raised hell until someone heard them out. 

I talked to a lawyer this morning who came by the hospital to visit with me and my brother. I am going to sell my truck to my uncle to cover it. I am waiting on the check now. 
He seems like a great lawyer though. He told me it would be fine. I know he met with some of the doctors earlier about my brothers intellectual capabilities. I turned over all the paperwork I had and he told me they would call when they knew something further. 

They (doctors and his state case manager)  said he will likely be transferred to a temporary nursing home when he gets discharged here if he isn't required to return back to jail. They said there he can rest and get back on his medicines. After that, we will wait for the group home to respond to his application. The case manager said it is likely  that regardless of the legal issues I would be asked to compile with their effort to find him a suitable care setting. She mentioned not thinking  he was suitable with home care and community placement with me at the moment. I agree. I just want him to be okay. I know my parents were able to care for him but I just don't know how and I can't learn at his expense. 

Now I am just tired. He is safe at the hospital and I don't think he is getting released today.
So I am going home to sleep. 

I have kept the numbers of the agencies advised in the comments in case I need to reach out to them but I am going to just let the lawyer see what he can do. 

So thankful for the nurse. I absolutely believe she was instrumental in getting him help. She could have easily just told me to wait until Monday like everyone else I spoke with.

ID is intellectual disability. 

I am his guardian but he does have the GAL paperwork. It was in the stack I took to the jail. It was everything my parents had told me he would ever need in the event something happened to them. 

He hadn't been given bail yet. He was combative when he entered the jail and they said they were holding him and couldn't release him to me. When I asked about bail they said bail hadn't been set yet. I have never been in jail before so I had no idea. 

Everyone keeps asking for the county but I don't want to give it out since you could find out information on who my brother is from that. Southernish Alabama though. 

The jail guard who I think ran the front desk/phone. I am not sure what he did. But he was a big help. I am sure there wasn't much else he could do. I am forever thankful for him keeping me posted and caring what happened. 

I might not answer for a few hours. Thank you for all your advice. Especially the links to support groups/organizations. I will reach out when things settle for some advice. It really helped and it gave me places to start. Obviously this isn't over yet but it is a start. This is better than yesterday and that is something. Thank you.",legaladvice

There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun...,"The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


Curious, Attila did as he asked.


Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.


""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

Neighbor threatening to sue us for cutting down our own tree.,"Ohio

This January we had a giant oak tree cut down in our backyard. Prior to this happening we informed our neighbors as we had to have lots of trucks and a crane blocking the street and my driveway for short periods of time during the day they cut it down. No one said anything or seemed to really care. 

The tree was a huge hazard. All winter we had been experiencing small limbs falling and we were starting to get concerned for one falling onto our house. We did have the tree trimmed every other year. But one big limbs finally fell on our patio after an ice storm, crushing our furniture and patio awning. As soon as the weather allowed - we had the entire tree cut down. We discovered that the tree was actually very unhealthy. Most of the inside was decayed and there was a giant crack down the center of the base. Seriously a ticking time bomb. This definitely saved our house as well as our neighbors homes. 

Fast forward to the summertime, as our yards are coming into bloom and the heat is rising our AC bills. We did notice our electric bill was a little higher as we no longer have the usual shade of the tree. A small price to pay for our safety. 

Our next door neighbors have essentially a botanical garden in their backyard. They are retired and spend a lot of time working on their yard and landscaping. The tree branches had previously reached over a bit of their property, but more significantly provided a lot of shade over the house and yard. 

Apparently - now that their yard has gone from partial sun to full sun, a large amount of their flowers and shrubs were unable to thrive as usual. Their electric bill is also effected. 

Mr approached us a few times over the summer to tell us how selfish and rude we were to not consider how this would effect their yard now that there is significantly more sun. Their house is also featured on our townships garden club annual tour and they decided they could not participate this year due to the ""significant losses.""

Another neighbor (a much more reasonable one) said that he had approached them and asked if they would be interested in ""teaming up"" to sue for costs of lost landscaping and electric bills due to us cutting down the tree. He said no and then told us - just in case they decide to actually sue us. 

I realize this sounds completely insane. I can guarantee that the entire base and roots of the tree were on our property (no question - it was smack in the center of our yard). All that touched their property was the afternoon shade the tree provided and a few feet of branches.

We did inform them of this happening right at the beginning - I don't believe this is our fault that we prefer to spare our house and lives over their landscaping. In fact we probably spared their own home by cutting this tree down - if it fell in their direction it would have definitely hit their house too. 

Is there any possible leg for them to stand on?

EDIT:
Wow this blew up way more than anticipated! To answer the most asked questions - the tree removal company did acquire the township permits prior to removing the tree. We do not have to replace the tree - there are several other trees further back on our property.

We aren't really friendly with these neighbors - they are always looking to complain about everyone. A dog barks too loud, not cutting the grass often enough, another neighbor had their driveway re-paved that was not to their liking, once we had a party with about a dozen people and they called the cops because we parked on the street in front of their house (100% legal street parking). Everything anyone does makes their life more unpleasant. 

We will just continue our lives and if we are served we will respond. I did call the tree company just to confirm any documentation they have for cutting down the tree and they still have it and said they were more than willing to assist us if there was a problem.

AITA for not giving some of my deceased husbands things to his son?,"Throwaway for reasons.

8 months ago my husband passed away. He had an adult son from a previous marriage and the two of them weren't very close. I don't think they hated each other or anything like that. Honestly, I think the divorce had more to do with it. Because of reasons I won't go into here, his ex-wife basically had sole custody of their son and the two of them never had a chance to fix that relationship. 

Anyway, my husband held some animosity about the whole affair because he felt like his son sided against him in the divorce. Right before he passed he made me promise not to give his relatives any of his possessions (he had a bad relationship with his family and he owned some family heirlooms) and I asked him ""what about \[son's name\]"" and he paused and he said ""he doesn't get anything either"". Honestly, I was shocked, but I was pretty much grieving at this point so I didn't question it. 

Well, about a month ago his son reached out to me over email asking if he could have a couple of his father's items. He said he's been regretting that they never repaired their relationship and that he never got to say a proper goodbye. The items he asked about were small things like a gold lighter he remembers (I still have it) and a blue button up shirt (I don't know which one specifically, but I still have all of his old clothes). I responded and told him that unfortunately it would go against his father's wishes to give him anything and he replied very politely ""I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for responding."" and that was it. 

About a week later his mother sends me an email calling me names and a bitch for not giving her son the things he asked for and that I'm basically preventing him from moving on. I didn't respond and I blocked her email and I haven't heard anything since. 

I've been feeling sick ever since this happened. I'm still trying to move on from his passing and I'm not trying to stop him from moving on, I'm just trying to honor my deceased husbands wishes, but I feel like I've done the wrong thing and I don't know how to handle this.

"(WA) Neighbor who took cringe pictures with my car ia threatening me for ""ruining his reputation""","Y'all, the saga continues. I'm on mobile and don't know how to link my previous post but here's a summary: an idiotic neighbor kept taking pictures of and with my vehicle in our underground garage and posted them on social media claiming the car is his. 

I thought this dumbass needs a dose of online shaming so here's what I did. His social media accounts have a pretty high followership (10-12k) and as others suggested, he is indeed some kind of ""guru"" scammers. I don't really wanna say what type of scammer for privacy reasons (not that he deserves any). Well, I only have Twitter so I took it there. During his last photoshoot with my car, I took a few photos for evidence. I chose one of those pictures, tagged him in the tweet and wrote: ""I see [his handle] loves my car. That's cool but would be nice if he didn't try to brag about a car he doesn't own. This is him during one of the photoshoots in our shared garage."" 

Of course, it didn't take long until 1) dude deleted ALL the pictures of my car and 2) contacted me to threaten a lawsuit for libel (?) if I don't apologize to HIM publicly for embarrassing him in front of his ""fans"" and delete said Tweet. My ass was laughing so hard. I didn't reply which seemed to only piss him off even more because he was sending me angry emojis and curse words. I should also that my tweet gained traction and has around 120 replies and 300 RTs (I'm getting famous too!). Mostly, people are bashing him and saying what a retard he is. Others started making fun of his other posts (eg ""I'm starting to doubt he actually ate at that restaurant. Probably just took a picture and left""). Moreover, this scammer apparently claimed on social media that he lives on a mansion on Lake Washington and some of the commenters put two and two together and realized that he is actually my neighbor and there is no mansion. 

This dude basically says that it is my fault that all these people are making fun of him and that I am destroying his business (?). I'm not particularly afraid of his lawsuit and my lease ends next month after which I will be moving out so I don't really care. My question is, did I do something legally wrong? Can that be considered libel?

A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

""Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again"" replies the Buddhist monk.

TIFU I said no to my Gf's proposal.,"WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ONE. SCROLL DOWN TO THE TL;DR IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FULL STORY. 

Yeah... I f***ed up today. See, I've been dating my GF (K) for 5 years. We are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. I've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. The reason I haven't is that about 2 years ago, I got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

It's been VERY rough on the two of us, but K has stuck with  me every step of the way. My disease, GPA, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. I'm starting drugs that haven't been FDA approved for my condition. All other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. This new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. I'm terrified to say the least. All of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

I want to be healthy and stable before I even think about marriage. I don't want to leave K as a widow with no support! K & I had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that I needed to go into remission first. We agreed to it, or so I thought. Flash foreword to a few hours ago and K is with MY FAMILY in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

I saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. I immediately started freaking out. First thought: I haven't even gone into remission yet and I have no clue if I'm going to get better. I cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. What if I die from all of this? Second thought: GODDAMN IT DAD! Why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

I guess I'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my Dad was a very involved parent when I was young. When I entered High-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. The expectations would get so high that I couldn't live up to them. Similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. Both my brothers and I find this to be a real problem, if my Dad is left unchecked. I would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. Back to the story!

Anyway, I'm freaking out. I just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. Sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" With my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, I ran out of the building... I made the love of my life cry as I selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. I've never felt so ashamed in my life... After calming down, I talked to my Mother, and drove back to talk to K.

In the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. Tears were shed and things were said. K told me I was being selfish. ""We've been dating for years, who cares if you die, I want to marry you!"" She also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. She understood why I would be paranoid about my dad though. K understands that my Dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

In the end, we reconciled. We made up, decided that I was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. We came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

Now I'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if I do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, I'll be with my best friend/lover. K is my world, and I'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

Thanks for listening.



TL;DR
I said no when my GF proposed bc I'm on chemo and don't know if I'm gonna go into remission or die. Decided I was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.

&#x200B;

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  Also sorry for the long post.

&#x200B;

My wife(W) and I started dating about 5 years ago and got married 2.5 years ago, and we've had 2 kids since getting married.  We've known each other for over 10 years however, and I always thought she was a trustworthy friend.  She expressed her feelings for me a year before we started dating, but we had both just gotten out of other relationships and needed time to heal.  She then studied abroad for half a year.  When she got back, we hit it off and started dating within a month.  When W and I became ""exclusive"", my best friend(F) ghosted us.  I couldn't figure out why, seeing as how the three of us were all good friends, and had hung out several times since W had gotten back.  I had even talked to F about W and I possibly dating multiple times, which never seemed to bother him, he even encouraged it.  F had a girlfriend of his own at the time anyways.

&#x200B;

About a month into dating, W tells me a story of something that happened between her and F.  4 months prior, F went to visit one of his friends who was studying in a neighboring country to W.  He also decided to stop and see W for a couple days to see the country she was in.  In W's words, they went to a bar one night and she had way too much to drink.  She woke up in her bed that night to F taking advantage of her.  She pushed him off but he kept on trying over and over.  I hear this and instantly I am livid with F.  He had already been avoiding me for the past month, so I just stopped any attempt at talking to him.  I figured F stopped talking to us/didn't try to explain himself because he was ashamed of what he did.  W said she was confused about the situation and didn't really get angry about it until she had returned from abroad and seen F in person.  I had no reason not to trust W at this time and she seemed very sincere and upset talking about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

That was 5 years ago.  Throughout the years when F comes up in conversation, W always talks about how gross what he did was.  Recently however, W and I have been going through a rough patch in our relationship.  We started to fight a lot, which exclusively is always started by W.  She would complain about things I did(or didn't do) around the house, which would lead to name calling, threats of divorce, and even accusations of lying and even cheating on her(which is not true).  Our sex life went from okay(I'm the HL in the relationship) to a dead bedroom.  She blamed it on hormones(pregnancy/postpartum) but it really was getting extreme.  These things made me suspicious of her.  I thought maybe she's feeling guilty about something.

&#x200B;

So I snooped.  I know its a kind of shitty thing to do, but things have gotten bad and I wanted to know if she was hiding something.  I went on her laptop when she wasn't home, and I found all her iphone backups.  Long story short, nothing incriminating came up since we've been together.  Just texts between girlfriends about kids and whatnot.  That's a relief.  But then I found the texts from before we were dating.  I know she had some experiences when studying abroad, she's told me everything(or so I thought) so I took a peek.  And there they were, the texts between W and F talking about hooking up when they were abroad.  W saying how great the sex was, how F should visit again so they could do it again, and how she felt bad because at the time he had a girlfriend.  Plenty of graphic details that all seem 100% consensual.

&#x200B;

This honestly crushed me, and not because they hooked up.  But because she's been lying to me for FIVE YEARS about this.  She convinced me that my best friend raped her.  I've even told my family about how much of a scumbag he is, and I erased him from my life entirely.  There were plenty of other lies about her past that I found throughout her phone that just twist the knife even further.  I feel like the last 5 years of my life has been shaped by this series of lies.  Had she told the truth from the start, I probably could have looked past it.  But here I am, just learning about these things now in an entirely more complicated situation.  I don't even know how to start a conversation about this with her.

My(23F) sister(25F) and friends(20s) talked about how I'm not good enough for my boyfriend(25M). They don't know I heard and I don't know what to do,"Firstly, my sister and this group of friends are what I would consider my closest friends. I love this girls to death. I literally tried to donate a kidney for one of them. I am 100% heart broken

My bf is an amazing guy, kind, funny, smart as hell and pretty much a model. He's just gorgeous. And asexual.

This isn't a problem to me and we worked it out. He's also very open to it and everyone knows(which I entirely support!).

We were supposed to hang out a week ago but after spending about half an hour his job called him and he had to leave. This didn't bother me a lot bc I had a killer headache and went home.

My sister and I share an ap. to save money and we have a year long lease so I guess I'm screwed.

Long story short, I closed my door, didn't light up and got a nap. Next thing I know I wake up to my sister voice. She and those friends were at our house(from what I heard they were going to a club and were drinking a bit/waiting for the others).


I didn't get up bc I was lazy and would have to put pants. Then they started talking about me. I'm not proud but I was curious.

They were talking aboyt how they couldn't believe I was dating my bf, how he was too good for me, how I was too ugly to get a guy like him. My sister then started telling how being asexual is obviously a excuse to not have sex with me.

I'm not pretty and while it does makes me insecure I know I have other good characteristics but it was very hard hearing that.

They also made fun of my learning disability(they calle the r-word, which I can't even fucking write it). That I wasn't even financially stable, made fun of my job. They said I had to beg to be fucked.

All of my friends laughed and all of them shit talked me. I was crying pretty hard at that point. They left and I didn't know what to do.

I went to bed and basically made myself scarce this week. I get up earlier, get home later or stay at my bf. I have answered their messages but was somewhat cold.

I know I have to talk with them, even if it's to just cut off contact but I can't open my mouth right now. I feel so ashamed and sad.

My bf is also worried but I can't get what they said from my head. I know it's not true and my bf *is* asexual but I feel like I'm not worth being with him.

My sister is my best friend. I fucking told her how I feel too ugly and stupid to be with him. I showed her our messages and we spoke about his asexuality. I love her so much it hurts. I can't stand looking at her knowing she was saying those on my back, and that none of my friends said anything.

I just don't know what to do. I could break my lease, I guess(even tho it would be very expensive) but I don't know how to say why I'm doing it or how I can face them. I don't know if I should tell my bf.

TL;DR: my sister and friends mocked me for not being good enough for my bf. They don't know I heard them and I don't know what to do

"My (23F) BF (25M) wants to go on an annual ""gaycation"" where he ""becomes gay for a week"" ? Is this normal?","Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 1 year, but recently he suggested something that astonished and confused me. 

He wants to go on a 1 week ""gaycation"" with his best friend later this year, and he wants to make an annual thing.  I had never heard of this but he tells me it is when straight guys go on a trip and become gay for the duration of that trip, and are straight again when they come back. 

He says that during this trip he and his friend would basically look for other guys to have sex with, but that it ""wouldn't count"" because it would not be emotional, just physical, and that ""what happens on a gaycation doesn't count in the real world anyways."" 

Naturally I asked my boyfriend if he was gay or maybe a bisexual, but he acted offended when I said this and said it was just an annual 1 week ""bit of fun"" and that there was nothing gay about it, especially since it was only for 1 week a year. 

I don't know how to feel about this and it has caused quite a bit of argument with us. He insists it is normal and a lot of straight guys do it. This is my first serious boyfriend and aside from this one new issue everything has been great. 

Is it normal for straight guys to pretend to be gay for a week, and am I overreacting? Should I try to make a compromise? I'm very confused by this. 

TL;DR - My BF wants to go on a 1 week gaycation and I'm not sure how to feel or what to do.",relationship_advice

AITA for pressing charges on my Daughter for Fraud?,"Me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though I consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. For some basic context, she took out a Parent Plus Loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. In her first semester of her Freshman Year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. We explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. After me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. We brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

Come us, a couple years down the road. We've gotten a letter from the Department of Education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. We reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. She filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct Social Security Numbers and all. We've spoken with the school and the DoE a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. We can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in Medical Debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a Felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. At this point, I'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. We don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. So, here's the important question, reddit: if I press charges here, AITA?

Edit: Since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. A Plus Loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. Because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the Repayment Process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


Edit 2: I promised myself I would never do anything stupid like this if I ever had a post blow up, but now I truly understand what RIP Inbox means. I really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; I know reddit is one of the few places I can make a post and expect to get a reply.

AITA For essentially breaking up with my ex-girlfriend because she didn't behave at a gathering?,"I couldn't think of a better, more neutral way of putting it, but that's essentially what happened..so yeah.

I dated her for about 3 months. She was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. I loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. 
This whole thing happened a month ago. I had a really, really big presentation and I got really tensed. I had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so I did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. 

Well, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. She burped loudly when I was talking to my co workers, and told about how I didn't even have sex because of the stress. She proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. They were obviously uncomfortable too. The presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then I just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.

First thing I did when we sat in the car was saying I was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. I refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. She said she wasn't going to go till we sorted out the issue, I just told her to get out.
 Then I gave her a text message saying I was sorry for being rude to her but we weren't compatible, and to just move on with her life.

Fast forward to today, I bumped into a friend of hers who said that I had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being 'silly' at a gathering, and that no one could believe I turned out to be such a jerk.

Now I am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if I had indeed been a jerk. An unbiased opinion would help.

TIFU by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them.,"My grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. They don't go out much from their house. So I help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to ATMs etc.  I'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

Few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. It usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. I also had somethings to attend to. So, when I was done, I realised that it was late. I came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that I'll return his pension the next day. 

The next few days were so hectic that I completely forgot about his pension. I usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which I keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. I use the latter one more. After 5 days, I was in need of some cash. So I opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

I was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. I was so ashamed that i ran to their house. I knew that they'd be angry so I bought some groceries as a compensation. As soon as My granddad opened the door,  I started apologizing. He kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as I was done. I handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

Well my guilt was gone and I was again my normal miserable self. I opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. My guilt came running back to me, I walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. I knew I was the cause of this. 

I asked them about it and they told me how they knew I was busy and thought that I'd turn up when I have the time. They didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. I had never been more ashamed in my life.  My one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

They already had a really hard life. They had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. First their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. And I guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. It's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. I guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

TL;DR: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. They didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

My grandma is not literate. She dropped out of school in early years and couldn't read or write much. So she can't access any services. She just does the household chores. 
That's why I've been helping them.

"Fiance wanted an open marriage, so I called off the wedding. People are asking questions. Should I let them know why?","&#x200B;

\-----

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

She asks me to go to therapy with her. She was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. That sounded a little weird to me, I thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

Also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. I have never met her therapist. So to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

The day comes, and I go there. But out of self preservation, I had my phone opened and recording any audio.

My fiance was already there. I had to wait 20 minutes before I was invited in. The therapist greets me and shakes my hand. We have small talk. She tells me I am not at all the way my fiance described me. I think she is trying to compliment me. Then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

That absolutely weirded me out. But I am a calm and collected individual, and I don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

So the therapist starts talking. Has a small speech I don't care to repeat. My fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

I smile, I am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind I am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. Modern woman and girl power and all that.

Nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

The other non-traditional type of marriage. I forgot it's 2018.

But she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

Because she would be too heart broken knowing that I find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

So I let them finish talking. They were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because I wasn't saying anything. This was definitely something they have rehearsed.

I then asked the therapist if she is licensed. This, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. She said yes. So I told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

I wished them good luck, and left the office.

Now, I want to report the therapist. I am not sure if I have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? I don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and I want her to pay for the misconduct. That ""session"" did not sit well with me.

To be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. Even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where I could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. That's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

It also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. Now that I have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

So I was a fool anyway.

I listened to the recording, and I still can't believe what was said there.

Anyway, I called off the wedding.

I am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because I am not seeking them. There are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. That might have given my ex the impression I will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. Having listened to the recording a few times, I am confident the therapist recognized I am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

Now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions I am not comfortable answering.

How do I navigate this sea?

I am sure my ex is doing damage control, but I have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, I will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

But my parents and family also want answers, and I am not sure what BS to tell them. I don't want them to think I am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

She is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""We can work on this"", ""I didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

Last cry of a dying siren. All her cries fall on deaf ears, and I am the owner of said ears.

We were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but I cancelled everything.

I basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

Her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. I had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

Regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once I figure out where to do it, and what to say.

This post is mostly a rant, but I would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. My Ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and I don't want to be a he said / she said. I do have the recording, and am wondering if I should send it to the interested parties.

My ex doesn't know I have the recording.",relationship_advice
M (20) my girlfriend is going blind,"I'm 20 years old. And I've been with my girlfriend with one year. She's extremely unique and amazing, I love her more than anything.

No one should feel bad for catching a ball at a baseball game and not giving it to a nearby child.,"I'm even okay with wrestling it away so long as no one is hurt. (**EDIT: this refers to a simultaneous possession/catch scenario where the kid and i both have our hands on the ball at the same time. I am NOT okay with an adult running over to a kid who already caught it and snatching it away. But if the kid competes with me to catch it, I'm winning that competition and not feeling the least bit bad about it.**)Imagine if you're a baseball fan who's been going to games their whole life and you don't get a chance to catch a ball until you're like 34 or something. You catch one and someone's little kid is nearby and they're either crying or giving you that Oliver Twist ""May I have some more?"" look.

If you want to give the kid the ball, great. If you don't and you keep it, also great. I mean, think of who has more invested, here. The adult likely bought their own ticket, has been a loyal fan of MLB for much longer, understands and appreciates the game at a higher level than the child, will probably take better care of the ball.

But of course the cameras will be on you and everyone will be ready to hate you if you don't give the kid the ball. As a person who wants kids, fuck dem kids. It'll be a good lesson in how unfair life is. So let's weigh pros and cons.

If you give the ball away, people will say you're a swell person online, but you'll be upset because you don't have the ball. 

If you keep the ball, people will shit on you online and likely in the stadium, but then they'll forget AND you still have the ball. Kid will forget by next week. 

The winning option is clear. I'm not even a huge baseball fan but if I should so happen to be at a Cardinal's game one day and I catch a ball, I am keeping it and ignoring every kid near me unless it's my own kid.

**EDIT2: since people keep asking why an adult would want to keep the ball, a Blues player gave me a hockey puck a little while back. It sits on my mantle and is a great conversation piece. The baseball would do the same thing. But also, if I wanted to give the ball to my dog as a toy, that's my prerogative. The happiness of my husky means more to me than the happiness of some random kid. I also have friends who are huge baseball fans with kids who play. One kid I know personally and play chess with is 14 and a very good player and dreams to make it to the MLB. I can also see myself giving it to him. The point is, though, that what i do with it could be anything I want. It's mine.**

Divorce on table because husband and I cant agree on baby's name,"Hello reddit. This title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23F) and my husband (24M). 
We've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. I got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. Ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. Its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. In the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. He really loved her and he never hid that from me but I thought it was over once she moved away. Now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and I can name the second child. When I asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. He doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
Is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name OUR child like that.

"[MA] Landlord wants to fine/evict me for having sex with my partner in my apartment. Cites ""illegal activity"". Does he technically have a case?","So, bit of a weird one, so please bear with me.

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.

The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.

Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.

I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

AITA for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?,"So I have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when I was 13. I never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

Growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. It's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

I worked with him on and off through college and I've gotten very good at it.

He asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after I graduated. But my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

I do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. He also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

To no one's surprise, my father said I needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

I refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. My father was upset but I guess he figured he couldn't stop me. We continued having weekly dinners.

For some reason, people are liking my company's work more. I have expanded my company more than my father ever has. I also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. I don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless I want to.

Last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. I admit I did feel bad so I offered him a full time job in my company and that I'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. But I told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

This made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. He said I betrayed him. Then I basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

I do feel kind of guilty I ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. But at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

Maybe I sound confident and calm now, but in reality, my aunt and grandmother have shocked and hurt me and my father soooo very much by their actions recently, and the thought of dealing with her makes me feel nauseous. Please feel free to ask for more info if this seems too vague. Thank you for any help.

Edit: I'm in the USA. This occurred in Florida, but I do not live in Florida.

EDIT 2 PLEASE READ: OK hold up. I'm so relieved. Really sorry for the false alarm, but I just got a message from my dad. He told me my aunt left a voicemail for him and said that a lawyer is contacting her about the unpaid condo fees. I have no idea why she just didn't say that in the email. After the accusations they've made towards me, I thought for sure she was going to give me trouble and had hired a lawyer. I don't know how she didn't realize that her email sounded so threatening",legaladvice

AITA for being honest with my nephew about where I was for most of his life?,"Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

A couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

I got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",AmItheAsshole

My car was stolen. Police found a 16 year old driving it but say they can't charge him because there is not enough evidence. Thief is the son of a city councillor [California],"My car was stolen out of my driveway. I came out in the morning to find my car gone and some broken glass in the driveway. I called the police and filed a report.

Last week the police called me and told me the car had been found and said that I could come and pick it up. I picked it up from the police station but the clutch and the transmission were fried (it's a manual) and I had to get it towed back to my house because I couldn't drive it. The police told me they caught someone driving it and they were working on the case.

Besides the window being broken and the clutch and transmission being fried the car reeked of marijuana and had empty beer bottles all over the floor. While I was cleaning it I found a cell phone under the seat. It was unlocked and it had notifications up. I brought the phone to the police figuring that it would help their case. This is where it gets weird.

The officer took the phone but told me there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone with anything so I should just cut my losses and move on. I didn't understand how this was possible because they told me they caught someone driving it and the report they sent to my insurance company confirms this.

I called the police again and kept getting the run around so finally I asked to speak to a supervising officer. The supervising officer told me they didn't have enough evidence on ""John Smith"" to charge him with anything. I don't think it's a coincidence that ""John Smith"" is the son of a city councillor. The supervising officer told me that the case was closed and I should leave this alone.

Is there anything I can do to get them to charge him? He was found driving my car that I have on video being stolen. His phone was found in my car, the window was busted, the transmission and clutch were fried, the car smells like marijuana and had 36 beer bottles on the floor. The bill to fix my car is going to be a fortune. I know that if he wasn't the son of a city councillor he would already be in jail. Also despite having a clean driving record and no criminal record I have been pulled over 4 times since I got my car back while driving my rental. All 4 times it was just so the police could ""check my documents"". A strange guy in a suit also came to my house and has sat in a car outside my work. He never says anything to me he just smilies and waves. The police say he isn't breaking any laws by being in public.

What can I do about this? Can I talk to the state police or the FBI if the local police won't help?

TIFU by trying to stand with no legs,"This happened about a week ago. 

So some context to this. I was born with no legs. I have never had them they didn't even develop past like 2 inches of a femur but you cant really tell. 

I came home from fishing with my in-laws and was dead tired. I went from door to shower to bed and had no intentions of waking up before 10 hours. My wife woke me up so that way I could eat dinner. So I get up and am totally groggy and not really capable of thinking right.

My wheelchair is right there next to the bed so I scooted to the edge and sat there for a moment. For whatever reason I thought it would be a good idea to try and stand... It was not until it was to late did I realize what I had done but it all became slow motion... the fall... and seeing the floor get ever close. Now I have a very good tolerance to pain. While staying active I have broken bones and cut myself up on rocks and such but nothing was able to prepare me for this... I landed flat on my balls...

I tried to scream but no sound could be heard however I am sure our neighbors dogs were losing their shit. I vomited and tried to move but couldnt even breath. My wife is having a hard time trying to show concern and hide her laugh at the same time. 

She has heard stories about how I have hurt myself in similar ways (waking up late for work with morning wood and nearly breaking my dick on a stair) but she never witnessed one.

The Doctor was stumped on how to react outside of ""heres some pain killers dont move for a while"" 

Also  I swear time become relative cause I am almost positive I watched 2 Alaskan sunsets but it was only for about a hour I was on the floor in a puddle of puke. 

TLDR: have no legs, tried to stand up off the edge of my bed and smashed my balls. 

EDIT: Oh wow lol. I am happy alot of people have enjoyed this post. To clear a few things up yes my wife did try and help me up but I told her to leave me because I was in to much pain to sit up. She did clean up a good deal of the vomit but much of it was under me and I was not moving lol. She sat next to me the whole time. 

EDIT2: Some people have asked why I tried to stand up. I think alot of it might be that everyone I have seen get out of a bed has done the same motions I attempted, so in my tired state for whatever reason my brain(that prick) decided this was the motion to use.

Also people are saying they want to say a joke but dont know if they should.. DO IT! While some people may see it as a sad thing that I have no legs they should not. It hasnt stopped me from doing fun things in life even mono skiing and going on mountain trails. If I couldnt see the humor in my own disability(and there is PLENTY) life would be very hard.

I just found some pornographic photos of me as a child at my fathers house. I don't know what to do. TEXAS,"I had to make a throwaway account to avoid being identified. 

I am at a loss for words right now. I feel like my entire existence has been a lie. I have lived for 28 years and now I feel like I even know who I am anymore. 

I was helping my dad and stepmom clean up for a garage sale. I was in the attack and was going through a bunch of old boxes that hadn't been touched in years. I was looking through one box and there were some photos of me with aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members on my dads side. I had never seen these pictures so I looked through them all. After a few photos, they were just photos of me. Usually alone on a bed. Then there were photos of me naked. And I was crying. I dont really want to go into detail of the rest of the photos I saw. 

My parents were divorced, so this must have happened during Christmas or summer break since that's when I had visits with my dad. My mom is going to be devastated. I don't want her to blame herself. She tried hard to allow my dad custody. He was physically abusive towards her, he was wealthy so I guess he had a good lawyer. 

I'm not really sure what my next steps are here. Do I report this? I never had any behaviors from this alleged abuse nor did I have any PTSD because I never knew I was abused. My mind is all over the place and I just feel lost.",legaladvice

WIBTA if I set my Mother in Law up to drop in on my roommate jerking off?,"So, the title is probably almost as weird as the actual explanation. Bear with me.

I've got the typical awful, overbearing MIL situation. The woman doesn't like me, hasnt for roughly 6 years now. Her son and I have been together almost 7 years. We have two kids. She's done everything from boundary stomping, criticizing our parenting choices, threatening to have our child taken from us and placed in her custody if we moved out of state, and threatening to call CPS if we didnt bow to her wishes. Suffice to say this woman is insane, and we DID end up moving 2000 miles away with zero chance of losing custody, obviously.

So, we are no contact with her off and on. Currently we hear from her once every 3 months or so and see her once a year. The most recent time she was in town, she gave my boyfriend an amazon alexa for the kids. It's one of the fancy ones with the screen and camera for video chatting. Now, maybe I'm just being petty because her and I obviously dont get on, but I'm not interested in seeing or hearing from her any more than we do already.

My boyfriends younger brother and his girlfriend, when they found out that she had gotten this for us, warned me to disable the drop in permissions because this woman was just randomly dropping into the device and accessing the camera into their apartment. So I was INSTANTLY suspicious of this fucking thing. I disabled the permissions, and the kids aren't allowed to use it unless someone is in the room anyway.

I was talking about how shady it was with our roommate, and he said that he had a MUCH better idea than disabling it.

Put it in his room, and any time he feels like it, he'll just jerk it while making direct eye contact with the camera.

I feel like disabling it is enough, but I would be lying if I said this wasn't a hilariously tantalizing prospect. Is it over the top to do this if I'm pretty confident that she WOULD just drop in and see this happening?

Thanks in advance!

My (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me,"I can't stop thinking of it. I've been in the bath for a long time because I've been dreading going to bed with him. 

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him ""Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that"". And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said ""if you love him so much, why don't you suck his dick instead of mine"". I couldn't say anything, I didn't know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

I don't even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don't have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being sensitive?

I (30m) and my wife(31f) decided to take custody of my half sister(10f) after my stepfather died in an accident. I suspect that she was abused.,"This is actually so heartbreaking to write. I really never knew my stepfather that much, because my mother married him after I moved out. My mother died fighting breast cancer and the custody of my half-sister was given to my stepdad. She was only 4 when my mom passed away.

I used too see her once in a while. She was always a quiet child. She didn't speak much to me. I always remember thinking something was wrong with my stepfather. He just didn't seem like a nornal person.

So, he died in an accident and I was asked if I was willing to adopt her. I and my wife have a 5yo daughter and we were trying to have another child when this happened and we felt that we could give her a better life. We were actually so happy. My daughter was very excited because she got an elder sister. She was very auiet and reserved but we thought that it was natural. 

But yesterday she came to me and she told me that she ate some chocolate from the fridge without asking us. I told her it was fine, and that this was her home and she could have whatever she wanted to.

But she suddenly started crying and told me that she deserved to be punished because she stole something. I was really taken aback by what I heard. My wife was alarmed and talked to her one on one and I was really shocked.

TIFU by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that I had to be rescued. Then I did something really embarrassing.,"


A few years ago I spent a Saturday blissfully tripping by myself. I had dosed that afternoon and I started coming down as the sun was coming up. It was a bright, crisp morning and I felt completely at peace. I was shuffling my music and Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground came on. It was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

I suddenly made a decision. I had to make some changes. I had to get my fat ass to the gym.

I was surprised to see so many people. I had thought, hey, 7am on a Sunday, I'll have the run of the place. I was obviously incorrect. All the cardio machines were taken. I couldn't just stand there. I was already getting sweaty and I'd been so high for so long so recently.

I saw an empty bench press and went for it. I couldn't remember what I used to bench back in school so I decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. I am 6'2 and 250 lbs. I was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

It was heavier than I imagined. I figured my guns were rusty. I decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. Suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. It was all I could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. I let it sit on my chest while I came up with a plan. Every time I tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. I decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. With momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. Perfect. I tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*Wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

The bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. I lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. Sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. If anyone heard it, they ignored it. Despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. It hurt. I slowed my breathing and just relaxed. It'll be ok, I thought. I got this, I prayed.

*Brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

Nope, it's bad, this is bad. Everyone had to have heard the rounds I let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. The volume was incredible. No one knew I was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. No one laughed. Time was frozen but I assume only a few minutes passed. Finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. He looked up at me with genuine concern.

""Hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............WHHHOooooooot.*

To his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. More like a twitch. I nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. I tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. He left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. Everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. All I wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. Like I wasn't bothered at all.

So, knowing I was being observed, I did this. I stood tall, nodded to myself like I nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *Alright*

**Fuck.**

**Me.**

The door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. I ran to my car.

I can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. There is nothing funny about The Clap. It pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. I just wanted to look like a normal human being.

TL;DR I went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak I am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until I was rescued. Then I pretended I had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *Alright* as if I could alter reality by sheer force of will.",tifu
"AITA for insisting my sister replace a playstation her kid broke, even though I was watching him?","My (25f) BF (25m) has a PS4 and a couple dozen games, he bought it new 3 months ago, but with no warranty so he's made a conscious effort to keep it in good condition, including packing it away in the box when he doesn't think he'll use it for a while. He did this yesterday, putting the console in the box and then putting the box into a larger plastic storage container with all his games, as he's out of town for next week. He left the container under our bed, but the side was poking out so you could see the playstation box through the plastic.

Today my sister (31f) had a few work meetings, one after the other, over about 5 hours, and rang me in a panic, saying the sitter called in sick and she needed someone to watch Nephew (11 years old). I reluctantly agreed, and she dropped him by. He wanted to watch TV so I gave him the remote and got on with my work. Couple hours go by without incident, but then Nephew got hungry. I went to the kitchen to cook for him. About a minute later I went to check on him and he was gone. I found him upstairs in mine and BF's room, digging through the container with the PS4 inside. By the time I'd gotten there he'd taken out the box and a few games and I asked him what he thought he was doing.

He said he was bored and wanted to play. I said no. He did the whole ""I'll tell my mum you're being mean to me"". I said ""tell her what you want, still not happening"". Nephew, on realising I wasn't about to let him use it, tried to run past me, carrying the PS4 in his arms, presumably to hook it up to the TV downstairs. IDK what happened exactly, if he tripped or lost his grip or what, but he dropped the PS4, right at the top of the stairs. It fell down the flight of stairs, and when we checked it it's a mess of cracked plastic and wiring.

I clean up, give Nephew his lunch, sit him in front of the TV. The whole time Nephew is saying that I should have just let him use it. I rang BF to let him know and he's obviously mad/sad but says that it's fine when it clearly isn't. He asks me to look up prices for a new one and it's more than we can afford rn.

Sister arrives, asks if Nephew was any trouble, and I tell her about the console. She immediately says I should have watched him better. I tell her that I was cooking and that I watched him today for 6 hours, as well as countless other times I've babysat, and never once expected payment, but in this case it's ""you break it, you buy it"", and I show her the prices I got when I searched for a new console. She says I'm being unreasonable and she's not replacing it because she didn't do it and I was watching Nephew, plus she's not paying for a new one when BF had his for a couple months already.

AITA?

INFO: BF has previously told Nephew that he isn't allowed on it and due to lack of warranty BF treats the playstation like it's made of glass.

INFO: BF bought his console from a friend for £229 and it sounds like the friend had had it for a while and just never used it, which is why the warranty was expired. The replacement I found was used in ""fair condition"" for £129 but the page I showed my sister contained the £129 one and some significantly cheaper ones that would have been fine.

Also: When I said ""new one"" I meant one that isn't a heap of wires and plastic, not a brand new pristine condition PS4.

Update: BF complained to his brother, who offered him a free xbox and some games. IDK what type but it's whichever one was before the latest one as the brother upgraded to the latest console.

Update 2: BF is saving up for a new ps4. His birthday is in September and his grandparents still send him a card with £50 in it which is already nearly half and he can budget for the rest. He says that this is probably a good thing (losing the playstation and me arguing with my sister) because now we have a reason to never babysit again.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by getting too adventurous with my toe,"This wasn't today but a few weeks ago. It feels like it was 5 minutes ago though with how cringe I feel when I think about it. Also, if you didn't gather by my username, I am a guy. 

So we went to see The Book of Mormon in a theater that is very, very old. Not new to seeing stage productions and given that this particular theater was over 128 years old, I knew it was gonna get warm af in there. 

I know you should dress up for theater shows, but I don't really get that as you sit in the dark 90% of the time. I wore a decent button down, short sleeve shirt and some nice jeans. However, I also wore flip-flops knowing it was gonna get extremely sweaty. 

Sure enough, it was hot and humid as fuck within the first 15 minutes of the show. I slipped off my flip-flops and mostly enjoyed the show barefoot while letting all the heat escape from my feet. This was fine for awhile.

Then the major fuck up.

At one point, ansty as ever in a cramped seat, I edged my toes over the edge of my line of seats so I was technically in the space of the person in front of me. 

My right big toe touched the seat in front of me. Wow. This is softer, plushier, and all around better than what I assumed an old ass theaters chairs would feel like. 

So yeah.. I had stuck my toe into a seat and then gave it a nice little wiggle cause I wanted to feel the chairs velvety softness some more. 

As you've figured out, it was not the chair, but it was the girl in front of my chair's ass that I just poked and wiggled with my toe. She jerked her head to the side super quick while I started dying inside. 

I immediately said sorry and kept my feet strictly *under* my own chair the rest of the night. I thought I was free and clear from the embarrassment (besides lady in front of me's knowledge of the events) until my husband asked me why I apologised randomly in the first act, so I had to explain. 

I am still dying over this. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR Thought I was feeling a seat that was cushy, but instead it was a ladie's tushy.",tifu

TIFU by falling deeply in love with my own smell.,"This didn't really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. This is a throwaway because I'm very embarrassed. Sorry about formatting, I'm typing this on mobile. My girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. It was a horrible event and I still haven't been able to get back into the game since. I was and still am very much in love with her. Now to the fuck up.

My favorite possession of all time is her pillow. It smells like her, and I usually sleep with it every night. I haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (I know, gross but I don't think straight anymore). I hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. But this morning when I went for a particularly long morning run I started smelling the smell. Really strong. It confused me but I wasn't going to start complaining.

This morning, about 20 minutes ago I arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. And the smell grew more pungent. This was the moment I realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, I got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. I'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell I thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

TL;DR- Slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.

TIFU by microwaving a chef boyardee on an active military base,"As with most things this happened last week. I'm currently deployed in the middle east. We got off work a little later than expected and missed the galley hours so we stopped at the mini mart on base to grab some food. They have a decent selection mostly just your typical gas station food. So some guys grab cold sandwiches or microwavable burritos, I decided to go for the chef boyardee classic spaghetti and meatballs. Now you have to heat you food at the mini mart because they don't trust us with microwaves in our rooms. You'll understand why soon enough. I put my spaghetti in the microwave and set the timer.  We are just bullshiting in the mini waiting for our food when all of a sudden a loud bang what sounded like a gunshot goes off behind us and without skipping a beat there were 4 marines M16s raised yelling at everybody to get down as they make their way through the shop clearing the isles straight towards us. That's when I realized I forgot to remove the metal top from the spaghetti. I had to show them the inside of the microwave now covered in spaghetti sauce and meatballs before they finally relaxed and put their guns down. I ended cleaning the microwave and buying a second chef boyardee.

UPDATED: Do I need to get a new ring before I propose again?,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chgt65/do_i_need_to_get_a_new_ring_before_i_propose_again/

Thanks to everyone who commented on the last post. Someone suggested I take the ring for a cleaning, and get an extra diamond or something added, instead of a new ring. I liked this suggestion and I was going to do it but I ended up taking a different route.

I ended up talking to my mom about it and what she thought. She said proposing with a new ring is a no-go because I already did that and she already has one. She said the ring should be the centrepiece. She also said I shouldn't propose empty handed because there needs to be a reminder of the day she said yes, instead of only a reminder of the rejected proposal.

So we ended up going shopping and I settled on a nice silver heart locket which she helped me pick out. It was very pretty and fairly inexpensive compared to the ring and I was really happy with it.

I sat on it for a while until the time felt right. We were watching TV on Sunday night and having some wine and everything was really chill and it just felt right. So when I went to top up our glasses I grabbed the locket and I proposed to her on the lounge sofa. She cried, and she said yes :) I cried too and it was really beautiful and special.

Just wanted to provide an update to let you guys know it all worked out :) thanks",relationship_advice
I [24m] was technically raped by a girl [23f] and now she's becoming friends with my friends.,"So a few months ago while out with friends I met and befriended a girl. She was cool, she just had what seemed to be an issue with taking 4loco and Xanax, but other then that she was pretty and seemed fun to talk with. She would come out with me and some friends once and everything seemed fine, but then we saw her pop some pills and drink and she would act c. kind of crazy, and kept showing me photos of herself naked asking for my opinion.  

 I just humored her and said she was pretty and made sure she didn't drink anymore after she had done what she did. Fast forward to later the night, she doesn't want to go home because of her family (I get it family can suck), so I offer to have her stay at my place since I've drank a bit too. So I get a Lyft and we head back to my home. So when we're back I open my couch up since it's a bed as well and get it ready, but she doesn't want to sleep there yet. So being the good guy I just tell her she can watch Netflix with me in my bed til she's tired. 

So as we're watching Netflix, she leans over to me and asks to have sex, but I decline, telling her she's still not sober and I don't want to have sex nor see do I see her in that way. I get it watching Netflix in a bed together can be misleading and I apologized for that. She says okay and that it's cool I don't like her like that, and while we're still in bed, I semi drunkenly doze off. I woke up a bit later, and I feel this sensation, and I open my eyes and I see her on me, riding me. 
      
She looks at me and realizes I'm awake and actually smiles. I feel repulsed, I'm still a bit drunk too, and I don't feel the strength to toss her off, so I pretend to go along with it, fake an orgasm, then I hope out of my bed and go sit on my couch in the living room. I was shaking, I felt gross, but I try to shake it off and just sleep on the couch. I woke up early in the morning, drained because I couldn't sleep, and kept panicking myself awake, and I go and wake her. 

She then asks for sex, and I'm repulsed but I think to myself, maybe if I take control I won't feel this way.  So I agree even though every fiber in my beings screaming no, and we start to have sex, I'm in full control, but I just can't finish, and I stop, and I call a Lyft for her and send her home. So a few months have gone by and I've still been trying to cope with it, I was shamed by men in my family I thought could help me, telling me men can't be raped, and that I'm being a bitch, and I still don't really know how to deal with it but I'm getting by. 

So tonight my friends invite me to their place to hang out, it's been a minute and I'm excited to see them too. When I show up and open the door to their place though (they left it open for me) I notice someone sitting on the couch in the living room with my friends. It's the girl. I felt betrayed, even though I never told my friends, and I felt repulsed. I went pale and my hands became clammy, and when my friend saw my face he came over and asked if I was okay,  I told him nothing and just left. So right now it's 3 something in the morning, I'm drained and don't know what to do. How do I tell my friends what happened? In my heart I know they wouldn't be like my family, but I trusted my family and they said I was overreacting and being a bitch when I thought they'd never say something like that. I'm afraid my friends will too.

I told my boyfriend (32m) that I (28f) was raped 10 years ago and he cant get over it.,"Okay, so, about 5 months ago my boyfriend and I were up late one weekend drinking and talking for hours (which we do often). Somehow, we came to a topic that led me to tell him that I had once been raped when I was 18. I had just turned 18 at the time and so this was something that happened over 10 years ago. It was terrible, the worst experience of ny life. I was just days past my 18th birthday when I was raped by 3 different men at a huge new year's eve party. I was young and didn't know what to do, so I just didn't tell anyone and dealt with the emotional aftermath on my own. 

I had never told anyone about this before but I felt comfortable enough to tell him about it. After it happened it took some time but I obviously healed from it, moved on and put it somewhere far back in my mind where I really didn't often visit it. I think I dealt with it in a reasonably healthy way considering and I'm okay today... mind you this is over 10 years later. 

Here's the problem... now he keeps bringing it up pretty much every two weeks, at least. He questions me for more details to the point I've told him every detail about it I can remember. This is not fun and really very uncomfortable for me. I discuss it with him because he tells me that it deeply bothers him and makes him angry at who did it to me and that there's nothing he can do... he has a list of reasons why it bothers him so much, including that it has caused him ro no longer see me as ""perfect"" in his eye, which he says I was before. 

When he gets upset about this he will distance himself and become really unpleasant and grumpy... and he honestly appears borderline depressed. I have talked with him about it a lot in the hopes he could move past it but it doesn't seem to be happening. I really don't know what to do at this point and I don't feel like it's fair to me to be put through reliving this every couple of weeks, or that I should have to feel bad about something that I was a victim of. He makes me feel like I'm tainted and less lovable or acceptable now. We have talked about breaking up if he can't move on. 

Are his feelings understandable? Should I continue to try to help him move past it? Or am I right to be upset? I honestly think it's ridiculous at this point. We are both adults and I certainly understand the world is not perfect, nor are people, bad things happen to good people every day and we learn from them, do something if we can, and keep moving in a forward direction. I also am aware how many other women have gone through terrible situations similar to mine. I'm tired of feeling like I'm on trial in my own relationship. I'm upset that he's making things about him, I feel like it's selfish. I went through it 10 years ago and I need to move the f... on. ",relationship_advice

"[Update] My neighbor falsely believes my disabled BIL was being creepy, and I want to protect him.","Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9hm58g/my_neighbor_falsely_believes_my_disabled_bil_was/

Hi, all. Sorry for never replying to everybody's really kind, helpful advice -- I'm bad at reddit and really busy right now. I really do appreciate it.

For a few days after my initial post, my husband or I would walk my BIL to his usual spot after work and watch from a distance to make sure he wasn't behaving inappropriately (he might have by accident). Neither of us saw him do anything out of the ordinary; he just sat on the bench, took pictures, and looked around at the trees and flowers. He didn't watch or interact with anybody else, which is about what we expected. He's so, so shy.

Per a lot of advice, I didn't delete any of my BIL's photos for awhile. This pretty quickly got to be unmanageable though, because he takes 50-100 pictures every day, often just the same thing again and again. But we set up a google drive to save them all. 

My husband and I also talked to BIL a LOT about what to do/say if he is approached by police. He is not very verbal and very quickly gets flustered and upset in unfamiliar social situations, so we really practiced pulling out his medical alert card and being very ""non-threatening"" with his body language (my BIL is 6'5"" but has physical mannerisms a little bit like a child's, so if you don't know him or why he's behaving the way he is, he can be pretty alarming). To be honest, I'm still nervous about it, but we practiced and talked about it a lot.

As for my neighbor, I saw her again a few times and she ignored me. I considered bringing my BIL to meet her properly, but decided I didn't want to expose him to her freaking out. About a week ago, she approached me and told me she appreciated my ""taking control of the situation,"" but that my BIL's disability was ""no excuse."" I said ""No excuse for what?"" and she said ""for filming and photographing children."" I considered pointing out that it isn't illegal to do that (as you guys did), but that would sound like he IS doing it, so I just told her that she isn't doing that. She threatened to call the cops again but so far nothing's come of it. I'm keeping an eye out. In any case, it's getting colder, and my BIL is spending less time just hanging out. He's also really happy to come with me to doctor's appointments, and I'm currently pregnant, so we've had a lot of those. (My neighbor started saying something about how I'd understand if I was a mother. I'm not showing yet, but I really considered telling her I was pregnant just to shut her up. But that's needlessly combative, lol.)

Thanks again to everyone's kind advice. Husband and I are currently working with BIL on responses he should give if that neighbor/anybody else approaches him while he's nature-photographing.

[Update] I'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.,"Hey folks.

In proper internetiquette, I'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. I received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. Your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. Even your scorn, some of you. I'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. But when I said before that I wanted to take all of it in, I meant it. I intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

To the meat and potatoes: **I got my money back.** It wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. It was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. I also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. I was surprised by the Bride, but I welcomed it. You should welcome all positivity. I said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. I feel like, thanks to you all, I explored every thread in the tapestry of how I should feel and what I could say. It brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. You saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. You saved me from rash actions and words I wouldn't have been able to take back.

I know some of you will wish I went off. But I want peace, and what's the metaphor? Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? I just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what I'm trying to say is, I know now that I was just as responsible for how terrible an experience I had. This isn't a self-blame thing, I'm not being low-self esteem. The fact of the matter is, I could have said no, and I could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way I was treated. From so many of you I've learned that this is called self-worth. Self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

Don't get me wrong. I still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. It's their wedding day. And this goes double for people you're very close to. But you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. And yeah, I accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. But from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, I should have reassessed the relationship. Measured my value without the context of Groom's friendship and focused on that.

I think part of the reason why I took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, I could stand tall as the good friend and person I know I am. Maybe some small part of me thought I could prove to the Bride that I was someone she should have always counted on. Show the Groom how a groomsmen should be. This was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. You should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. This can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. I know this now.

So what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? I think he made that clear. If I was so important to Groom, I'd have been by his side that day, but I'm not so important, and so I wasn't. This is fine. It was his decision, and I told him myself the day he told me I was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" It's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. Certainly not me. Not anymore. Ultimately, this means I maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. I have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. When you find the right people, there is no chase. And one day, I'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. I don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. We won't have hella cursive name cards.

I want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. I was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. I'm not going to be a doormat, but I'm also not going to be fucking heartless. If people need help and I can help, I will. I'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. I know that I'm a good friend, and a great person, and I'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

I know that I still have my problems and I'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, I want to encourage you: I used to be so self-conscious about myself, I'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because I didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. I used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping I'd go away. I used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. I'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that I still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

I mentioned I was always an overweight person, but I should also say that I've lost 122lbs to date and I'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). At my average weekly rate, I'll hit my goal in less than six months. If you're struggling similarly, I want you to know that you can do it (DM for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). Also, this was supposed to be a thing where I counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women I'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or I can't tell if they are (DM your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but I'm not so insecure about it anymore. I know that when women smile at me, it's because I made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. Finally, and this is key, I know who my friends are, and I know that I never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). I know that my real friends asked why I was working the wedding. They asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't I the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. They tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed I was down. They invited me in to pictures. They said they wished I'd had a better time. They commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. They told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how I go above and beyond for people. They told me that, at some point, I have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. Focus on these kinds of people in your life.

You'll have your lingering questions about this. I'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. If you have more questions, ask them and I'll answer. If you have more advice, I'm all ears.

I just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and I want to live up to that. The heaviness I felt was lifted, message by message, in your every positive thought and shared painful experience. You helped me feel not alone. I want this to be the standard for everyone moving forward. Please, treat each other like good friends. If you are ever down, if you ever want advice, if you need to hear an embarrassing life story to bring levity to your situation (my life story is filled with movie-level embarrassment) please DM this account. I'm here for you.

TIFU by sending my friend and his gf wine at a restaurant,"My friend is currently in another state right now with his girlfriend for their anniversary. We both visited this city last year and had a blast so he decided to take her for a nice trip. When we were down there we went to an amazing Tapas restaurant with fantastic food and wine. Yesterday he tells me they made a reservation for today and she's really excited to go!  
  
So I'm hanging out at home about an hour ago and he sends our group chat a picture of the sign at the restaurant with him saying ""suck it nerds."" So now that they're at the restaurant I got inspiration from [this scene](https://youtu.be/_tAYhl4wLB4?t=33) in Always Sunny and called the restaurant. I talked to the hostess and she was totally fine with me sending a bottle of wine to their table over the phone. I tell her which wine, give her my information, and then describe him to her. ""He's a tall, thin ginger man with a massive beard, glasses, and his name is Greg (name changed for reddit)."" She puts me on hold, walks around the restaurant, comes back and tells me she found him and his girlfriend. Perfect! I tell her to go ahead, tell him its from me, and to charge my card and leave the waitress a nice tip for doing a silly thing.  
  
An hour goes by and I hear nothing in the group chat. I finally message him and ask how the Tapas is. He says ""Oh we're not there yet, we're at the brewery getting drinks first. The reservation is later.""  
  
[MFW](https://i.imgur.com/KZRH8a8.gifv)  
  
I tell him what I just did and everyone in the group chat loses their minds. Apparently there was someone who fit that exact description in the restaurant and I just sent him and his girlfriend a bottle of wine from some random guy they don't know. This is honestly 100% more hilarious than if it actually went to them.

TIFU when teacher tries to embarrass me in class,"I made the mistake of taking a 9am class this semester. I go to a community college and live about 40 minutes away so if you do the math I have to wake up at least by 8:20am to be on time (what was I thinking?). My class has a good amount of kids, more than the average size but not too large. My teacher has a very monotone voice and speaks slowly so when he was going over a test I did relatively well on I chose not to pay attention (I got a 98 but with the curve it was a hundred). I resorted to r/tifu for entertainment. I was reading the story about the person who glued their butt cheeks together, and of course I had a huge grin on my face and was trying desperately not to laugh as I was reading more of the details. My professor suddenly hits me with the classic ""why don't you share with the class what you find so funny?"" Since the class was huge I became very embarrassed and tried to defuse the situation with ""nothing."" It didn't work and the teacher kept pressuring me to make me uncomfortable. I had no choice so I decided to briefly describe what I read ""I was laughing at a story on Reddit of this guy glueing his butt cheeks together."" My teacher was shocked and the class started dying. I was then asked to leave class and I'm sure my professor hates me now. I later found out that he started a new unit today so I missed all the notes as well.

AITA for having sex with my sister in law on the wedding night.,"Hey reddit,

I was best man for my brothers wedding, the maid of honor was his brides sister.  I am 24m while the sister (katie) was 20f.  We really hit it off right away.  We study the same subject in school, shes witty and funny and we got along really well.

Day of the wedding my brother and dad pull me aside and give me strict orders not to talk or initiate anything with katie.  I said that would be hard as we literally walk up the aisle together.  He said that was fine but other than that no contact, he then turned to me and said ""This is my day, I can tell you like her by the way you guys, stop being so selfish bro and be a good brother for once in your life"" This shocked me as we had a good relationship but i get he was stressed.

Wedding was going well and I obeyed them for the first part of the day, she wanted to dance but I said no.  She looked hurt and confronted me when I was getting a drink.  She said ""We were having so much fun before the day of the wedding, what changed?  I really like you and want to get to know you better, do you feel the same way""?  I said yes, and apologized and we danced.  

My dad forcibly tried to pull me off the dancefloor but i ignored him,  I got a text from my brother during the party that I was not to talk to her.  I replied dude wtf i get its your day but whats the deal?  We ended up making out after my brother left with his bride to the hotel.  We went back to the hotel holding hands, and laughing and we finally kissed.  Well we had sex in my room and i got her number and we are going to have a real first date this week.

I got a text from my brother later that day that his new wife told him what happened and he was extremely angry and couldn't believe I was so selfish.

AITA for not paying for an equally extravagant wedding for my oldest daughter?,"We have two daughters, Jody who is 26 and Hanna who is 28.

Both of them are engaged to two wonderful men who we adore.

My wife and I have saved roughly $50k for each daughter as a wedding fund. We aren't rich people so it took us years of being careful with our finances to help pay for half their college and this wedding fund.

We sat down with both my daughters separately to talk about their wedding plans. They did not know we had a fund for them. This was probably our first mistake.

Hanna immediately said she did not want a large wedding and would rather save money for a house deposit. She was going to do a courthouse wedding followed by a reception next year. So my wife and I agreed we would give her the wedding fund for that purpose. Again, we didn't communicate any of this with her. A huge mistake in hindsight.

Jody wanted a decent sized wedding. Something the fund would've covered.

My wife and I decided to pay for several of our family members from out of the country to attend. We knew it would be expensive but we knew we were only having one traditional wedding and we hadn't seen some close family close to 20 years.

Unfortunately, the costs started going out of control and we ended up taking $15K out of Hanna's wedding fund to cover the difference. At the time, we felt ok doing this because the extra costs of the wedding were due to our decisions, not Jody's.

The wedding happened a few weeks ago and it was perfect.

The problem now is that Hanna is aware we paid for most of her sister's wedding. She isn't aware about the costs and that we had to use some of her wedding fund.

A week after her sister's wedding, she came to us and said she changed her mind after seeing how beautiful it was. That she too wants a wedding like that with all of our extended family.

My wife and I had to tell her there was no way we could pay for all the extras again because we thought it'd be a once in a lifetime situation. We told her we'd be giving her around $35k for a house deposit and hosting her reception at our home.

Hanna had a complete meltdown and accused us of playing favorites. She left in tears.

She is now telling us she's too busy to meet for dinner or lunch when she used to drop by a few times a week.

This situation has now reached other members of our family who are chiming in.

This has been killing us. My wife told me we should just take the other $25k-30k from our savings to make this smooth over.

A part of me agrees but a larger part of me is angry that we have to mess with our retirement just because Hanna changed her mind. And I know part of her decision change is because of the constant competition our daughters have had growing up. 

AITA for thinking everything should stick to the original plan? My wife disagrees with me.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by stumbling across my mom's affair...,"(I started writing this when the whole situation first happened, but it started to get more and more complex, so I've been waiting to get as much info as possible, and it's been about two months since the first incident.)So here's some background information, my parents have been together 19 years. My dad's the real provider for the family, he was in the military for 26 years, but retired after being hurt in a car accident. He still makes good money off his new job and Veteran's Affairs checks. My mom spends a lot of his money on clothing and purses and other stuff, but it's kind of okay because she's a stay at home mom. The one thing I was always upset about her was that she traveled a lot, never taking any of my family with her. Me(16M), and my two little brothers(11) never have traveled anywhere with her. With that out of the way, here's the story. I was just playing Red Dead Redemption 2, and my mom came down to watch me play because that's her way of interacting with me. She kept asking questions about the story and stuff, and I'd tell her to listen to the characters and cutscenes but she wouldn't listen because she was just texting on her phone. Eventually, I was annoyed and said, ""Let's see what's keeping you busy."" I tried to grab the phone jokingly, but she got scared and pulled away, which got me interested. I left the room and five minutes later, I came back and took her phone right out of her hands while she wasn't looking, she started screaming and chasing me around. I tried to read but I couldn't read the texts, but I recognized the name(we'll call her V, who's a female). She was upset and left, and I figured something was up because if there was nothing to hide she wouldn't have acted this way. So I knew something was wrong. I acted distant the next few days because I was worried about what was wrong and that she was hiding stuff from me. A couple days past, and she sat me down before school, and asked me what I saw on her phone. Now since I didn't know any specifics, I didn't want her to know that so I just said, ""You tell me.""  That's when she basically said, ""You saw what I was talking to V about. How I like-like her.""  And guess what happened the next day. My dad told me he knew that I knew. WHICH MEANS HE KNOWS ABOUT THE AFFAIR!!!! He said  that he doesn't like it, but he has a couple reasons for tolerating it. 1.He still loves her, 2.He doesn't want to break the family up, and 3.She says she's ""exploring herself"" so he feels like it would be unfair to give her an ultimatum. I was pissed. My dad is sacrificing so much, including his self respect and happiness, and my moms sleeping around with her best friend. 

Now about two months have passed, and my dad is still unhappy, my mom still doing this, and she's barely at home anymore. She's at V's house 24/7 basically.(Another fun side note, V also has a husband and two kids, and her husband also knows and is also very sad and upset with this).

And the worst part is, my mom keeps making me and my dad hang out with V. She'll make us have dinner with her and her family, and it's so awkward and painful. I'm just really pissed off that my mom is just tearing apart my family and making us unhappy, just for her sake. 

For those of you that read this far, thank you for listening, and I hope you don't fuck up like I did.
Moral of the story is don't read other people's phones...

TLDR:I read my mom's phone, stumbled across her affair with her best friend, and my family's falling apart, yay!

EDIT:To the people(and I say people even though I only saw one guy say this) who are saying I'm an asshole for looking through my moms phone, yeah I fucked up, it's in the title, but I don't think it's all that fair to call me an asshole when looking at this entire situation.

EDIT: Also I'm stupid for not mentioning this earlier, but the affair has lasted longer than I've known about it, it started around last August, sorry I feel like that was something I should've mentioned",tifu

TIFU by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother,"Now this TIFU didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

So, a few weeks ago I was at my GF's house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.

This is where the fuck up happens.

After around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

I'm enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

She starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I'm already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can't, it feels too good. 

Right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I'm there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

I sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

Although me and my GF are still together, I haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

TL;DR - GF was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and I ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit.",tifu

TIFU by taking a bath with my girlfriend,"Obligatory this happened two months ago

My girlfriend and I were sick and congested.  We were sitting on the couch and she said she was going to take a bath and put in eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil.  

She then asked me if I wanted to join.  Sure, laying in a hot bath sounded really nice.  She went downstairs to grab our towels and I started the bath.  As I put the oils in, I yelled asking how much I should put in.  I got the answer of only a little bit. 

Apparently our definitions of a little bit are different.  I don't know if you know how strong peppermint oil is, but i should be able to paint a picture.

As we climbed in the hot bath, I realized that my asshole was starting to feel like an ice cube was getting shoved up it.  

In my congested, mentally drained from illness mind, I said ""Hey babe, hot water rises right?""

Right away she looked back at me and screamed ""How much fucking peppermint oil did you put in?!""

I said I turned it upside down and maybe like 10 drops got out.  

So we jumped out, body covered in water with peppermint.  It burned like icy hot.  My balls were on fire.  My girlfriend starts crying from the pain, and is screaming.  I'm in the fetal position trying to wipe water off my balls. 

I then get the idea of jumping in the shower and seeing if getting the peppermint off of me was possible.  NOPE.  Makes it much worse.

Fast forward ten minutes, we are curled up on the couch both covered in multiple blankets trying to get warm.   It wears off on my girlfriend and she says she just feels numb, but it doesn't hurt anymore.  Takes me an extra 15 minutes for it to stop hurting.  

The heat from the blankets warmed me, but I felt like I had ice under my skin.  

Half an hour later, it went away.

And that's why I'm not allowed to draw our baths anymore.

Tl;dr: girlfriend and I are sick.  Decide to take bath. I put enough peppermint oil in bath.  My girlfriend and I get it seeping into our pores. Has the effect of icy hot.  Balls and asshole are in pain.  Girlfriend cries, we have to wait out the pain.  

Edit:  Holy shit, this is in the top ten all time TIFU's.  I'm honored and ashamed.  

Things that I've learned since I posted this last night

1. A lot about essential oils

2. My girlfriend loves how everyone is reacting to this.

3. Too many people have had similar experiences.

AITA for not believing my girlfriend's 'discomfort' during sex?,"Pretty much says it in the title; whenever I initiate sex with my gf she winces in pain and says it's uncomfortable. Yet whenever she is up for it there seems to be no pain issue at all. 

Last night we were fooling around and I got her to orgasm through foreplay - zero issues or pain. I was pretty into it and initiated sex and instantly she was uncomfortable, despite me slowing down the pace. Finally after one thrust she yelled out in pain pretty much directly in my face which was the final straw for me. This has been happening for so long now yet she never does anything about it and tbh I doubt there is any pain - and if there is then she seems to be exaggerating it way out of proportion. I know that people will say no vagina, no opinion; but I know for a fact that I wasn't being forceful or rough so to downright scream in my face was totally unnecessary. 

She has no other symptoms or discomfort aside from this, and like I said if she initiates then miraculously there's no problem. It's not a lube thing either, trust me I've tried that too. 

I guess the reason I'm asking is because last night we kinda had a big fight about it. I lost my cool and told her how huge a turn off it is to see her face screwed up in pain all the time, and how I didnt think the pain was as bad as she was making out. I told her that sex was becoming really boring and I could pretty much predict how it would go each time. I also said the only solution  at this point was just to not have sex. She called me an asshole and went on the offensive. Said I have two moves and yet I expect her to be like a 'porn star'. 

So am I the asshole? Or should there be more give and take in this scenario? Can I insist she gets a medical check?

AITA for not deleting nude photos of a girl I legally own the rights to until she paid me back for all the rent she was supposed to pay.,"To sum up the entire story as quickly as possible. I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.

B and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rights to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. 

However she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.

She left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.

Two years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. 


She then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). 

I told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. 

I basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.

Never heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. 

This story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for getting a man on my train fined?,"Tl:dr - I recorded a man taking up two and a half seats for multiple stops and showed ticket officers the footage, getting him a fine. AITA?

So I get on my train after work at 6 in the city to the outer suburbs, everybody dashes for what seat are available and I snag one next to this biggish guy. This guy was pretty overweight, but if he sat properly he would be fine.

On Metro trains, seats are grouped in four like


oo  
oo

With another set of four across. I got the lower left seat, but this selfish yobbo was on the upper right and had one leg across on the other, and his other leg taking up half of the seat on his right (across from me) an asian man took the seat, but could only sit on half of it.

At first I thought this guy was sleeping. I shook his leg several times and asked if he could move his legs to no response, when my voice started to raise a person said ""just drop it mate, hes not moving"". So whatever, I left him to his coma. We hit Richmond, he wakes up, looks at me, looks out the window. AND DOESNT MOVE. 

So I see the asian man take a photo of his face, and I get an idea. Lets shame the asshole. So I take out my phone and start recording in selfie mode each time we arrive at the next stop, so the mic picks up the announcer saying ""now arriving at x"". I also shake his leg again, to which he tell me to bugger off. So now I can prove hes awake. Originally I was going to stitch it all together and post it in r/melbourne. But something better happened. When we got to one of the outer suburb stops, officers got on the carriage for inspection. He hears them asking for tickets and moves his legs. They come to us, I tell them, hey look at this. And show them a couple of the recordings.

They then issued him with a 180 dollar fine. Justice is sweet.

This happened two nights ago, and a couple of times I have been called a vindictive prick and that what i did was unnecessary. So, reddit. AITA?

UPDATE: (35M) CrashBandiChild claims I was merely setting a fire for attention.,"You guys? I can't.

First of all, I want to say a huge THANK YOU for the responses I received on my last post. It is below for your reference in case you missed the comedic shitshow that is this recent life experience.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cgw77v/my\_32f\_boyfriend\_35m\_got\_in\_an\_accident\_in\_my\_car/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgw77v/my_32f_boyfriend_35m_got_in_an_accident_in_my_car/)

I was straight up blown away by the support, suggestion, and compassion I was shown by total strangers. Some of y'all had me DYING laughing in one of the shittiest times of my adult life. A VERY kind gentleman from Scotland even offered to pay for my daughter to and I to go out to a nice meal together because he noticed in the thread that I mentioned I was a single mom. Reddit rules.

So. I know most of you said ghost him, but I just couldn't. While undoubtedly that is what he deserved, I needed to hear from his perspective why he thought any of this was okay before I could close the door. And honestly, I am glad I did because it solidified for me that this relationship was an excellent learning experience, that I had done my learning, and it was time to move the fuck on. 

His avoidance of the situation was explained by his thinking it wasn't that big of a deal. He said that he didn't understand why this lady was making such a big fuss about her bumper, and that I was unreasonably upset about it and he didn't want to talk about it until I had ""calmed down"". Oh. Hell. No. I kept it together until I got his side of the story. According to him, they were both backing out of their parking spots and smacked into each other. He was all the way out of his spot, she was halfway out of hers when BANG. I literally DIALED THE PHONE AND SAT WITH HIM while he called the insurance rep and gave his statement. He was found at fault due to his being all the way out of the spot. I am not 100% sure what this means for me, my policy, or my pocket yet.

As far as the relationship - done. When he came over to talk I had all his things packed up. I tried to explain how hurt and disappointed I was about his actions, and told that I could no longer trust him because of how terribly he handled this situation. He said, I shit you not, ""Oh, please. You just set a fire and expected me to come to your rescue and put it out and when I didn't you threw a fit. I'm sorry. I just didn't have the energy to put out your fire."" THIS IS YOUR GOD DAMN FIRE SET BY YOUR SHITTY ACTIONS AND FUELED BY YOUR AVOIDANCE. I burst into tears, handed him his bag, and said I needed him to leave. Now.  I told him anything of mine left at his place he can throw away, or leave there until his next victim or mother comes and cleans it for him.

Speaking of his mother, I did listen to you and craft a very detailed email to her with him CC'd. I explained what happened, and then asked her for his Driver's License number and policy name and ID number just in case its needed. Her response was, ""I am very sorry that you are having to deal with all this, but I don't see how this is our problem if it was your car"". I feel like this whole family are a bunch of lizard people sent to Earth to make me question my reality.

Anyway. Single at 32 again. Woot. I am **sad as fuck**, but trying to focus on the plus side as someone said ""cutting a bunch of deadass weight"". Thanks again for all the love and laughs.

Oh - and yes - once it is determined how much this is going to affect my rates and my pocket, I will be taking his cartoon quoting ass to small claims court. I have already spoken to my attorney about it.

Much Love,

Pixie

OMG - My wife hates me,"I'm totally at a loss for words.  Once again, my wife chose not to get me anything for my birthday - nothing.  We've been married for 27 years and I never forget her birthday.  And her gifts always cost me an arm and a leg - she has expensive tastes.  I always look forward to my birthday hoping that she actually goes out of her way and does something.  The last two years have been horrible.  So much so that I've been thinking of calling it quits after all this time.  My thinking goes as follows - if I'm not important enough for you to go out of your way and actually do something nice for me, why continue this farce?

&#x200B;

What got me this year was the excuse she used. I had relatives in town and took them out over the weekend.  This left her alone to do whatever she wanted. She had an eyelash appointment on Friday and a nail appointment on Saturday.  Sunday came around and my relative had an accident that necessitated a trip to the ER that evening. She decided to go to the ER for a completely unrelated issue.  On Monday, she told me happy birthday but she didn't get me anything because everyone was too busy on Sunday. Seriously? What happened to the other 364 days she could have prepared for it? And what happened to actually making an effort on Friday or Saturday?  I was pissed - not sure if she could tell.

&#x200B;

To make matters worse, on Monday she went out to a clothing store to buy new clothes.  I asked her for a simple gift card - she blew that off.  And next week she has surgery that isn't covered by insurance that I'm expected to pay.  I'm sure Father's Day will be more of the same.  I got her expensive tickets for her Mother's Day gift to see a concert in CA.  I'm already sure I'll get absolutely nothing.  It's just after all these years of giving, I'm done - this has sucked everything out of me. And I could do nothing for her special days, but then I'm riddled with guilt by her to no end.

A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered.,"Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.

The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.

The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.

TIFU by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years.,"This did happen today. My grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. She doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. One of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. She says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. So she keeps changing the position of my bed when I am away for work. When I come back, I reposition it my way so that I don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
Today, she was repositioning the room while I was there which annoyed me. So I took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that I was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. Infact I was pointing east . I instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. And she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. I pointed it out to her. I thought she would take it lightly. Oh man I was wrong. I fucked up biig time. She lost herself. She started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. I am looking at her old compass right now and I can say it doesn't seem right at all. I think I will have to fix this issue today itself. She is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. How stupid am I. 

TL;DR : I fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. She did not take it well . 

Edit 1: a lot of you are asking me how she moves furniture at the age of 90. Well she doesnt do it herself, she has a helper who is supposed to take care of her personally but my grandmother doesn't like the idea of employing someone particularly for her so she gives her household chores to keep her busy.

Then, this morning is when the fuck up happens. I'm chatting with some coworkers during break and someone asks me how my night was. My poor attempt at being funny was to respond with, ""It was pretty awesome, I saw a bunch of naked miners."" Everybody kind of froze and just stared at me....I didn't clue in for the longest time. I just stared blankly back at them. Nobody laughed at all and I could feel my anxiety closing my throat when it dawned on me. They thought I said naked MINORS!

In any case, I've blocked all of them and ignore calls. I personally think he is an emotional vampire/terrorist and that it is very unhealthy for me (and him) to continue supporting these delusions. 

So, AITA?

Edit: Thank you everyone. I wasn't expecting this to be so obvious. I guess it wasn't to me because of the relationship. He was a great friend for a long time. I echo everyone who said it sucks. While it's nice to see that so many people understand my position, there is no ""validation"" for me, Just the knowledge that I've lost a friend. As a note, I did mention the disorder to him and recommend he seek help. That is what triggered his anger. Thanks again everyone!

Edit: Thank you to everyone who informed me that the correct name for the disorder is: Factitious disorder. Also, it is complete speculation on my part. Strictly based on the external symptoms. No official diagnosis that I am aware of.",AmItheAsshole

AITA or rather AWTA - We told our friend that his GF is no longer invited to hangouts.,"We're a group of friends that have known each other since grade school. Our friend ""Paul"" has been with his GF ""Ella"" for 2 years going on 3. We met her after they had been seeing each other for 1 month and have known her since. Paul took us aside early on and told us she suffers from severe anxiety and depression.

&#x200B;

Our friend group is very close and hang out a least once a week. Paul brings Ella because she says she cannot be left alone due to her mental health issues. We didn't have any issues with this at first, but after 2+ years we are kind of tired of her for these reasons: If we are doing an activity that day that she doesn't enjoy, she will complain the ENTIRE time. She is picky so she has the final say in all restaurant choices. Despite being around us for 2+ years, if Paul gets up to get a drink or use the bathroom she will follow him. She also rarely speaks to us directly and kind of uses Paul as a sock puppet to tell us things. When she does speak to us directly, it's usually to call us out on something. Some examples include walking past a homeless man and not giving him money, spending too much money on X when you could have given it to charities instead, etc. mostly moral things.

&#x200B;

We have told Paul multiple times that her behavior (mostly the complaining part) is unappreciated. Every time he's tried to talk to her about it, he says it causes her to have a panic attack. We love to hang out with Paul and Paul gets very upset if we choose not to invite him to things because of Ella, but we're kind of tired of only doing things Ella likes and eating at the same 3 restaurants. So last week we told Paul that when invite him to things we are ONLY inviting him. We decided that Ella is invited to big events like Christmas parties and the occasional hangout, but only when we literally invite her. Paul did not take this well. He said we are being cruel to someone with mental health issues and are only going to exasperate her anxiety and depression. He also feels like we are basically asking him to choose her or his friends. 

&#x200B;

Side note: We're all in our mid twenties. This isn't about ""bro time"". Our friend group has women and men and we don't have any issues with any of our other SO's.

&#x200B;

So, are we the assholes?

Anyone else feel like being on-call for work ruins their free time even if they don't get called?,"After a long day of work, I like to unwind by enjoying a few drinks or vaping a bit of weed. But if I'm also on-call in the evenings for work, I have to remain sober just in case. Additionally, due to the nature of my particular job, I have to have computer/VPN access if I get called, effectively planting me at home all evening even if I wanted to go out. I've only had to respond to an actual work emergency like twice last year, but the looming anticipation of needing to be ready to solve problems seems to just ruin any chances of truly enjoying the couple hours I get to myself.

"A bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back.","Basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. My account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


I went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. He said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. I get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but I said I still wanted to press charges. The officer said I literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

So i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

I was refunded the 5k to my account, but now I have a shit load of overdraft fees because I use PayPal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, HBO, etc.) Every time PayPal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. I've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but I only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. I do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and I can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. Every time I check my account, it's just further in the negative and I don't know what to do.

My (20F) boyfriend (21M) wouldn't pay for my meal when I forgot my wallet,"Basically the title. 

Usually on dates, we split the bill. I don't really care like in the past, I've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. Like we'd go back and forth. 

My current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. From the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. I was fine with it, I didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. Paying on a date is sweet to me and I like it but I have my own job so it's whatever. I figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

Anyway I didn't really have any problem with it. But we went out to some random spot. Like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. So he went down the line and he got his own meal. I ordered mine and then when I went into my bag, I realized I forgot my wallet at my house. I told him that I forgot it by accident and I thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

I was just like what the fuck..? This guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and I paid him back through cashapp. After we ate, I lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city.

TIFU By Becoming an Accidental Active School Shooter,"This happened in the Oughties. TL/DR below.

My (relatively small) HS held an unexpected Live Active Shooter drill.  It was the first time they had ever done this. I don't know who developed this genius procedure. It actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

We had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. The teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... The trauma would help us react better? No idea. In fact, I remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.

However, it so happened that I was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. My teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. Now I understand why. (His mistake, but I played my part soon after)

On my way to the office (I was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. Emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. I was truly in a WTF state.

Here's where I F-up. Now I am the only dummy walking the hallways. Given the layout of this building, when I tell you it was dark, I mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. And it was completely silent now. It all happened in a matter of seconds. I can't say I was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. Still, given my aversion to our principal since I was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, I just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. I assumed my teacher knew what was happening and I didn't want to be in more trouble so I just yelled

**""HEY LET ME IN!!""**

The entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. This coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as I recall.  (Again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

Now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and I'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice I had heard in my life said

**""GET ON THE GROUND!!!""**

There was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! So whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought I somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, I don't know. He did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. He grabbed me up and took me to the office.

The rest was a huge blur but essentially I was not punished for THAT, but I got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. There was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. Parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

&#x200B;

TL/DR: Became unaccounted for just as an Active School Shooter Drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people.

I was never big into 'treating myself' or any self care but my friend's mom is into it. She got me a gift card to lush and I got the first and subsequently last bath bomb of my life. It smelled so good, and was so aesthetically pleasing. 
I take the bath and dropped the bomb in. I felt like I completed something in a teenage girl task book, but there was glitter on everywhere. I can not  emphasize every where enough.  I had to scrub myself raw several times to get most of it off.  
I just thought, well whatever. A few days went by and I had a mild amount of pain in my pelvic region. I had an upcoming obgyn appointment to take out my IUD which worked out well timing wise. As the NP went to take it out, she told me there was glitter in my cervix. Not just a few flecks but a decent amount. To quote her, it's like a disco in here.

TIFU by not sleeping and ending up with permanent brain damage,"This happened almost a year ago exactly, on January 2nd.

I've snowboarded almost my entire life, and would consider myself decent. My dad got a hold of me the day before this happened wanting to go on our first ski trip for the season. 

Now the prior season I had damaged one of my boards beyond repair and hadn't gotten around to getting a new one, so I decided to use an old one (first mistake). I stayed up all night stripping it down and giving it a new paint job. Didn't get a minute of sleep. In my sleep deprived state, I accidentally switched my left and right binding when I put them back on, didn't wax the board, and forgot my helmet when I was loading up the car.

6+ hour drive later, get to the resort and realize I forgot my helmet, and stupidly thought I'd be fine without one because I've snowboarded so long. First trip down the slopes went alright, but second trip down I'm having problems controlling the board because the bindings were switched, and I didn't wax or edge it. I hit a patch of ice and catch way too much speed and my two options are hit the little kid that just cut in front of me and definitely hurt him, or go off what I **thought** was a short drop off to the side of the trail.

Of course I decided to go off the very much not short drop off. End up falling ~15 feet before the tip of the board catches in ice, slamming me head first into the hard ice. Roll another 50 feet so so, hitting every imaginable spot on my head. Almost blacked out, super out of it. I sit there for 20 minutes, board snapped in half, goggles and hat 50 feet behind me.

Finally manage to get my stuff and get down the hill to find my dad, who refused to get ski patrol cause it was ""just a headache"". Called them myself, got told I was fine and eyes rolled at me. Dad drives me 6 hours home instead of taking me to the hospital down the road. Mom proceeded to take me to the hospital, where it was confirmed there was some heavy brain damage.

Fast forward through a year of countless appointments with neurologists, occupational therapy, hospital visits, missing almost the entire last semester of my senior year and nearly didn't graduate, and took a semester off before I start college. I'm left with ADHD like problems, mood swings, horrible coordination, problems sleeping, a stutter on occasion, and many other problems.

Wear your helmet kids.

TLDR; Didn't sleep, didn't wear a helmet snowboarding, permanent brain damage and problems for likely many years to come

"(Brooklyn, NY) At what point to a contact the police/a lawyer about the mystery sack found buried under my back yard.","This is not a joke. I have pics to show the mods, if they so desire.

&#x200B;

2 years ago, my partner and I bought a townhouse in Brooklyn. We ignored the back yard the first summer - too much going on inside. This summer, we have started trying to clear it out, which is a real challenge. My home was previously a 3/4 way home (between a half way home and full independence for substance abusers) and the back yard was/is littered with needles, broken pipes, other drug paraphernalia, buttons, marbles (no idea), and a shitton of broken glass, mostly beer and liquor bottles. I spend a few hours each weekend day carefully eliminating the weeds, then digging into the ground for a few inches with a spade and a hand rake, carefully sifting through the soil, picking out broken glass and the larger rocks. We have previously found random chunks of concrete, as well as broken bricks, unbroken bricks and cored concrete blocks.

&#x200B;

Today I was digging and found a rock that felt fairly big, so I dug under it a bit with my spade, then got my shovel out, so I could lever the rock upwards and see if I could lift it myself or leave it for my husband. It ended up being about a 1'x1'x4"" slab of what I would guess is ripped up vintage hexogonal bathroom tile, set on a concrete matrix. An interesting find, but also irritating - we have so much rando construction garbage in our yard to get rid of.

&#x200B;

Underneath, I discovered some more tiles that are potentially vintage - a seaform green and some other small chunks that just look old. Mixed with the tiles in the soil I found 3 alcohol bottles, empty, open, intact. 2 beer, 1 that looks to be liquor. Also mixed in were big enough chunks of broken glass that I currently estimate there were 2-3 other bottles mixed in.

&#x200B;

After digging up that, I hit some weird rock. It broke easily, was uneven in thickness, but overall, quite thin. At the thickest, it's maybe 3/4"". at the thinnest, 1/4"". It breaks easily, I dig it out.

&#x200B;

I am now about a foot below the surface, wondering how far I need to dig to get to the bottom of this refuse.

&#x200B;

Under the weird rock, there's a bit more soil, then I see something pink and soft. I brush it off. Imagine an ikea bag, but sturdier. That kind of plastic woven and sealed together. But pink. There's some kind of sack below this large slab and all the other things I find. I don't know how big it is, I've only uncovered about a 4"" square part of the top. I have no idea where the sides are, or how deep it goes. It seems to be fully and totally sealed still and I think would require a good knife to slice open.

&#x200B;

At this point, on a hunch, I go back to the weird ""rock"". I break some, and find that what I was beginning to suspect is true. This isn't rock. It's hardened tar.

&#x200B;

So buried in my yard is a pink sack (maybe once red and faded to pink) of unknown size, covered in soil, then covered in tar, then covered in soil mixed with empty booze bottles, then topped with a large slab of concrete flooring, then covered with several more inches of top soil.

&#x200B;

My husband is working until 1:30am today, and once I realized that someone covered this sack with tar, I got freaked out enough to stop digging. I have no idea what is in that bag. I could be some previous family trolling us and making a weird time capsule. It could be someone's beloved deceased pet, I guess. Lastly, given this was a 3/4 way house that was run illegally and the man running it is now in jail, it could be all kinds of fucked up shit that I don't want to know about.

&#x200B;

So, my questions:

&#x200B;

1. Should we keep digging and open this sack on our own?
2. If now, lawyer first? or Police first?
3. If lawyer (now or later) what kind?
4. What should I be aware of in dealing with the police? Is it safe to explain the circumstances at all, without a lawyer present?

&#x200B;

I took photos every step of the way, from the moment the medium-sized rock I thought I was digging out of the yard turned out to be a slab of what looks to be antique tile flooring. I shared these photos and the surprise with friends online, as it started out as a ""look at this kinda cool, but annoying shit I found in my yard today!"" thing, before it went into creepy wtf territory.

&#x200B;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Masturbation / Jerking Off is and should be a profession sport and in the olympics,"Hear me out here - This sport isn't like the other sports. It would test the durability, patience, and strength of a man. Nobody realizes how tough it is to jerk off for 10 straight minutes without busting a nut. That's why we should have the absolute professionals all do it in one place on Tv. I don't think it would be nsfw, we can just keep the camera on the pools of cum on the ground.  Jerking off is a very tough test and requires a lot of concentration, and I have plenty of ideas for this.

**Name**

Professional Jerking / Jerking

**How the game is played**
I think professional jerking can have many different concepts, so let's just set this is for the *Olympics*.  We bring 50 of the worlds best masturbaters, and bring them into the arena. Think about it, the lights and sounds, the chants, as we prepare for the first profession jerking. 

We start with round 1, the players get to chose what they want to watch and the clock stars 20 minutes down, every player has to jerk with condiments of there choice. Last one to nut wins. First five to nut are eliminated. Then, we do it again with a 20 minute break for advertisements and to regenerate nut power, as we go on to round 2. 

We repeat the process over and over, until we reach a final 5. Last one standing. Now they have to jerk to each other. *First* to nut wins. As they watch their same gender opponents and try as hard as possible to jerk to their sweaty, white dicks, with how gay it is, they have to bust. First one to cum wins.

*League*
It's be call the PJL.- Professional jerking league, and the league subreddit would be r/ProfessionalJerking.

That is all. I have a dream that this could happen  one day. Sorry in advance for any formatting issues i'm on mobile

edit: In no way would the camera work be nsfw, they would have ""pan cams"" where they show cum that's coming out, but the dick is censored. There is also a large crowd that fits about 20,000 around them",unpopularopinion
Update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. I'm back after 6 months.,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",legaladvice
AITA for asking my wife for an abortion.,"Me (31m) & my wife (29f) are very vehemently childfree. We're not one of those nutters who calls kids crotch fruit or spawn or whatever godforsaken name there is, but it was an agreement that we had very early in the relationship that we wouldn't have kids.

Now I've been putting off getting a vasectomy, I did get one a few weeks ago but I was just procrastinating it which was my fault I guess. However I used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good. So about 2 weeks before the vasectomy, me and the wife were getting down to business and I realized that I'd ran out of condoms, she reminded me that she's on birth control so we proceeded with the deed. I go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything's all good.

Nope. She's now six weeks pregnant, I was surprised cause isn't she supposed to be on birth control? Come to find out that she hasn't been taking it for at least a few months now. On top of that, she wants to keep the kid which I am very against, she's very fucking ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she's against having kids too. I feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows I'm very against kids and not only that but I was a foster child and don't know anything about my parents so I have no clue what inheritable diseases I may have. 

I really don't want to have a kid. So much so that I'm thinking of divorcing her if she's not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest I might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control. 

I have told her that I'm against this pregnancy but I haven't pushed any further than that. Would I be the asshole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?",AmItheAsshole

Update: I am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents.

Can someone help me please?,"I posted this a few weeks ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i\_am\_supposed\_to\_have\_money\_put\_aside\_for\_me\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i_am_supposed_to_have_money_put_aside_for_me_for/)

I just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). I was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

He was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. One of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). Unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

He gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

I also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* They both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. They aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* Apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. With her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. So now she is paying her way. 

Anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

TIFU by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.,"I'm in my third year of University taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. To start the semester I ended up missing the first week of school because I was on a last minute trip with my friends. It was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since I technically couldn't afford to go.

Anyway, I came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. On both those days I have classes all day until 2pm so I usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. So my first tuesday home I ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. So as part of my degree I have to take microeconomics which all I knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. When I get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so I just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

This goes on for 3.5 weeks. I came to class. Took notes. Then did the weekly assignments. On the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is Febuary 1st. So the class before the exam, January 30th, I decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. Now I was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was ALL theory based while the class was heavy math based. I understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. I explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*Explains above about material*
Prof: ""What do you mean theory? All the assignments are filled with math. Are you using launchpad?""
Me: ""No the assignments are online. Like the website we bought the textbook from. Whats lauchpad?""
Prof: ""Pardon? I don't have a textbook for this course.""
Me: ""It literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*Shows syllabus*
Prof: ""Wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
Me: ""What do you mean...? This is ECON 202 right?""
*Prof starts laughing*
Prof: ""Haha this is ECON 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. This is a new one, I've never experienced this before.""
Me: ""Well this is awkward. I better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

I then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. I caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. Even showed him my ECON 301 notes to prove I couldn't make this shit up. He just laughed and said the same thing ""This is a new one for me."" Turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. Same with the midterms. They were relevant because it was obviously a level above what I was supposed to be doing and the only thing I got wrong was the building code. They were both classroom 112, just different buildings. So basically I just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. Wish me luck tomorrow!

Tldr; I was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until I finally realized. Then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. Crazy coicidences all around.

Edit: Well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""You made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". The exam is in a couple hours and I will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. Ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but I had fun and went to Tiesto's birthday in Vegas amongst other kool stuff. Life goes on.

2. I was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and I had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). So I do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. He did everything on the board and there were online notes but I figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. I highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. It's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. I've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so I'm sure it will turn out fine. It'll be a funny story at grad when I get my ring.

Thanks for all the support too. :) Making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

Edit 2: Just got back from the exam.. I didn't crush it but there is no way I didn't pass. It was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. The prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""I usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm I will take the average to make up that first exam."" So all in all I survived and live to fight another day.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. I will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. In the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""Literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. But somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - CZ

I've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what I made on day-care.

So in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""Good luck with the mortgage and bills, I've taken MY money out of our bank account and turned off your card on MY credit"". I would say I was shocked, but I really am not. He's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

I obviously need an attorney, I logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. What resources can I begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until I can find childcare and a job?

"If Tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.","Tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. I can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. I have friends who have been fat fished. That's essentially the same damn thing. Why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. It's so fucking dumb to me. A girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""You go girl!"", ""Girl power!"", blah blah blah. A guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""Asshole!"", ""So misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. It annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&#x200B;

Let me be clear, **I have no issue with a woman if she is fat. I am just not attracted to it. Also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because I'm 5'9""** 

&#x200B;

Yes I'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to Bumble, and it's not as bad as something like Hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. While this is about Tinder's new settings, I think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

"The word ""retarded"" shouldn't be offensive","The fact that society is shying away from ""the r-word"" is proof of the so-called euphemism treadmill. Basically, by replacing ""retarded"" with something else, we're just kicking the can down the road and it's a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive. 

Not that long ago, the term ""retarded"" was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like ""idiot"" and ""imbecile"" (those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago). 

The term ""special"" or ""special needs"" is probably the most common way of replacing ""retarded,"" but even those terms are becoming offensive (for example, conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives ""special snowflakes""). 

Obviously human decency should prevent us from making fun of those with mental disabilities, but it just isn't necessary to tip-toe around those clunky terms that become offensive after a few years.

TIFU by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door,"Throwaway account because obviously.

My boyfriend and I are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. We got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. We're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. I started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so I figured on going to completion. Unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

So there I am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. His mom comes in! I freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. Meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. Eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

Anyways, it's 5:40am, I've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

TL;DR: Bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

Update @7:31am - Thanks for all the reassuring comments. My bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. Anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. More to come.

Update @8:38am - Of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... Anyways thanks! So breakfast started off totally fine. I mean, yeah I was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. That is, until I excused myself to go shower. She stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. But then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". It was sweet and cringy all at once. I guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

Anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

Update: A lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. Actually I assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); I didn't actually see her do it. I asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while I was...ehm...cleaning.",tifu

TIFU By trying to fly my drone at my sisters wedding reception,"So this had actually happened about a week ago.

&#x200B;

I wanted to shoot some cool overhead footage at my sisters wedding reception, and it was a pretty windy day. I go for this shot where I start close, and fly out backwards, zooming away from the party. Just as I do this, there's a strong gust of wind that pushes my drone backwards soooo fast I didn't have enough time to react as it went into the trees.

&#x200B;

Now this is a DJI drone so its got sensors to try and keep distance from objects automatically. The drone kept getting stuck in branches, getting itself out of them, only to fly right into another branch. All while this is going on the whole wedding reception is gasping and moaning because I was *sooo close* to flying it out of the trees!! All of a sudden it flips over sideways and that was it.

&#x200B;

*SPLOOSH*.

&#x200B;

Into the water below. Yeah. There was a river, forgot to mention that. The drone had tumbled through the branches bouncing off each one just barely slipping out of their clutches, only to meet its ultimate demise into the depths of the river.

&#x200B;

This was quite the spectacle for everyone at the reception. But it gets worse.

&#x200B;

As people were coming up to me and sharing their condolences, a few mentioned the same crazy idea, ""*you gotta go into the water and retrieve it"".*

&#x200B;

I'm fully dressed up for this wedding, and realized what that meant. I juggled the idea around in my head for a few minutes before I realized I had already lost my drone, can't get any worse from here. So, I stripped down to my underwear, in front of the whole reception. Everyone was shocked someone was already taking their clothes off despite not having consumed any alcoholic beverages. I stand at the edge of the water, look down, and-

&#x200B;

""*SIR!!! DO NOT JUMP IN THAT WATER!! We have someone on their way to help fish your drone out of the water.""*

&#x200B;

You see, the wedding was at a private park, and apparently some of the staff had caught on that I was about to jump into the river, which apparently was off limits. Of course they waited til I had stripped down to tell me someone was on their way. So here I stand, pretty much naked, in front of the whole reception. Everyone is just staring at me dead quiet. All of a sudden my grandma starts laughing and runs to me asking someone to take a picture of us, with me still in my underwear. This was quite the hit, as everyone found themselves wanting to come up and take pictures with me.

&#x200B;

Shame. Embarrassment. Sorrow. I'm not sure which emotion I felt more, but I had accepted my fate at this point, and had no other choice than to stand there while everyone laughed and took pictures of me, as I was cold and vulnerable.

&#x200B;

I finally get my clothes back on, when the staff shows up to get the drone out of the water, *with a little fishing net.* The water was 12ft deep, while the net was like 4ft in length max.

&#x200B;

And that was it. My drone, along with my dignity, were lost forever that day.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**  I stripped down in front of a whole wedding reception to retrieve my drone out of the water. Staff wouldn't allow me to go in the water. Everyone at the reception laughed at me and got pictures taken with me basically naked.

Neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive,"Male, late 20's, CO

I quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven't consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. 
Here lies my issue:
This morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like ""The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I'm calling the cops. Any suggestions?

BTW, I didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

UPDATE:

The police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

UPDATE #2:

Both men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",legaladvice

TIFU by not locking my dogs out of the room during sex,"So this just happened last night. I should start by saying I have two wonderful, loving big dogs, a GSD and a lab mix. Usually when my fiancé and I start getting ready to rock and roll we lock them out of the bedroom to avoid any distractions. 

Last night however he woke me up around 1am to have a little midnight fun (he must've been having a good dream). I was about it, we started in, and let the good times roll. It was all going per usual, he was done, I was making my steady climb up the hill to heaven. My eyes were closed and I was not being very quiet. Right as I was about to start my journey back down to earth I feel a long wet tongue on my face. Open my eyes, my GSD is standing in my face looking worried and trying to kiss me. 

Let me tell you, there is no quicker turn off and end to a climax then getting kissed in the mouth by your slobbery dog. I pushed my dog away and my fiancé just burst into tears from laughing so hard. 

TL;DR we started having sex in the middle of the night, forgot about the dogs. My GSD snuck up and mouth kissed me at my climax and ruined my night. 

Edit: I can't believe the most popular Reddit post I will ever have is about this... thank you strangers for silver and platinum! Also thank you to everyone who shares these experiences and so sorry to those who have gotten tongues to the butt... you win?

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

Thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given.",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] Am I [F22] wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiancé [F24] decided to publicly ""joke"" about my relationship issues in front of everyone?","First of all,  thank you to everyone who offered advice it means a great deal to me. I thought I would post a follow up considering the amount of traction this post received. 

So as some of you suggested, I reached out to my brother and expressed my frustration and sadness given the whole situation. I was not able to reach him through phone, so I ended up sending him a text detailing all this information. I didn't hear anything from him the rest of day so I started to wonder if he was just going to ignore my message. Then today I got a text from his fiancé  saying, ""Good morning [my name]. I didn't mean any offense when I said that comment the other night. I was trying to make light of the situation and kind of pump you up make you feel good? Like kind of a ""yay"" thing. I should have taken into consideration that we were in front of everyone & I don't know 100% what's going on. I know you were considerate about the pearl thing so I should do the same. I do apologize and didn't mean any harm, it won't happen again♥️"". 

I have mixed feelings about her response. While I do appreciate her reaching out and apologizing, I am struggling to believe she genuinely thought this would make me feel good, or in her words ""pump me up"". Right...because nothing pumps you up like having your relationship issues put on blast and shared to the masses? I received this message two hours ago and I have yet to reply. Like many of you suggested this seemed more a tactic for her to persuade how people see me. I do know for certain she is a very judgmental person (which gives me more reason to doubt the authenticity of her reply) . For example, I've witnessed on several occasions her be rude to waitstaff, talk down on other people's relationships, lives, and jobs. 

After further reading comments I have started to speculate she decided to publicly ""joke"" about my relationship issues in a desperate attempt to boost her own insecurities. For starters she does not allow my brother to go out to bars with his male friends because in her words ""those are not activities taken men do"". He's not allowed to drive his Camaro to the gym as she believes this will attract others girl attention. Also, as I'm sure you can conclude from all this he is by no means allowed to have any female friends. I could go on and on here, but you get the idea. Because of this I do wonder if she is trying to embarrass me publicly in an attempt to boost her self esteem. At a minimum I do believe it makes her a hypocrite. 

I am also little disappointed I haven't received a response from my brother. While he obviously relayed the message to her, it would have been nice to hear from him as well. As others pointed out it may not be in my best interest to confide in him going forward. As for my reply to his fiancé , I still am unsure what is the best course of action to take. Perhaps just let it go, and only press the issue if it happens again? I have a feeling this won't be the last time despite what she's said here. I will update you all here once I gather my thoughts and decide what I should say going forward. 

Edit for clarification: she noted how I was considerate given the ""Pearl"" situation. This is my lifelong friend of over 10 years. My brother and my friend pearl had a  brief fling that lasted a few months back in 2012. My brother came to me explaining how his fiancé was very upset that I would share funny stories about me and Pearl's  travels together in front of her. I apologized and explained to my brother I had no idea she even knew about their brief fling (given it was so long ago). I was a little surprised he even thought to mention it to her when he explained she somehow managed to find text messages between them on his phone dating all the way back to 2012. From that point on I was not allowed to even mention her name around my brothers fiancé, let alone invite her on any family outings (as I used to do frequently). She has even ""overheard"" our private conversations between me and brother where I've mentioned Pearl's name, to which she criticized my brother for not completely shutting down the conversation immediately. She's a real gem, I know.

[MA] HOA sued to have us join and lost. Now bills us for their legal fees.,"We bought a house in 2015 and we made damn sure that it's not part of an HOA. Soon after moving in the HOA started sending us documents about joining which we completely ignored. We were even visited once by the president of the HOA and my husband made it clear to him that we have no intention of joining.

In June 2016 we received a letter that said the HOA is considering legal action against us to have us join because by living here we are benefiting from the HOA's work without paying for it and it's a financial burden on everyone other member. The letter insisted that a legal action can be avoided if we agree to join. We ignored it.

The president visited us again in July 2016 and said the same thing, when we pretty much told him ""see you in court"".

They indeed took legal action against us earlier this year and we hired a lawyer and went to the court, their motion was dismissed immediately. We thought it's the end of it. But to make sure we had our lawyer send them a cease and desist letter to stop this constant harassment.

Now we received a letter from them, saying we need to reimburse their legal fees of about $3700 according to the article X section Y of the HOA's CC&Rs with a copy of the CC&Rs. The referenced paragraph says something along the lines of ""The association is entitled to recovery of the fees incurred by bringing legal action against the homeowner, as deemed necessary by the board to enforce the CC&Rs and preserve the best interests of the community"".

Out of the $3700, $2000 is related to their fees for suing us and the remaining $1700 are for the demand letters that they've been sending us during all these times.

We are so tired of fighting this horrible HOA and we are thinking whether we can be granted a restraining order against the HOA? What is the best way to fight this charge and make sure they will stop their harassment? ",legaladvice

[Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body,"Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one. 

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

The way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. And if it wasnt for Kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.",relationship_advice

"[Update] Seattle, WA- Mentally Disabled Neighbor has twice followed us to our front door and attempted to enter. What are our options?","[Original Post](https://redd.it/8san7h).

Thank you all so much for your help and suggestions. First, a few things to clear up:

-We are NOT trigger-happy people looking to kill our neighbors (contrary to what a few comments and nasty PMs said). My husband has a handgun because he enjoys going shooting, and for protection. I am not thrilled, but as long as he is safe about it, it's not worth fighting over.

-We did not know the man was mentally disabled until AFTER the first incident. I feel our fear was justified given that a strange man followed us and our toddler home and then tried to open our door and window.

-I actually have quite a bit of compassion for the elderly and the disabled. I went to the house to speak with the caretaker to figure out how we could all keep this from happening again. I understand his hesitancy to give me any info, but I was trying to help the man rather than get the caretaker fired or have his license taken.

Onto the update:

After posting here, I followed the top suggestion to contact Adult Protective Services and filed a report. After filing the report, APS also referred me to the Complaint Resolution Unit, which deals directly with caretakers and aides under investigation. Because this had happened twice in three days, APS moved fast to visit the home and get in contact with the agency running the group home (note: they kept calling it a group home, but as far as I can tell, the man who followed us is the only resident there). The agency was very apologetic and horrified that these escapes had led to police contact twice. I was told alarms have been installed on all exterior doors so staff is alerted when he tries to escape. They will be bringing in additional staff as well, to ensure that this man has 2 aides assigned to him at all times.

The APS investigator let me know that the man is non-verbal and only understands very simple instructions, so simply asking him to leave our property wouldn't work. She mentioned that he hates being alone and probably latched onto our family because we looked safe. Apparently he also loves dogs and she thinks that's what caused him to come over the second time (we were in the front yard with our dog). Moving forward, I will be trying to arrange a meeting with the agency to come up with a plan in case this happens again. I'd rather not involve the police if I don't have to, so hopefully they will give me a number to call if he appears at our house again. Ultimately I'm very glad that this man will be getting the care he deserves and needs.",legaladvice

TIFU by snorting a tonsil stone,"Bodily discharges are only for the weekends, so I'm reposting from earlier this week.

Like a lot of people, I sometimes get tonsil stones. And when I get tonsil stones, I remove them. Normally, this is a very straightforward process, but luck can only take one so far.

A few days ago, I had a particularly large and nasty tonsil stone stuck in a little tunnel in the back of my throat. Normally, they pop out without a hitch, but this time, my body had other ideas. No sooner had the stone come free, then my gag reflex went full Benedict Arnold, betraying my trust and forcing me to clamp my mouth shut in an effort to keep myself from vomiting. In my panicked attempt to continue breathing, I somehow managed to snort, bringing the tonsil stone straight up into my nasal passageways.

Under normal circumstances tonsil stones smell bad. Some would say ungodly. But this.

Some say that when Hercules cleaned out Augeas' stables, the metric fuckton of rotting filth was washed back into the river. However, I can say with confidence that all of this filth was lodged in my nasal passageways. Nothing else could possibly smell this bad. Having a tonsil stone in your nose is like going on a date with every drop of vomit that the human race has collectively Ralphed. Many tears were shed.

I blew my nose. I attempted to improvise a neti pot. I came thiiiiis close to pouring Listerine into my nostrils. I didn't think I was ever going to sleep again. Fortunately, it evacuated my sinuses one tiny, godforsaken chunk at a time over the course of about 3 hours, but the trauma had already been suffered.

TL;DR - I accidentally snorted a tonsil stone while trying to remove it, and all I could smell was the abyss of ass-rot.

People take life too seriously,"Who am I to say what people should and shouldn't be taking seriously right? However, I've noticed just HOW insecure so many people are about tiny things. They worry that their dress might be scrutinized, that their eye wrinkles will be analyzed or that something they said MIGHT make them look like a weirdo. Weirdo's and edgelords get discriminated against and belittled instead of understood or reasoned with. It's almost like people want to die the way they were born.

AITA for not tipping the pizza place on an order for 35 pizzas?,"Not my story, but my brother's, and I'm really unsure where I stand on it.

My little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. He organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a Friday. 

At the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a Monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a Friday, during lunch hour. They said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order Wednesday morning. 

He calls back Wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. The manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their Friday lunch rush. He recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following Tuesday.

Monday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. The manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. My brother tells him that would work. When asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.

Noon on Tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. Then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. 

While waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:

Manager: ""Are you going to leave a tip?""

Brother: ""No.""

Manager: ""Usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip""

Brother: ""You aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. When we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip"".

Manager: ""It's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity"". 

Brother: ""That isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. I'm not leaving a tip"".

Manager: ""Well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas"". 

At this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). My brother relents. He tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. He hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).

My brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker.

Me (15F) My mom (30sF) cares more about drinking and fucking guys than being a parent.,"Yo I'm 15 and utterly clueless how to deal with my ""mother""

That's in quotes because she doesn't act like one. Never has. I don't know who my dad was. Neither does she. Yep she's that kind of person.

None of my siblings dads are around. They're either locked up or didn't care or she refuses to talk to them for who knows why. She stopped persuing child support from the one she had contact with bc it was ""too much work"" but when she used to get the child support, she just spent it all on shit for herself. Like tattoos, alcohol, clothes.

She's addicted to online shopping, the apartment is stuffed with her shit and she doesn't even use most of it. Also she doesn't clean. I have to clean (I'm the oldest) or it doesn't happen. Before I learned to clean, we got tons of ants and flies, we had roaches for months before she finally was willing to pay for getting rid of them. Said she ""didn't want to waste money"", but she wastes money all the time on whatever she wants. Food and bills are an after thought. She has WIC but literally can't be bothered to get us food unless I nag her when we're flat out. Then she just loads up with garbage from the dollar store, so I'm really worried about my siblings, bc some of them are getting really overweight and she doesn't ever take us to the doctor and I don't even know if we've got health insurance.

She bounces around between temp jobs, nothing permanant, bc if she worked fulltime she couldn't party. She's almost always out at night sometimes during the day. Or she's passed out drunk. I've dragged her to her bed bc she blacked out in the bathroom or on the floor. Or, some random dude shows up after midnight hauling her in the door as she's unable to walk. How do these men have keys??? She just copies the key and gives it to literally ANYONE she trusts. Which is practically everyone, she has no idea who's a good person or bad person. As a result there are men who have touched me when I was younger. Now I can fight them and protect myself and my siblings. She never protects us. She doesn't care. She called me a liar bc that's her boyfriend so he wouldn't do that blah blah blah. 

There is a revolving door of these ""boyfriends."" They don't last longer than a year and even when she's with a guy guaranteed she's fucking at least one other. Me and my siblings can clearly hear the telltale slapping sounds and disgusting groaning and fakeass porno screeches coming from her room. It's happened at all hours of the night waking us up. We've even found nasty sex toys and fetish outfits in places outside of her bedroom.

She's pregnant right now (kid number 8) and STILL doing this. Still drinking too. I mean what the fuck, I started suspecting she's doing this for money (she's randomly suddenly had cash after nights like that after saying there was no money for food or whatever) and asked if she was a prostitute, she slapped me across the face. Well that's my answer I guess. I know she's been a stripper so it's more than likely. Anyway I still said why is she okay poisoning a baby and risking one of these abusive guys injuring it, she said I can't judge her until I'm a mother. So whatever. I'm never gonna be one looooool

Then, despite constantly being broke and relying on the minor government aid + whatever these fuckboys give her (she begs online for donations all over social media), she went and got a huge fucking boobjob a couple years ago. I was only 13 but I've been constantly aware of our poverty. I've been bullied for it, even my 5 year old brother got teased at school about his clothes. It's impossible to NOT be aware. I started learning when rent and bills are due to try to get my mom to keep on top of it so our electricity and heat stops getting shut off. Then she goes and buys fake tits. It's like, what is even the point. She's gonna blow her money every time no matter what I do.

I'm so scared and sick of always worrying about money. We've been evicted 5 times that I can remember. Utilities shut off countless times. Half the time I have to make my younger siblings ramen for dinner because it's all I can afford from the change she leaves us.

I'm so sick of the grossness of the apartment, the grossness of the men always coming and going, her dressing like a hooker, using her tits to get men now that she looks twice her age thanks to alcohol addiction, the trashiness of everything in my life. The apartment is 3 bedrooms with half the living room hosting me and my next oldest sister's bunk beds and the other half hosting my mom's piles of junk. The rest of my siblings are split between the other two bedrooms and then my mom has the third. Everyone's room is covered in clothes toys books and random junk on the floor, bc there's simply no space for anything that could store it. Garbage and masses of toiletries/cosmetics in the bathroom and mold in the shower. Garbage always overflowing in the kitchen. Dirty stove fridge and oven I can never stay on top of. Everything's old and falling apart. No AC or fans in 90+ heat. It's just shit. She couldn't care less she's hardly ever here so sees no reason to care.

I hate that I can't give my siblings a better childhood. I hate that she won't make a single effort to do that when it's her responsibility, SHE'S THE PARENT NOT ME, but I cannot stand to see them neglected. They all see me and my next oldest sister as parents more than her. We are ""their moms"" they say. We bathe them and dress them, do laundry when we can. We take care of each other when we're sick.

Please get one thing clear from my post besides that I hate my mom, it's that I love my brothers and sisters. I would do anything to make their lives just a little better. But I don't know how when we're stuck living in this place with this person. I realized we'll have to get out on our own for things to get better but even once I'm old enough, they won't be. I could adopt them but I doubt I could get custody of all 6 + the baby that's coming + however many fucking more kids she decides to pop out over the next 3 years.

Plus even though they listen to me about hygiene and chores they don't listen about school. No matter what I try, short of bribing with junk food I can't get them to do their homework. But I'm a hypocrit bc I don't always do mine either, I don't have time sometimes or I'm so tired I just can't.

Is there any way to make my mom be an actual mom? How do I at least get her to stop drinking while pregnant and stop hooking up with randoms. Like the older I get the more fucked up I see it is, and the angrier I am. I don't wanna hate everything but so many days I do.",relationship_advice
TIFU by flipping off my four year old neighbor.,"I'm a salty fucker. I'll admit that from the jump. I can't stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. I can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. He's a little fucking hellion. 

His hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when I get into my car and leave for work. I got so sick of being stared at by this little asshole, so I flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as I was getting into my car. He immediately started screaming and crying. As I drove off, I felt...weirdly satisfied. Seriously, it was the most fulfilled I'd felt in WEEKS. So, I immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. Each time he'd start screaming and freaking out. It made me bitterly happy.

This morning, as I was getting ready to leave, I saw the demon child in the window again...giving me THE STARE...and I flipped him off. Only this time I heard the bellow of ""HEY FUCKER!"". The kid's fucking dad had been standing behind him and I didn't see him. I sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the house. I got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn't stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.

"My (32F) boyfriend (35M) got in an accident in my car, didn't tell me, and now refuses to do anything about it.","Throwaway because this shit is embarrassing af.

I have been with my (32F) boyfriend (35M) for a little over three years.

Every once in a while I will let him drive my car when his is low on gas or if he has the good parking spot and doesn't want to move etc etc. A couple weeks ago I get a call from my insurance company letting me know they need a statement about the accident.

Um. What?

After a solid 45 minutes of adamantley proclaiming this lady was full of shit and that there was no accident the insurance rep said, ""Well we have a report that (boyfriends name) was in an accident in bla bla parking lot on this date claiming he was driving his girlfriend's car"". Oh.

I call my boyfriend, he denies up and down that there was no accident. I explain the call I received and he replies with, ""ooooooh yeah I forgot about that"". Apparently he had been dodging calls for over a month and did not tell me any of this was going on. There was no damage to my car, so there was no reason for me to think anything had happened. So, yesterday I was trying to work out with the insurance company details, get him to make a statement, and its impossible. He stopped responding to my texts about the situation so I call him. He clears it. I call him again. He clears it. He texts me, ""I am with my parents."" Okay, but this is a serious situation and I need to speak with you about it can you please answer? ""I don't want to fight with you in front of my parents."" This isn't a fight, I need details about the accident from you! He won't take my call. So, I send him kind of a shitty text something along the lines of, ""You can't even show me the respect to take my call about something serious? This isn't even a real relationship to you."" Silence.

Finally after about 2 hours of radio silence (and me very very upset) I call again. He says ...

""I don't have the energy to do this with you right now. I'm painting. I don't want to talk.""

I say ...

""What about my feelings? What about me?""

He says ...

\*scoff\* ""what ABOUT you?"" and hangs up. I haven't heard from him since. I know he is waiting for me to break down and contact, as that has historically been the case.

I need some help drafting my response to this situation. I am frozen in shock and pain and am at a loss on what the next step is.

\*UPDATE\* it is 12:15pm my time, and still not a word from this fool. He gives no fucks. I am done.

\*SECOND UPDATE\* So. He contacted. The text I just got was ""we have the kind of love that was forged in adventure, and sealed in the bedroom"" What!!? No mention of the accident or the fight? HOW DO I EVEN RESPOND TO THIS?",relationship_advice

AITA for feeding my vegan nephew meat?,"My sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. 

I usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew & son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. 

So basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year).

[UPDATE] $400 pet fee for a cat I don't own,"First things first, thank you everyone for all the help! I've settled things with management, and no longer have to pay the fees. The reason behind that is something I just had to share with you guys.

I managed to catch the cat after leaving a few bowls of food, and it turns out he does have a collar. It's just hard to see under all his fur. So I looked at the tags, hoping to find an address. There was one engraved into one of the tags, but there was just one small problem: The address was mine.

Luckily, there was also a phone number, and this one wasn't mine. So I dialed the number, and it turns out this cat (Butter) belongs to the people who used to live in my apartment. They moved to a condo across the street, and forgot to get new tags for Butter.

I explained my situation, and asked if they could tell management what was going on. They did, and less than an hour later, I got a call from the leasing office. They apologized for the ""misunderstanding"" and said I no longer had to pay the fees. Naturally, I made sure to get that shit in writing. I don't think Butter will stop visiting my balcony, but as long as I'm not getting in any trouble because of it, he's more than welcome to drop by whenever he feels like it.",legaladvice
TIFU by giving a homeless guy $80,"Preface: 
*Not trolling for money, thanks* 


So I'm a semi-broke grad student and Lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. I ran into CVS to grab something and I was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). I also paid in cash which I never do as I rarely carry cash. So I walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man I often see in my neighborhood. I give him a dollar here or there some days when I can. He's in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so I figure, hey, even though I'm broke (as in my bills are insane and I make just enough atm to live and support my family) I can still give my coat because I have a few decent ones, I'm dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so I give him the coat and he mumbles ""thanks"" and I smile and tell him to stay warm and off I go... later as I'm working I stop to grab gas and realize I put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. I would never go ask for it back (obviously) but I had a moment of semi- panic before I accepted that I just gave this dude all that money. Best ""screw up"" ever, I suppose. I'll live. I have to be totally honest and say I was upset at first but I'll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that I should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke I FEEL.

I (20m) was introduced to this girl (20f) and she is incredibly intimidating.,"I'm not sure what to do. This girl is a great and stable (first for me) and attractive and smart human being. I really like her and the friend who introduced us said the second I left her sight, she texted my friend about how hot I am which is a good sign. 

The thing is, I used to be able to draw back in like, 11th grade. She paints full canvases. I listen to music (but like really hard rock) sometimes I guess. She writes music, sings, and plays the piano. She's an accounting major when I'm in graphic design but only just started so all I can really show her is a super low effort picture I took so I could keep up with the class. 

This girl is incredibly intimidating to me. She knows all these ""show-off-able"" skills and tricks and they're really really cool and the best thing I can do is make fun of the shot-types used in Taken 3 and play video games. I have no idea how I can compare much less impress this girl and keep her interested. 

Note: we haven't even hung out 1 on 1 but there's obvious chemistry. Not enough to obscure the worries behind this post but we can hold an engaging conversation (neither of us have really talked about ourselves yet so idk if that even counts.)

Note 2, Electric Boogaloo: We've only hung out like, twice and it was always cut short. I know I'm overreacting. I just have no idea what to do about this.

By impress I mean more of keeping up with her than romantic comedy ""impress"" garbage and by show off I don't mean to show off I mean they're like party tricks or stuff you can physically show off to people or have proof you can do like a painting. I've got none if that.

WIBTA if I make my gf start paying some of the bills over a single incident?,"Edit:  Had the talk, it did not go well ha ha.  I just told her our money situation wasn't working for me anymore and we needed to figure something else out.  I told her I wanted her to starting paying for her phone, the electric, and the internet.  Combined usually around $175.   

I didn't bring up her attitude from last night, but right away she knew what that was.  She said I was being stupid, petty, a bitch, and some other things that I can't really remember atm.  She said she wasn't going to pay it so I told her that if she doesn't the next time those bills come around she can find a new place to live.   More insults before she stormed out.   I haven't heard from her since.  So I'm enjoying some jack and cokes and feeling pretty good about things for the first time since last night.  Cheers for all the support and advice.  I appreciate it.  













Gf and I live together.   She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. 

We went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she'd have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn't believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. 

It was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven't been able to get it out of my head since.   It's really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn't be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it's time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.

TIFU by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think I was a heroin junkie,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved to fiddle around with staplers. Playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. One of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. Running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200B;

This progressed from me messing around with staples in Ms. Grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. I had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? Well...

&#x200B;

Fast forward to present day. I am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. I have a home, a normal car, an office job. I am by all accounts a normal human being... **I still love staples.** Working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. I'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. It got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200B;

So I had to stop doing that...I turned to Amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. It wasn't enough. I went to 20, then 40. My wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". But I brushed it off as a work issue that I'd get reimbursed for and knew I had to change my methods.

&#x200B;

Over the course of a few months I enabled myself...I started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. I would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. I began to stay out late and tell my wife I would be home soon, so I could go buy more staples from different stores. I opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. She got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200B;

This past Thursday after one of my ""late nights"" I get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. I walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. Because it is.

&#x200B;

My wife asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. I sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". Then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. This man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what I had in the bag from multiple stores. It basically looked like I was a drug runner for Office Depot who was using some of the product for myself. At this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. I had to come clean and all I could muster was

&#x200B;

""I...I like staples.""

&#x200B;

The WTF looks I got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when I showed them my car....I came clean. I backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. Right now my only concern is my dad. He didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200B;

Believe it or not, I think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. I may or may not do that, but the good news is I now can have a ""staple hour"" once I get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought I was on drugs when it became a problem.

EDIT: 

Thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! I am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. If you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, I just ask that you DM me/name the throwaway so I can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. I went to see a therapist today with my wife. I was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, I do need help. I am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. Just tailored to my specific issue.

2. Apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. That included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. So after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. My wife initially thought I was having an affair. She didn't think I was doing drugs until she got the pictures. The PI just told her what he saw, and she deduced that I had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. She admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. I do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. I am just an addict, and an idiot. I know how stupid the addiction is and so I tried to hide it. It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things I guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",tifu

[USA-NY] 24 year old male. My doctor called and told my mother he treated my genital warts,"I had one genital wart removed and my insurance covered it fully. Later my doctor kept pushing for a skin biopsy on my chest that was completely irrelevant to my genital wart. 
I finally agreed and signed the paper after he told me how risky it could be for cancer. He performed the procedure but the nurse forgot to verify that the insurance is covering it. I understand I need to pay because I signed paperwork saying I'd be responsible if my insurance didn't pay. 

However he called my mother introducing himself as the doctor who treated my genital warts. Then he goes on to tell her he needs a few thousand dollars for the procedure. 

Is that even legal? I thought he wasn't allowed to reveal another condition unless it comes down to the insurance not paying. 

I literally told the doctor my family couldn't know about the wart and he tried to use it against me to scare me and my mom into paying immediately. My insurance kicked me off for doing so many unnecessary procedures with this guy. He would convince me everything could potentially be cancerous. 

I understand it's my fault for not doing my research and being gullible so I'll have to pay for that. However I'm pretty upset he had to tell my mom about my STI condition when there was no issue with the billing. He was paid and it was done over a year ago.

My older brother grabbed my ankles and the other my arms. I made it a little difficult though, I stiffened (which is probably easier) and I crossed my arms holding my elbows close to my torso so he didnt have anywhere to hold except a poor grip on my shoulders. 

Being the weak noodle I am, I couldn't hold my arms in long enough. He grabbed my upper arms and they carried me toward the stairs to the front door. I half expected they wouldn't bring me outside, but I knew they would go all the way even when I had no jacket or shoes.

I didnt want to be carried awkwardly down the stairs so as we got closer, I struggled. I kicked my legs with little effort because I didnt want to hurt anyone, and since that didnt really work I had an idea. Risky. I lifted my arms straight up so my brothers hands would lose grip an drop me. 

I dropped slowly since he was still trying to hold me with my arms up (I was wearing a long sleeve bunched at my elbows) but as I hit the floor I realized my shirt had lifted. My sleeves must have been pulled off my arms, lifting the rest.

It was over. My ankles were released. 

I put my now freed hands down over my chest and feel my nipple. Yup. The brother by my feet definitely saw. I noticed he was looking away at the moment, but I was sure he saw when it happened. 

Thankfully I am small chested, so I'm not as embarrassed as someone else would be. 
But it is still awkward to think about.

P.S. Sorry bro....

TLDR: decided not to wear a bra today. my brother saw my nipple.

"The word ""moist"" isn't gross. The circlejerk over it is ridiculous.","There seems to be this meme of the word *moist* being inherently disgusting and creepy, and I don't get it. Is ""damp"" really a better word to use? What sounds more appetizing, a *moist* cake or a *damp* cake?

Personally I think the words *petulant* and *hemorrhage* are a little bit gross-sounding, but they are words for a reason and I'm not going to throw a conniption fit if somebody uses them. It's not like they're slurs.

EDIT: I might have been a bit harsh in my wording. I know it's just my opinion, and some people are grossed out by it. I understand why some people have a negative association with the word, but I just don't associate it with bodily fluids unless it's used in that context. Obviously I'm not going to double down on using it if it truly does bother somebody. I'm not an asshole.

I mixed up the words *petulant* and *pustulent,* but the two words do sound somewhat similar. Obviously the reasons *pustulent* and *hemorrhage* are gross sounding is because of what they mean. I'm not going to avoid them if I need to use either.",unpopularopinion

So I want to start out by saying that I was wrong and I want to apologize to anyone I may have hurt with my last question. It was wrong of me to defend my brothers actions and I wish I could have seen that at the time but thats the past.

I went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. Me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. The owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. The girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said I felt that I needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. My parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs. 

&#x200B;

I really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn I was wrong. Like I said I'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, I didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too.

TIFU by almost kidnaping the wrong grandma,"TIFU by almost kidnaping the wrong grandma 



My mother's side of the family lives in Japan. Since I lived abroad ever since I was a child, I haven't met my grandmother in a long, long time (I am closer to my paternal grandmother). Anyways, my grandma has always been afraid of flying, so she hasn't traveled abroad in 10+ years, but this year, she decided to come visit us because her time is running out. She was supposed to come to the airport, and my mom was supposed to pick her up. 




However, some other important issues came up, and my mom had to travel to a different city for two days. So instead, I went to pick up my grandma from the airport. (Note that we can't communicate with one another directly because she doesn't speak English and I suck at Japanese.) I waited at the airport for 2 hours prior to her arrival time because I was nervous af. All I had was a recent photograph of her and her phone number in case I can't find her. People arrived, and I kept waiting for an old Asian lady with snow white hair to come out. I tried calling her phone number, but it seemed like she ran out of battery or intentionally turned it off. After all, she's not tech savvy and she barely manages to dial our phone number because she's very old—80's approaching 90. 



From the terminal, I saw an Asian lady come out; she had white hair and looked exactly like the lady in the photograph I'm holding. I assumed it's my grandma, so I approached her, and said welcome in my super broken Japanese. She responded very kindly and said something I can't understand; I told her in English that we'll talk more when mom's around to translate. I offered to take her luggage, and we walked out together. 




We got home, and I fixed my grandma some food, and showed her to my empty brother's room [sic: brother's empty room]. I assumed she must be tired so I left her to be. Roughly 3~4 hours later, my mom called me and asked why I haven't gone to pick up grandma. I asked her, ""wtf are you talking about because she's here with me,"" and I snapped a photo and sent it to mom. Then she told me that the lady isn't our nana. 



Apparently, my grandma had arrived at the airport, but didn't fill out the paperwork, so it took her extra 30 minutes to get out. She waited for me at the airport. She also didn't pack her charger in her luggage and her phone had run out of battery, so she asked other Japanese passengers to help her call her daughter (aka my mom) after she waited at the airport all alone FOR 3 HOURS. After talking to grandma, my mom called me in panic. 




Anyways, I went back to the airport to pick up my real grandma, and she gave me a hug. I came back and talked to my fake grandma by having my mom translate our conversation via phone call. She was just an old lady from Japan whose family signed her up for a spa getaway retreat after her husband passed away, and thought I was from the agency to pick her up. I asked which resort she booked, saw her itinerary papers, and drove her to the place she signed up for. Before she left, my real grandma, fake grandma, and I had a mini supper, and I apologized for causing major confusion. 




Before I dropped off my fake grandma at the resort, she tipped me.

[Fake grandma] (http://i.imgur.com/VlM4kgB.jpg) looks like this. Please don't say that I subjected her to a hostile environment for making her sit on the floor. She kept on sitting on the floor. She was so nice to me, never lost her cute smile, and tried to talk to me in Japanese, but I couldn't understand her. This is the one and only photo I have of her (which I sent to my mom); she was okay with me taking a photo of her, but if someone on reddit is her family member and want this photo taken down, send me a message and I'll do so upon verification that you're her relative. 

[Real grandma] (http://i.imgur.com/AFrn6Za.jpg) looks like this. This photo was taken by my mom at night. She probably loled at my failure. 


By the way, [this] (http://i.imgur.com/eRXfMXq.jpg) was the photo I had to *guide* me at the airport. This photo was literally the only photo my mom had of grandma from the last 5 years because she hated taking photos. Please note that it doesn't really show her face, so I was mostly looking for ""white hair + old + short Asian grandma"" at the airport. 



For those who need proof of the bill I received:

"If a women hits a man, he has every right to hit her back.","I don't agree with the saying that a ""man should never lay his hands on a woman"" and that women are the weaker gender as justification. A man is shamed for ""getting beaten up by a girl"" and for hitting a girl. I think this covertly sexist mentality normalizes violence against men and empowers abusive female partners. If a woman hits a man, he has every right to hit her back or take the high road if he prefers but should not feel obligated to do so. 

EDIT: I absolutely do not condone violence against anyone and I find the comments advocating for violence against women appalling to say the least. I'm just annoyed by the double standards when it comes to physical assault and fighting back. Also, I don't believe it's mainly due to the size difference as some people claim.

TIFU by laying an egg during sex,"I have posted this elsewhere, but I feel like you guys deserve to hear it.  It just happened a few weeks ago. 

Backstory; my bf and I have been experimenting with new sex toys lately. We bought some Tenga eggs b/c he has an issue with sensation. Some kind of mental block due to past traumas. I thought maybe they would help by increasing sensation and distracting his wandering mind.


We had tried the egg a few different ways, and I had looked up some porn vids to get ideas of different things. I saw one particular video showing a couple having PIV with the Tenga egg on the penis. I thought it might be a bit difficult to get it due to my small size (As a petite woman, I am petite everywhere) but figured we'd give it a go. 

After a bit of fumbling and slipping, with tons of lube, we finally get it in. It's staying at the base and doing just fine. He says it's a bit too tight, but we keep going in hopes that my muscles will let up a bit as they usually do.

He's getting a good rythym going and we hear a kind of popping/slurp sound. I think ""oh great, we just ripped it"". So we stop to inspect it. I looked at his dick and it wasn't there. I started feeling around in the sheets to see where this thing slipped to. Can't find it.

Suddenly we both looked at each other. The same thought crossed both of our minds. ""Is it...? Oh god."" 

I stick a finger inside myself to see if I can feel it, nothing. It must be way up there. I get up onto my knees, he's intently staring at me at this point, freaking out. I'm totally calm because, as a woman (who has used menstrual cups), I know anything that goes in can come out with enough effort. I start to bear down, and feel some pressure. 

Yep, it's definitely in there. I stick my finger in again and bear down. I feel the smooth side, but can't locate the hole. It had flipped onto it's side. I continue to bear down and attempt to turn it. I finally caught my finger on the rim and slowly pulled it out. When it came out it made a loud sluuuurp sound and flopped onto the bed. 

All while he was looking on in horror. I immediately started laughing my ass off. It took us about 10 minutes to collect ourselves. I tossed the egg into the sink so that we could wash it later. We then finished off where we started, sans Tenga egg.

Later when we were getting into the shower, he grabbed the egg and handed it to me. He said ""don't leave your child unattended""

We now refer to it as our child.

TLDR; Fucked up by getting a Tenga egg stuck in my vagina. Had to birth it out, but it went *okay*

In those 2 years we had ups and downs like in any relationship but to sum it up we always worked it out somehow and grew together more and more. 

Fast forward to yesterday: we had been talking about what we wished for our future and at some point he just went ""I think we should break up when we leave college"". 
I was shocked because in every other conversation he seemed like he wanted to continue our relationship. 

The problem is: I really don't want to break up with him. 
I love him so much and I don't see the point in being in a relationship with someone who wants to break up anyway. 


Am I at fault or does anyone else feel like it would be a waste of time?

"[IA] My father left my 3y/o daughter about $500k in a trust, ex-husband (who lives in MN) wants to use the trust funds for living expenses","My father left my daughter, who is 3, about $500k in a trust. The trustee is not a family member, but a professional trustee. My daughter is supposed to begin receiving the money at 25, but they explained that they have the power to dispense money early for the right circumstances, like a private school or medical bills - or, as they very loosely and briefly mentioned, basic living costs in an emergency hardship situation. They gave an example that if I were to become ill and unable to work, the trust could provide some level of assistance to ensure my daughter does has food on her plate and a roof over her head. However this was glossed over pretty quickly and I don't know the technical details.

About two months ago my ex husband quit his job because he said they are unwilling to be flexible with him for his debilitating migraines (his employer told me that he claims to have migraines but has never actually seen a doctor about them for treatment), and says he has been unable to find a new job and intends to instead pursue getting on disability, but expects that to take 2-3 years. He says that he will soon lose his apartment. He is unable to receive most government-based assistance because he scammed the system last year (lied about income to receive food assistance for which he was not qualified and got caught).

So, he has now approached the trustee and wants to use the trust money to pay for an apartment, utilities and a car until he is approved for disability. I was especially surprised about the car portion - he says he needs money to purchase a safer vehicle because his vehicle is old, rated poorly for crashes and does not have working seatbelts (which is a surprise to me - just a few weeks ago I buckled her into the back seat when he picked her up, so not sure what exactly he is claiming there).

I disagree with this use of the funds, particularly because he only has her for 6 days per month. I understood the ability to use the trust for living expenses should be limited to scenarios in which she is genuinely in danger of being homeless or neglected, and that is not the case as I provide everything she needs now and can do so all the time if he is unable to. My father intended the money to provide her with opportunities once she is old enough to use it wisely, not to facilitate my husband's visitation in our custody agreement.

Since my ex husband has a history of committing fraud when receiving government assistance and also a history of faking illness (he lied to a previous employer to receive paid time off work claiming he was being treated for cancer when he was not), I do not trust that his intentions here are genuine. I suspect he sees the trust as a way that he can get free money so that he doesn't have to get another job.

Anyhow, my question: since the trust is for the benefit of my daughter and she is obviously a minor, what can I do to ensure it is protected? Should I assume that the trustee has her interests in mind and will not prematurely release money for something like this, or does it sound like there is real danger that he will drain the trust? Is it possible for me to hire a lawyer to argue that the money should be saved for her later in life unless the circumstances are truly dire? I'm not sure if I can actually hire a lawyer and get them involved because I am not the trustee, the company is.

Thank you for any advice you can provide.",legaladvice

"(Md) I think my dead son's boss might have contributed to his death, but nobody will listen to me","My son was never a good kid, from very young he pushed boundaries with everyone and got really into drugs and alcohol. I'm saying this because it explains a lot.

He first started using heroin when he was 15. According to him he basically got addicted immediately. But when he was 19, after being kicked out of the house, arrested a couple times, he Came to us and finally asked for help. He eventually got clean and stayed clean for a little over a year, was starting to put together a life.

He got his first job at age 20. It was as a busser at a local restaurant. Though he was excited at first, eventually it became clear this was a toxic environment.

One of the owners, who I will call 'Sara' took a particular dislike to my son. She would call him and other busser with a similar backstory (1+ year sober addict) ""the junkies"" to their faces. She would steal shifts from my son because he didn't come in wearing the logoed shirt for the restaurant, but rather a very similar black polo without the logo (this was common practice for other employees, as they were only given one uniform shirt, and nobody seemed to have any issue with that). 

After four months of working there I wake up late one night to find him overdosing on our couch, and he dies. Mind you, he had been clean for a month over a year at this point, and seemed like he was happy with that, so I was in shock.

Anyway, as for my legal question, a month ago (around a month and a half after his death) a women who introduced herself as a manager/bartender at the place he had worked knocked on my door and said she wanted to show me a video. She explained that she had been worried about how 'Sara' treated son for a while, so on the day my son died when Sara started to pick a fight with him she secretly recorded it on her phone.

The video shows Sara drunkenly screaming at my son as he tries to do his job. She is telling him that he is a waste of time and space and should just fucking kill himself. Taunting him and asking him if he is back to sticking a needle into his arm yet so she can fire him. She even takes a swing at him.

Mind you, this is in the middle of dinner service and in front of customers. I strongly suspect this is what triggered his relapse (and what I suspect was more a suicide then a simple relapse). 

My question was if I had any legal recourse against the restaurant based on their treatment of my son. The other manager that gave me the video also said that she could probably find some people who witnessed other similar incidents. 

But the thing is that anyone I bring this up to in my small town just laughs and blows it off. When I brought it to the local lawyer his exact words were, ""Well he was a fucking junkie, you want to sue the only people who were stupid enough to hire him?"" I know that he was seriously mistreated, and worse then that from what the restaurant manager implied it sounds like the restaurant may be knowingly targeting heroin users and/or ex-users, using them for a few months until they either get tired of the bullshit or relapse, and then firing them for a new round of the same.",legaladvice

AITA for keeping my father's love child a secret?,"About 22 years ago my dad had an affair and got his mistress pregnant. He confessed all to my mom who responded ""take care of your responsibility but I never want to hear about this again."" So my dad did just that- he paid child support and had a relationship with my brother but spoke of it to no one except his attorney, his mother, and sister. He claims  a lapse in judgement and has been faithful and committed to my mom since.

5 years ago I ran into my aunt and Nana having lunch with a teenage boy. They seemed uneasy but asked if I wanted to join them and I really hit it off with Nicholas. He was cool as shit and we had a lot in common even though I was 22 and he was 16. I asked my Nana  how they knew him and she brushed me off. Later that day my dad asked me to meet up and told me that Nicky was my half brother and the whole story. All these years that we thought my dad was working, out of town on business or on a guy's trip he was usually with Nicky. At first I was really angry but then I felt really bad for him and Nicky and told him I wanted to have relationship with my brother. He said ok and seemed happy about it but asked that I not tell my siblings or let my mom know because it would devastate her. I played along for a few years. I was at Nicky's graduation, took him on his senior trip  backpacking in Europe, and helped him move into his college dorm. We're as close as if we grew up together.

I recently got engaged and in planning the wedding decided I wanted Nicky as a groomsmen with my other brothers. I told my dad and he agreed it was time to end the charade and my mom would have to face it. So he told my mom and my mom called me and begged me not to let the family secret out and how that was a hard time for her and she can't face my father's son. I felt bad but I think that my brother is also innocent in this and that my mom needs to be an adult and face reality. So we told my siblings. There have been a lot of emotions over the past few months but my siblings  love Nicky and he's really happy to have brothers and sisters and fits right in. My dad seems relieved to have all his kids together and not to be keeping a secret. My mom spent the entire summer at our beach house and still seems to be in denial.

Her sister (my aunt) says I'm an asshole bc I should've stayed out of it. 2 of my 4 siblings think I'm an asshole for keeping the secret for so long. They think its unfair that I got to make so many memories with Nicky and they didn't get to. One of them is around Nicky's age and is really bummed she didn't know she had a brother so closer to her age. I think they have lots of time to make memories with him now and that I was in a tough place and made a hard decision but that doesn't make me an asshole.

&#x200B;

Just a few edits to clarify some things:

1. My dad hasn't been going behind my mom's back to see Nicky. When I spoke to my mom, she indicated that she knew that my dad had a relationship with him and my dad said that he told her during the ""I don't want to hear about it talk"" that he told her that he couldn't just throw money at the child but not be involved and my mom said she knew he couldn't. While he never said ""I'm going to Nicky's soccer game tonight and won't be home for dinner"" my mom told me sister during a talk a couple months ago that she almost always knew when my dad was with Nicky. 
2. My wedding isn't until next year (next October) and if my mom still hasn't dealt with the situation and feels that she can be part of the day, then we will push it back a little more if we need to. My SO fully supports me in this. I wanted the secret to come out now so that we weren't dealing with it right before the wedding and Nicky wasn't being introduced as our brother at the wedding. That's a total asshole move and never occured to me to do 
3. There have been a lot of comments about me not loving my mom and being callous towards her. This was not my intention. I love my mom. She is wonderful and loving and I don't want to cause her any pain but I also do think that my parents made the wrong decision 22 years ago to keep Nicky a secret and that she's had 22 years to come to terms with his existence. No one sees her as someone to pity. If anything, everyone's respect for my dad has gone down a few notches for being unfaithful, however, my mom had/has a chance to act with grace and compassion and I think that is what most people will see: my dad is the louse and my mom is the saint for staying with him, forgiving him, and being tolerant of Nicky. 
4. I know I talked a lot about my dad being happy and some negative comments made about that. My dad is not overjoyed that my mom is hurting but he is relieved to not be living two lives anymore. Despite his infidelity, he is an upstanding guy and it bothered him to continue lying to his children and he hated sneaking around. 
5. Yes, my sister was 3 months old when my dad confessed the affair. The affair lasted about 6 months and began around a time when my parents were living apart and continued for a couple months after they reunited (they reunited right before my sister was born). Their separation had nothing to do with infidelity or lying.
6. My mother has not been alone at the beach house. My dad has been with her a lot of the time and each of us siblings has visited her. She's also had friends staying with her. 

Also, just because I don't want people to think that my parents have a bad marriage that my mom has suffered through all these years for us kids-they don't. They are loving and affectionate. My dad adores my mother and she adores him. She has told us that she stayed with my dad then because she loves him and that the affair was out of character for him and she didn't believe he would do it again. She does not want a divorce and everyone really is trying to help her through it as much as possible.",AmItheAsshole

I got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. I had to pick her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out, but I also told her I was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

I haven't told my wife about it, because I don't want to violate the deal I made with her. I want her to know that she can trust me. I just hope I'm making the right choice.",AmItheAsshole

"Matched with girl on tinder. Profile said 18, got phone number, she calls and reveals she's 10.","I blocked her and the texts were super short and completely non sexual. She randomly calls me and I was like shit she sounds super young. I text her and ask if she's 18. She said yes. Later she texts me and said she was lying. She FaceTimes me and she's in fucking kid pajamas and says she's 10 and calls me stupid. 

This is dangerous. What can I do to notify her parents ?  It is an ATT number. Should I call them? 



Edit : I looked up the number on social media. Nothing. I reported it to tinder using their online form. 

She used fake pictures of course. I could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. I will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. I reported it to tinder and that's all I will do. Some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. The second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) I hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. She revealed she was 10 while I was in the process of blocking the number. 

Even before she said she was under 18 I said absolutely zero things that wouldn't be okay to say to a ten year old, so I know I'm in the clear. I believe there's zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. ",NoStupidQuestions

I just told her, that I do not want to continue our relationship anymore. Big thank you for all your advice!

&#x200B;

Background info: Together for 13 years, 9 years married, two kids (6 and 1).

Prologue: Two years ago, my wife asked me to sell her old phone. I thought it would be good idea to save all the images of our kids before erasing it and accidently stumbled upon some explicit nudes of her in the ""sent"" folder of a messenger. I confronted her, she admitted sending them, but assured, it was only to one of her female friends. Although she did not want to disclose the recipient, I believed her and never brought it up again.

3 month ago, I found out my wife was cheating on me. I had to find out the hard way, by being alerted by suspicious behavior and putting small pieces of evidence together.

To fully understand my question, I have to go in detail here: We were always a very close couple, spent most of our time together and generally enjoyed each other company. We were not only lovers, but also best friends. When travelling, we sometimes spent several months together 24h/day without being uncomfortable.

A few month ago, my wife suddenly changed, saying that she needs timeouts from busy family life and wants to be alone. She told me, she would go for long walks or meet distant friends. I was completely fine with that at first. Suspicion began to raise slowly, as her stories became more and more implausible. I finally confronted her with some solid proofs of her lies and she confessed the affair a day later. She also admitted, that many of her ""timeouts"" were just an excuse to meet the other guy. My wife promised to end the affair immediately. I believed her and as I still love her, I decided, that I was willing to forgive her.

Since then we didn't really move forward. She agreed to marriage counseling, but stays distant, says that she wants to be alone, is unsure about her feelings for me and needs time to find out if she still wants to be with me. If I make a move towards her (e.g. ask her out for dinner) she mostly considers this as pressure. So, for the moment I have no other option than to stay calm and give her time.

I can handle the uncertain future fairly good, but I am struggling to trust her again. She still goes for long walks regularly and sometimes this triggers me quite hard. While she is away, I often feel miserable, thinking how she might be cheating again. I find myself seeking for proof of my suspicion, like I found the last time.

I know that trust cannot be build up by control and controlling behavior will not help her feelings for me to return, so mostly I don't tell her anymore, when I feel the urge to control her.

I talked to her about my bad feelings at first and suggested to turn on the location tracking feature of her phone during her walks. Just for a limited time, until I feel better. We had a long discussion about it, but in the end, she did not agree, as she doesn't want to be controlled and doesn't think it is helpful to regain trust.

My trust slightly improved over the last few weeks. We made some very small progress in our relationship and I am learning to deal with ""trigger moments"".

Until two days ago… I don't know what exactly was the cause, but I felt like seeing warning signals again that evening. She told me, that she was on the phone with a friend while she was away.

I didn't say anything that evening, but spoke to her the next day. I explained very calmly, that I felt uncomfortable that evening and that she could help me very much, if she would show me the call list of her phone to prove, that she was really on the phone with her friend.

She got very angry, telling me, she won't let me see it, as it would be an invasion into her privacy and I should work on my controlling behavior.

Am I right in thinking, that either she is lying to me again or not wanting to work on our relationship at all (in making a step towards me)?

Or is she right in saying that control should never be an option and there have to be other ways to reestablish trust?",relationship_advice

"I [M61] just found out my wife [F51] ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars.","UPDATE: a little long but this is where we are now

I want to thank all those that responded, it was a tremendous help. I wrote my post last night, couldn't sleep and didn't have any direction to proceed. Based on your feedback, all of her credit cards have been cut up. She has committed to paying the debt off, and has established some favorable job interviews on Monday, one related to teaching, another as sexual assault nurse examiner. After going through the finances again the total debt is 112,000. The interest is 19 to 20%, and she was only paying the minimum and not paying much on the principal. I have contacted my financial advisor and will meet with him on Tuesday, he understands the issue and we will pick the right option for consolidating the debt. She is losing authorization to our bank account and all of her spending will go through me. She is not on drugs or gambling, the money was spent mostly on clothes. After our son was born, she was a stay at home mom until he went to 1st grade. During this timeframe is when she started the spending. Her weight was up and she had very little to do, and her self esteem was low and she got credit cards in her name (only) and started buying. She thought she would pay debt off after getting a job, but the whole situation spiral out of control. I was traveling a lot for work and she was handling the finances. This was hidden until I discovered it last night. I feel we can recover financially but depends mostly on her. I was criticized for making her tell her parents what she did. We are in a small town in the deep south and family is important. My parents are not alive, and I needed her parents for support and getting her on the right path. She is an addict, and although this shamed her, she has to hit rock bottom and understand the damage she did to our family. This is the only way to recover. I met with her mother today and requested help in building her back up and not let her fall in depression or self pity. We are scheduled for couple counseling this Monday and hopefully we can start repairing trust in our relationship. Any additional input is greatly appreciated, but that's for all the input.



First time posting, need help on what I should do.  I [M61) just found out my wife [F51] ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars. I have just retired after 35 years of working as an Engineer and was unaware she was spending money out of control. Since retiring, I'm more involved with the budget and found these unexplained charges in our bank account. When confronted she only told me of 3 of the six that were lower debt totaling 20,000. I dug further into our finances and made her show me her accounts with monthly charges and found more, the total was 103,000. She broke down completely crying and begging me to forgive her. She is an RN but hasn't worked for about 6 years. We have one son that recently graduated from high school, now attending 1st year of college. She was extremely involved with his school activities and functions, volunteering many hours, appearing as the perfect mom to the community. Still don't know what she bought with all the money, but believe it was buying clothing and other junk for her and my son, but mostly her, over a 10 year period. I made about 160,000/year so don't understand how she spent the income and generated this extreme debt. My current retirement income cannot cover these credit debts and I'm not willing to tap into my son's college fund or 401k fund. She has committed to finding a job and paying off all the debt by herself, but I feel I have been completely betrayed and have loss my trust in her. I told her this is a game breaker for our marriage and now wondering if I should be seeing a lawyer. She says she loves me extremely and beg me not to leave and that she will fix this mistake herself and it's her problem not mine. I feel she means it, but might be more concerned about finding out. Based on her personality she would be extremely embarrassed if people found out what she did. I made her call her parents and tell them what's she had done. She respects them tremendously and has always been seen as the perfect mother that did no wrong. I still love her, and both of us, love our son and don't want to split up. Need help on what to do any insights or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

AITA for disabling the Wifi due to my friend's loud teenager?,"I own my own home and have a friend and his kid staying with me for a week - his school has a different schedule and he is off for these days.  To make a long story short, this kid (16 years old) is extremely loud and has been keeping me up at night with his gaming. 

 I can understand the occasional outburst, but his yelling and screaming will go on for hours on end during the night, and as a working professional, absolutely need my sleep to have a productive work day.

I have asked him (and his father, my friend) several times to please quiet down during the evening/night, but his screaming has persisted for the past two days.  My neighbors to the side of me (town home development) made a joke out of it last night, laughing at the fact that they have heard everything -- I was quite embarrassed.

 So this morning before leaving for work, I disabled the WiFi to my home - it just so happens the router is in my room which I locked.  I live in a residential area where the closest shopping center is about three miles away.  I felt a twinge of remorse as I got to work, but hopefully he'll learn a lesson.

TIFU by accidentally doing my black history month project on a white guy,"In 5th grade, I had a black history month project where I had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. I looked up 'important African Americans' and found a Wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so I thought. I chose Allan McLeod Cormack, a South-African American scientist, seeing that he invented the CT scan. I put my blood sweat and tears into that project. Two days before the project was due I decided to put a picture of Cormack on my poster. To my confusion, all I could find was a picture of this white guy. Turns out, he was a white South African. I made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. She let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but I had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month. 

TL;DR I did my black history project on a white guy and didn't realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.

TIFU by detoxing myself and it nearly cost me my life,"Obligatory this happened 2 weeks ago

&#x200B;

I had been dieseling through a handle of cheap vodka every other day for over a year. I've never been much of a drinker, but several traumatic events had transpired in a very short amount of time, so I began drinking more to help me cope. I would never consider drinking during the day or before work, but it helped me get through the day. Mixed drinks slowly gave way to straight shots of vodka. I would wake up at 7 am, feed the cat and take several shots. This continued well into the evening until I passed out on the couch or my bed. I started working at a local department store and the schedule was perfect as I didn't have to be in till1pm so I could wake up early, take several shots and sleep on the couch till noon then get ready for work; taking a couple of swigs on my way out the door. I'd get home around 10 pm and drink until I passed out.

This past February is when the shakes started, usually near the end of my shift. I'd get home, have a few shots and everything would be fine. What was disturbing was my memory loss. I was repeating stories, unsure of what day is was and I even forgot to pick up my nephew from school. Dusk and Dawn were the worst, it took me a few minutes to figure out if was day or night. I knew something had to change. Two Saturdays ago I bought a handle in the afternoon and it was gone by Sunday evening. I woke up Monday morning feeling awful. I was shaking, queasy and terribly off balance, but I didn't drink. By the afternoon I was feeling better and I figured I would get through this. I went to visit my sister and was having a glass of wine and a cigarette out on her back porch when I began to vomit all over her back deck. It was then that the shakes returned with a vengeance.

I went home and crashed on the couch. I woke up around 5 am and spent 20 minutes dry-heaving in the bathroom. I tried drinking water, but my hands were shaking so bad that it took both of them to steady the glass. I went back to the couch and drifted in and out of sleep for the majority of the morning. Sometime after noon, I went to get my cat some water, but my hand began to convulse uncontrollably. I tried to steady it with my other hand, but I spilled water everywhere; that was the last thing I remembered. I was laying on my stomach on the living room floor when I noticed a Police Officer standing over me. I had no idea where I was or what had happened. I tried to get to my feet but collapsed onto the couch. My coffee table had been completely turned upside down and its contents were strewn all about the room. My mouth was in so much pain and I saw chunks of blood on the floor where I had been laying. The Officer helped me get my shoes and coat on and assisted me out into the hall.

There were 2 more Officers waiting outside and the helped me down the stairs to an ambulance. The paramedics were asking me questions, but I couldn't answer their questions. once in the Emergency Room, the Doctors and Nurses bombarded me with questions that I could barely answer. My main concern was the throbbing inside my mouth. One of the nurses explained to me that I had chewed off part of my tongue as that was one of the effects of having a seizure. I was admitted later in the evening and that was my sister and nephew came to see me. I could tell by the look in her eyes I was in very bad shape.

I was hooked up to several different machines with IV tubes in both arms and a blood pressure cuff that sat snuggly on my left bicep that inflated every 15 minutes; I was on the brink of complete coronary failure. Over the next 3 days and nights I was a prisoner to my bed. There were sensors that would trigger an alarm if my legs went to far over the bed, if I tried to sit up it would set them off as well. If had to pee, they brought me a plastic jug and I had piss in the bed with an audience. Every 30 minutes the blood pressure guff would inflate and take a reading followed by a nurse coming in and injecting medicine into my IVs. The worst part was I couldn't eat and barely drink because of the pain in my tongue. My speech was incomprehensible as my tongue was so swollen. Everyday my sister came to visit and told me she had gone to my apartment to check on my cat and make sure everything was locked up; she even cleaned up the chunks of tongue off the floor.

By Friday afternoon I was stable enough to go home, but with strict limitations. No driving, no strenuous tasks and lots of medication. This past Friday I finally started eating solid food again; after 2 weeks of pureed food it was like heaven to eat a chicken salad sandwich. Everyday I get a little stronger and feel a lot better. I still have trouble with my memory, but I think its good that I don't remember too much about the last year. I spoke to my neighbor; the one who called 911. He told me he had heard me fall and came banging on my door. When I didn't answer he went around to my back door and saw me laying on the floor. He said I looked at him and my face was covered in blood, that was when he called 911. I gave him a hug and he checks in on me daily. My tongue will never heal, but it's a small price to pay to remind me never do that again.

TL;DR TIFU by attempting to detox, I suffered a seizure and chewed through my tongue. If my neighbor hadn't been home to hear me fall, I would've died.

AITA for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically I [M42] got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. My wife[F41] immediately supported her and made sure that I would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. It was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. I'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to Athena. 

The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life. My wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if I don't ""get my act together"". I personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

[Update] I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I talked to her.,"I would like to preface this post with an apology. I know it has been nearly three weeks since I last posted. To be honest, in no world did I ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. I've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. Not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original It, I have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. For that, I am sorry.

For the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. It is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

For the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a Greek tragedy, I apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

Now to start where things left off.

After making my original post, I combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a Plan B box and thrown it into the garbage. A lot of them made sense. My greatest hope was that it might have just been old. Maybe it was before we even met. Clinging to that, I hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. I'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what I would say in response, and what I would do. I memorized them all.

On the evening after I made my original post, I called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. As I had practiced, I asked her the following question:

>Hey, I'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? 

The second the words ""Plan B"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. She was completely lost for words. I already knew at that point. I retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>Why was there a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? You know I had a vasectomy. 

She just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. Then she looked to the floor. Then she started weakly sobbing. 

This was not on the flowchart. I had no idea how to respond. I thought if I let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. Finally I prompted her with another question:

>Are you crying because you did something you regret?

She shook her head violently. I was so concerned because I thought something horrendous might have happened.

She abruptly shrieked ""I'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" I have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

So I prompted her again. 

>Just tell me why it was there. You don't have to hide anything from me.

She yelled at me again. Repeatedly. ""If you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""Fuck you for not trusting me.""

This line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. I refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, I wasn't budging an inch. She then informed me that either I had to leave or she would leave. Since I doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), I agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. I went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

The following night, I texted her asking if she was ready to talk. She was not. Instead, she gave me an ultimatum: I had to [1] apologize, [2] promise to never bring it up again, and [3] learn to trust her completely. Only then would she allow me back home. If I couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

I have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. I am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. I currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. The lawyer will probably tell me I'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

There is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. I am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her.

"Rover.com dog sitter lost my dog, hindered his recovery and damaged my work contract in the process.","I hired a well reviewed [rover.com](https://rover.com) dog sitter to watch my dog on Fri in order for me to work on a contract out of the city. I dropped my dog off at the sitter's house at noon on Fri, and at 8:30pm he sends me a message letting me know that my dog had escaped. (something about his girlfriend and a open door) I break my work contract and race back to the city to start looking for him, and posted his info on several social media sources to get as much exposure as possible. I find out through Bunz and FB that my dog was sighted about a kilometer away at 6:30pm, so this guy waited several hours before letting me know that my dog was missing.

I get into the city and start looking on foot. He informs me that he has called the police and TAS (toronto animal services) and has ordered a set of missing posters to put up in the neighbourhood trough Rover. He then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. Great right? This is where things get unpleasant.

It's -10C outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider I realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. I call [rover.com](https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. I get a tip from Facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to TAS, but I needed to call them for a more accurate description. I call TAS when they open on Sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. At that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that I would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) This is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

I continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, I double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. I finally get a tip off to his location through Facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. This is after 17h straight of walking in -10C weather. I covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because I was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. I couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

I speak to [rover.com](https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. It turns out they were never collected from the Staples that printed them. So this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. I have them now as evidence.

&#x200B;

Emotions aside, is there any course of action I can take to deal with this person? By lying about the search, the posters and the TAS report he delayed valuable search tools that I could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. I also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

This guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. I'm at a loss for how to proceed. (If at all) 

Edit: to clarify I did eventually find my dog, he's safe but it was a hellish experience.

AITA for not telling my Uber passengers that I speak Chinese?,"I'm white, I took four semesters of Mandarin in college. I picked up my Uber passengers tonight, who were international Chinese students, which is not unusual, it's a relatively large college town.

I did my usual Uber driver routine: Ask a question or two to gauge willingness for conversation; if I get one word answers, and/or no followup reciprocating questions, I leave it alone. They gave off a major no interest in talking vibe, so I left it alone.

Cut to 3 minutes later, and they start talking about something which, for the sake of their privacy, I feel legitimately uncomfortable even sharing anonymously here. It was really fucked up heavy personal shit. I am not a fluent speaker, but good enough to follow 80% of a conversation, and I was getting very uncomfortable.

I guess the reason I ask is because I am 100% sure that if they had any idea I could understand them, they wouldn't have been talking about what they were talking about. It felt like I almost lying by omission? I could have interjected super briefly, in Chinese, to let them know I understood, but it felt like that would have been more awkward than just letting them believe I didn't understand.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by doing destroy dick December and actually destroying my dick.,"So this happened last night into this morning. If you dont know what destroy dick december is, its when you fap/ejaculate for every day of the month for that specific date. Anyway me being the fast ejaculator that I am, I actually took the challenge. I can make myself cum in under a minute the first time if i really want to and I normally do at least twice each ""session"". I am uncircumcised and could never get my skin back when i'm fully erect (will be relevant later)

I did no fap November so on the first day there was quite a load and a huge relief. Everything went alright until about the 6th day where It was becoming really difficult to get myself to cum. took too long even though that i spaced it out throughout the day. But no worries I had a genius plan to solve this. Make a masturbation machine for guys. You know you've seen those ones they make for the girls with a dildo strapped to a drill or something or the other. I had my idea i just needed to execute it.

On the 8th day (yesterday), I Decided to take what prisoners called a ""fifi"" and improve upon it. I took a 2 liter soda bottle, cut the top 1/4 of it off and bent the rim inwards (should have bent it outwards and taped over it instead but im getting ahead of myself). I bore a hole in the cap with a screw from the inside of the cap and duct taped over it not to prevent any leaks. I then took a rubber latex glove, making sure the fingers were inside and taped it over the end of the bottle I had just cut. I pulled a few of the fingers through the actual bottle opening (where you normally pour from). Then filled that baby up with some warm water and screwed it back up. I was proud of my contraption.

It was time to put her to the test. I took a drill and placed the screw in the part where you would normally put a drill bit, squirted some lotion in the glove, stuck my Johnson in there and gave her a test run.It worked like a dream. I didnt have to wear my arm out spanking it anymore, I could even adjust the speed to make me cum faster. After the first session I thought I could make it better by having it fully automated instead of having to hold the trigger down. Later that night when I was going for my 5th try. I got a zip tie and strapped it to the trigger and went to town. 

This try was pretty close to the last try since I woke up late that morning and had to start later. When I came i convulsed and lost all control while in orgasm, the drill still going at high speed had torn through the glove and the plastic end came in contact with my dick and sliced it right open. I was in a state of pain and pleasure.. I made a loud scream and my roommate came barging in to check on me. I dont remember the look on his face because I was in so much pain but i do remember him going ""what the fuck"" and pointing at my dick. I was bleeding badly and I can see part of my foreskin just hanging off of my penis. I was freaking the fuck out. Roommate said i needed to go to the hospital but i was reluctant considering the situation. after i while i said fuck it and he drove me to the hospital.

When they finally saw me, the nurses cleaned me up and the doctors were debating over something or the other. After a few minutes they came back to me saying that because so much of my foreskin had been cut off (the right half had actually been clean cut off, probably still somewhere in my room). They thought it was best to just circumcise me and take off the rest. Now a man in pain hearing that his dick will be cut off was just too much. i was flipping balls. Since this post is kind of long already I'll spare all the fine details. They ended up convincing me to get the circumcision, procedure was rather short. Came home with less of my dick that i had left with. Had to clean up my blood bath and threw away my invention. Dont  pull a MacGyver like i did, old fashion way works and stick with it.

TL;DR Made a masturbating machine that ended up slicing my dick and had to get circumcised.

Edit: changed ""no fap December"" to ""November"". glad i decided to make a throwaway for this lol. No i didnt think I was going to make it all the way to day 31, I just wanted to see how far I can get. Was hoping to make something out of it. No more fapping for me for a while anyway :/",tifu

Thanks everyone for your support. I actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. I didn't know she'd be there. She said hi to me like nothing was the matter. Like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. She looked great and I wish I hadn't gone to the party. I was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. But seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

After the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. She said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when I was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. Just like that. She said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). She said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

I said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. She apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. She said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

I just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. So she just decided pretending I didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

I can't say hearing all this helps. I don't really even have much closure. But people wanted me to update and so I did.

Thanks for all your help guys. Wish it was more interesting than it really was.",relationship_advice

TIFU by stabbing my husband while we were both horny,"Hey all,

Happened 2 Fridays ago not today but you know, formatting rules.

So my (F27) husband (M29) is a stay-at-home dad while I am a working wife. Every morning, before I leave for work, my husband polishes my shoes.

Since he has a submissive fetish, and I get some kinky pleasure out of this as well, what usually happens is that I would stand two steps up from the ground floor while my husband would kiss my feet and suck my toes. He would put my socks and shoes on, and then polish my shoes while I am wearing them, Then, he would prostrate at the bottom of the steps while I would literally (albeit lightly) step on his head out the door.

&#x200B;

That, I had an event to get after work so I decided to spice things up and wear some high heels to work. In fact, I got them kind of sharpened as I was trying to imitate Esme Squalor (couldn't literally use knifes as heels as that wouldn't be practical).

So anyway, my husband kissed my feet, sucked my toes, put on my heels and started polishing them. He prostrated as usual, and not wanting to place my heels on his head, I thought I would aim for his shoulder blade. Unfortunately I missed and ending up stabbing the back of his neck

He started bleeding so I called 911 and he was taken to the ER. I told the doctors that we were having a fight in which I stabbed him with my heel.

So they called the police and I was arrested for domestic abuse until my husband was discharged from the hospital and able to convince the officers what really happened. He was extremely embarrassed to do so, and the police kept telling him that men can be abused as well, etc... Neither my husband or I have ever been this publicly embarrassed. I'm just glad that I wasn't literally using knives for heals

My Dad is hitting my mom and I don't know what to do,"My dad has had a history of hitting my mom since I was young, not often, but it happens when he gets angry or depressed. Regardless, I'm old enough now (16F) where I actually understand what's going on but I don't know how to go about fixing it. I know I should call the police, but I'm afraid of what will happen if I do. My mom is very sick, she has been for years, she has narcolepsy and other issues that prevent her from working, driving or leaving the house 99% of the time. My dad is our only source of income and I'm afraid that if he goes to jail then my mom won't get the medical care she needs. I have been living at my grandmother's house because my dad has physically abused me enough to the point where I couldn't stand staying there anymore (threw a laptop at my face which split my lip to the point where I should have gotten stitches, have pictures of the injury and still have a scar for proof, punched me in the stomach, slapped me so hard my nose bled, etc), so I don't know what I can do to help from here. My sister is still at home with my mom but my dad doesn't touch her so my grandma and I have tried to convince my mom to come here but she is too afraid to leave my sister alone with him, plus we have a dog and a cat she is worried about them being taken care of, but that isn't the worst of our problems right now. It feels wrong to leave my sister with him but I need to get my mom out of there before he really hurts her or worse, he has multiple guns in the house. Because of his mental health problems I have no idea if one day he just snaps and does something insane. However my grandma is retired and living off social security so this isn't a permeant solution. Basically asking for advice on what I can do without risking my mom's safety/healthcare. My dad has been very good at keeping his abusive behaviors hidden from his side of the family so I am also afraid of what will happen if he goes to jail. If we need a lawyer I don't even know how we would be able to afford one because according to mom my dad has all the money and all the credit cards are in his name. Sorry if I'm rambling it's late and I'm angry and upset about this situation. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

TX - Update. I informed the father of his possible two kids who are married to each other.,"Met up with him after work and got right down to it. I informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that I have a very good idea of who it was. 

He did not take the news well when I told him his son in law was probably his son. Lots of screaming. Lots of blaming me. Eventually lots of apologizing to me. I told him I would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. I told him to get a dna test done and that I would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a DNA test being done first to prove it. He agreed this was a good idea. His thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. I told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

I told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a DNA test proving parentage. 

He agreed without any hesitation. 

So now its a waiting game. The lab I use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. The dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. I did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

[update] My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/)

Hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure I owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. Plus I've had some time to calm down. I probably wont reply to comments because otherwise I'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

If you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... And your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. It's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

Wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while I was at work. This was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. I dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting her to say, but I genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. Because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

When I get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. Not an apology. An ultimatum that if I went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering I owned the house before marrying her...)

I asked her if she was serious. If she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. Yeah, okay. At this point I remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. I asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. I kept pushing her and she kept saying no. Finally I told her that I had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  I explain that if I find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, I'm divorcing her immediately. She immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""Only"". Fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

Anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. Her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). I tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. She wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. I mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but Jesus Christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

I feel like I don't even know my wife. The woman I thought I married had some fucking empathy.

She still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. I explained she no longer has a say in the matter. Had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, I would have listened to them and taken them seriously. But by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

I told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or I would call a divorce lawyer. I also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether I meet with this girl, but I would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

A few hours later she ""apologised"". I say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. But whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. So we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

Tbh though, I don't think I'll ever see her the same way again. So I have doubts our marriage will last.",relationship_advice

Well Bruce and I's lease was up Dec. 31st. Beth and I started looking for places to finally call our own. We found pretty much the perfect place. 

This is where things start to falter a little. A few days around Thanksgiving I've noticed her texting non-stop all day long. Which isn't necessarily out of the ordinary since she has several group chats with her friends up here and back home. The part that really stood out to me was the she was laying next to me texting a number that wasn't saved in her phone, at 1:30 in the morning. I ask who she is talking to and she says her friends and Mike. I'm curious as to who Mike is because it's not one of the friends she normally mentions and she says she works with him.

Fast forward a few days and I have to get up early to open my store. I go to swap the phone charger from my phone to hers and when I do, her backlight lights up and shows a message from this unsaved number saying ""Hey beautiful, I just got home.."" this definitely peaks my curiosity.

I'm off the next day and she works early in the morning, so I stayed up and drank while she went to bed early. About 3am my drunken curiosity gets the better of me and I go grab her phone and head to the bathroom. She had basically been lying for a couple of weeks about them hanging out and cuddling and saying that she felt more chemistry with him than anyone else.

I was taken back and I was hurt. I waiting another couple days and did it again. This time Beth was talking shit on my roommate Bruce. She was making plans to go to ""zoo lights"" for a date with Mike and his friends. She was telling him how she would have left earlier in the year but didn't want to screw me on the lease. She was just going to suffer through being with me for a few more months and basically set it up for this guy to ""wait"" while they discussed when they could hang out around my work schedule.

Her and I were still planning on getting that place too. We had signed the lease, paid the deposit, and we were just waiting to take control of the property. The next morning after reading through her messages. I went down to the apartments we we're going to get and I asked them to cancel our contract. Since we hadn't taken possession of the property they were able to cancel it and keep the holding fees we paid. In order to cancel it, they needed both parties to confirm the cancellation. So they had to call her and ask if that's what she really wanted to do. I ran into an issue here of ""how do I cancel this without letting her know that I know she is cheating?""

So I lied. I called and told her I found a place for 3/4 the price and was closer to my job and would save us a ton of money in the next few months. She said it sounded like a good idea and I convinced her to agree to cancel the new lease when they called her.

I had to wait because my boss throws a spectacular Christmas party every year and he had already purchased everything for her to be my +1. This party was on a Sunday and I almost ruined everything by being impatient. The Saturday before the party she went out with friends (which I've never had a problem with) and then she decided to ghost me for the night. Which she knew would piss me off and was well in her intentions. So instead of confronting her then, I went to Mike's house (his address was in the messages they sent back and forth) and I put the ""Love Book"" I made her for Christmas last year into his mailbox. I then drove to my job and slept on the floor of the office. Bruce sent me a message at 4am saying she had just gotten home.

My plan here wasn't for him to find it until he checked the mail on Monday, my plan didn't work out. My assumption is that a neighbor saw me put it in the mailbox and gave him a heads up. (Because who checks the mail on Sunday) But Beth texted me that Sunday morning after a little bit asking why I would go to Mike's and give him her book. I know that she knows at this point and basically ask her what possible reason I could have for doing such a thing. Her response was basically ""well what do you want to do about it?"" And I told her let's make it through the night, have fun at the party, and we would discuss everything the next day. 

We had fun at the party, went to a comedy show, followed by dinner at a nice restaurant. Everything went fine, my coworkers knew but we're on their best behaviors about it. She could tell something was up, she messaged one of her friends saying that she thinks everyone knows and is judging her. They did know and they were judging her.

We go home and she goes to bed because she has to be up early for work and I set the rest of my plan in motion. I slept in the recliner and after she left for work that morning I drove down and picked up the Uhaul I had set up for us to move into our new place and I loaded up all of my big stuff and took it to storage. She came home, realized what I had done, look her cat and left to a friend's house.

Beth basically says she will be back in the next few days to get her stuff. So the weekend before Christmas comes around and she is waiting until that Sunday while I'm at work to get the rest of her stuff. I tell her to hang out at the house because we need to talk and figure it all out. So she is there Sunday and is doing laundry waiting for me to get off work. 

I come in and I just start helping her fold laundry. I ask if her cat is enjoying her friends house. Just small talk. After folding laundry we go to the living room where I set up my smaller than because I'm still in the house for a few days and want to play games. As I'm rummaging through wires, I tell her that I'm glad she has a place to go and will be taken care of. She says she is glad for the same thing for me. I scoffed and told her I was basically homeless because of this whole situation and she asks about the other apartment. I just tell her I lied, there was no apartment, it was the only way to get her to cancel the lease we were going to have. She sits in silence for a moment then goes to the bedroom and starts crying. I wait a few minutes and hear the dryer finish. Her last load of laundry is done. I grab it and help her fold it and put it in some boxes. I help her out with her stuff. She comes in to make sure she has everything and as she leaves I tell her to drive safe and shut the door behind her.

Now the second phase of my plan was the scrapbook that she had made me that was full of our pictures and concert memorabilia. I was going to wrap it and drop it off at Mike's on Christmas with the note that says ""if she cheats on me, she'll cheat on you."" BUT clarity hit me and before she could pull out and leave I ran out with the scrapbook I had hidden away and knocked on her car window. She rolled it down and I place the scrapbook in on her seat. She said that she made that for me, I can keep it. I just looked at her and said, ""I was going to give it to Mike, but I've already been enough of an asshole. They are your memories, you keep them."" and I went back inside.

I spent the last week of December working and using what spare time I had to move the rest of my stuff to storage and clean the apartment before the lease was up.
I'm currently on a friend's couch, but have found an apartment in her complex that the landlord said I could have on the 15th.

Beth and I are done. I love her but I can't trust her. I watched her lie to my face for about a month. She knew what she was doing and didn't feel guilty about it until she was caught. I'm just going to move on. Take some time to make myself a better person. Lose all of the weight I gained while her and I were together. Get active again. Find hope again.

Thank you to all of the Redditors who gave sound advice and an even bigger thanks to those who wanted to help me be petty. You guys really cheered me up with your gift suggestions and got me through a tough time with the laughs. ",relationship_advice

Update- My coworker adopted a kid from the Ukraine a couple of years ago. Now she's going around work asking us to adopt him and writing about giving him away on Facebook.,"Let me start with saying a huge thank you to everyone in this subreddit that replied to my post. Now that the dust has settled a bit, I'm honestly kinda overwhelmed by the number of people that went to huge lengths to tell me about just how serious this situation was/is, deep dived on resources, ect. I got PM's from people that worked for local and state governments and private agencies that were outside of my state but offered their contacts. I had people that spoke Russian/Ukrainian offering to help contact the Ukrainan Embassy and offered me contact information for Embassy departments. People even contacted us offering money for Tony's immediate needs in the event we decided to take him in. I'm sincerely touched by the genuine concern all of you had for Tony and his siblings and I hope one day I can tell Tony that despite everything that's happened, there's people out there like you guys that care about him. The information you guys gave us helped us act fast and got the ball rolling on this situation faster than me and my boyfriend would've figured out alone.

I talked with the cops about the situation and honestly? They were just as confused as I was. The person I talked to on the phone was just as stumped but he agreed that at a minimum they did need to do a welfare check. I've had experiences with welfare checks before and I had the nagging feeling that something just wouldn't go right…and someone PM'd me the priority line for my state's child protective services hotline. I got someone on the phone right away, and as soon as I mentioned that trafficking could be going on and that she was advertising the kid on Facebook (it was a public post here too, people), they acted with a quickness. I gave them all the information I had on Mary and Tony and all the information I had from Mary about Tony's adoption. The person I spoke to right away said that she suspected that the adoption MIGHT NOT EVEN BE LEGAL. I was floored. I e-mailed all the screenshots I had to the person I spoke with and asked for a followup if that was at all possible. I said that myself and my boyfriend were willing to take Tony on a temporary basis if necessary, but the CPS representative said that likely wasn't possible. Then, the waiting game began. Last night was probably the most stressful night I've ever had- hell at one point, I was ready to drive out to Mary's house myself but was stopped by my boyfriend. It was tough.

The cops followed up with us at approximately 2:00AM. Note that I haven't heard from CPS. The officer I spoke with was very cautious and limited in what he said, but he told me that CPS arrived at the home shortly after he did. In not so many words, he implied that Mary had been talking to someone about meeting Tony the very next day and that CPS' suspicions were confirmed— Tony's adoption was not legal. Tony was rehomed to Mary and her husband from another state where placement needs to be approved by a judge. He didn't elaborate further except to say that other issues came to light and all of the children were removed from the home for their own safety by CPS. He didn't say how long they were there, but said it was ""a long time"". I was asked to drop off all e-mails and printouts to the station in the morning, and I agreed.

My boyfriend and I wanted to make doubly sure that all of our bases were checked, so I called our local FBI office who said they lacked jurisdiction in the matter but would be writing up a complaint and referring the issue to the State Department. We called the Ukrainian Embassy and made a detailed complaint and I included the contact information I had for the officer from the department.

The shit really hit the fan when I went into work to printout the e-mail. Our company is pretty small and the company owner, (I'll call her Big Ange because of her resemblance to the Mob Wives lady) had gotten wind of Mary's email. Big Ange was FURIOUS, and waiting at Mary's desk to see if she would show up for work. My friend reported that Big Ange waited from 7:15 - 9:30 AM, and that Mary CAME TO WORK WITH A SOB STORY ABOUT HOW HER KIDS WERE BEING UNFAIRLY TAKEN AWAY! Mary wanted time off from work to ""clear her name"" and ""devote herself to re-claiming her family from this misunderstanding"". I wasn't there to witness this, but Big Ange, who has six kids herself, apparently ripped Mary a new asshole. Mary has been dismissed and rumor has it that Big Ange may or may not allow her to claim unemployment.

My head is honestly still spinning from everything that has happened. The past 24 hours have been insanity. I'm so grateful that the system worked as quickly as it did. I only hope it works out a long term solution to this problem and that Mary doesn't get to reclaim her kids. My heart is breaking for Tony and the other kids right now…I don't know what the fuck was happening in Mary's house that made CPS remove them that night, but I'm going to sleep better knowing that they aren't with psycho ass Mary and her husband, at least for awhile. What the future holds for Tony and the other kids (especially because Tony's adoption was apparently illegal) makes me sick…but I'm going to wish for the best.

I need a damn drink.

tl;dr: CPS took the kids. They're safe. Mary has been fired from work. Redditors amaze me with their kindness and willingness to help in times of crisis.",legaladvice
AITA For being upset at my parents even though they paid for my wedding?,"So, I'm ready to get roasted here but I will accept my judgment. I got married about 6 months ago, and my family offered to pay for most of the wedding. This was a HUGELY generous offer and I appreciated it a lot. I work in public service and there's no way I could have afforded a wedding at all. While I knew that by accepting the money, I really needed to let my family have the final word on a lot of decisions, I had one hold-out request that blew up into a huge fight. 

My parents have a neighbor, let's call him Charlie, who is just complete trash and NOTHING like any of their other friends.  I have nothing to do with him, and if he shows up at their place, I leave. He's racist, he's bigoted, he's exposed himself to women at parties as a ""joke,"" he's grabbed women while drunk, and he's a terrible alcoholic. Inexplicably, this guy is Teflon with my parents' friend group and according to them it would have been unthinkable to snub him. 

Now, we fought about this - an ugly fight. Tears were shed. I begged. My dad (he's mean) called me the ""c-word"" (and more) and threatened not to come to my wedding at all. He left me sobbing on the street and told me I was killing my mother because I am such an ungrateful bitch.

I am ... not proud of this but I caved. I was feeling vulnerable. I didn't want all the ugliness, my dad is seriously ill so every fight feels like I can't take it back, and my mom promised that Charlie would be escorted out at the first sign of trouble. I wasn't so sure, particularly because my group of friends is VERY diverse and my husband isn't white, but I trusted her that it would be okay for a few hours and I, according to her, ""wouldn't even know he's there.""

Fast forward to the wedding. Charlie gets rip roaring drunk and starts trying to fight our DJ. He's screaming ""fuck you,"" flipping him off, he's mad I guess because he doesn't like the music? The bartenders cut him off and he's escorted out. I didn't know this at the time because it was all handled so quickly. When I found out, I called the DJ and bartenders personally to apologize, but I'm livid. I'm so embarrassed. I know how easily this could have been worse, it could have just as easily been my husband's family, and I don't know that I would have ever been able to apologize enough. 

I am so angry at my parents for bullying me to invite Charlie, especially because he did exactly what I knew he would do and they act like no one saw this coming. AITA because I could have and should have walked away from their offer to pay and sidestepped the issue? Or is it fair of me to be upset because they used a generous offer coupled with a threat to blow up my family and estrange themselves to manipulate me to do something that made me horribly uncomfortable and it caused potentially disastrous consequences?",AmItheAsshole
My(37m) wife(39f) just told me that she initially faked love when we were dating me only for the money and admitted to cheating on me. But she claims that she fell in love with me after we got married. I need some advice here.,"My wife and I have been married for 8 years and we dated for a long time before that. I own my family business ( fashion and jewellery ). We have 2 daughters.

First off, I'll be honest with you guys. I'm not an attractive person. I look average at best. I don't have a chiselled body, but I'm fit. My wife is really beautiful and I always wondered what she saw in me. I was bald at 19, so I hope you guys get the picture.

When I was in my twenties, I was very awkward and introverted. I didn't date many girls, because no one was interested in me. I met my wife in college. We had similar interests and I fell in love with her. I asked her out and she said yes. I was on cloud nine. And we never looked back. 

Yesterday was our anniversary. We had a small celebratiion. When we were about to sleep, my wife started crying. I was really worried because I did not understand why. She hugged me and told me that she wanted to confess something. She ended up telling me that she faked her love for me when we were dating. She also told me that she cheated on me when we were dating. But she fell in love with me a couple of years after we got married. She told me that she really matured at that time and realised that I was the mist important person in her life. She also claims that she never cheated on me once we got married. She told me because she really felt guilty. She told me that she would do everything to make it up. 

I was really devastated. I always kind of wondered what she saw in me. And I think I have my answer now. I'm broken. I also know that I only know this because she confessed. I don't know what to do and I need help moving past this. Can you guys help me with some advice?

Edit: Thank you guys. I have decided that I'll do a paternity test and make my decision based on the outcome.

Edit2: Also, I've asked her to move out till the paternity tests are out.

Edit3: Though she fell in love with me now, I think I've fallen out of love now. I think I'm done with this relationship. Thank you guys. I gotta work, so I won't be replying anymore. Once again, thank you for listening to me.",relationship_advice

TIFU by knocking out my date,"So yesterday was Valentine's day and I've been seeing a girl who used to wrestle when she was younger. I was a wrestler for 10 years and we both knew this. So we get drunk last night and start messing around on the couch. We're just using moves on each other and I'm winning. 

We do this for a while and it's all fun and games until she says ""I bet I can beat you from the standing position."" We are both pretty trashed at this point so we stand up in her living room and start facing off. We tie up with each other and instinct kicks in so I sprawl and slam her head into the hardwood floor. I spin around behind her and then I realize she isn't moving.

At this point I realize that I fucked up badly. She comes to and she has a huge black and blue knot over her eye brow. I'm feeling like a gigantic piece of shit and after a couple of seconds she laughs and says it's okay. 

So the TL;DR here is that I got trashed on wine with a girl. We wrestled. I knocked her TF out on a hardwood floor. Now she has a lump like a pachycephalosaurus on her head.

Usain Bolt is so fast because he runs with a boner,"Now I'm no scientist but I've always wondered why he's so fast and after studying his races for 6 weeks I've come to the conclusion that its because he runs with a boner and here's why. So aerodynamically speaking a boner cuts through the wind resistance better than a flabby dick a flabby dick acts almost like a parachute adding wind resistance to the runner thus slowing him down. But Usain runs with boner thus acting like a spear cutting through the wind making the wind have the smallest affect on him. Where as his opponents flabby dicks slow them down. I do believe he uses performance enhancing drugs (viagra) to get and keep these race winning boners. Thank you for taking the time to read my research paper

TIFU by fulfilling a cuckolds fantasy,"Obligatory this is a throwaway and this happened last winter yada yada yada.

&#x200B;

I had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but I still swiped out of boredom. They were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. Couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. Only boob. There was no picture of her husband. I take a few shots and message them.  After like an hour of talking, I decide to just do it. We never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. She wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. At first I was like really not for it, I originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and I was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. At 2AM I left the house, and this is where I regret everything.

&#x200B;

After driving for about an hour, I miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped TWO of my tires. I'm in a shitty ghetto town that I've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how I'm getting home now. I thought I was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. But since there was no turning back now, I decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

The husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as I see him, my gut and inner voice are SCREAMING at me, don't do this, turn back. And I wish I had listened. For reasons unknown, I followed him into the house. It was pitch black, not a single light was on. He lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. I was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. If there was ever a time I disassociated, it was then and there. It was no longer me behind the wheel. The dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. Does anybody remember the scene in Blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? That was what I saw. A disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. I was horrified but at the same time, I didn't care. They both fucking STINK, that was one of the worst things. The smell took forever to wash off my hands after. Months later I'll get a whiff out of nowhere. That disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

I take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking THE ENTIRE TIME, like fucking Gollum. Saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. Look at that beautiful pussy. Ain't she so fuckin wet?"" Nonstop. Meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. Like I said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, I managed to perform to a degree but I never did finish. It probably didn't help I was wearing a condom but I'm extremely glad I was. The entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""How the fuck am I getting home? This smell is going to kill me. How do I end this? How do I get out of here?""

I decided it was time, I had to get the fuck out of there asap. I told them I couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. They insisted I put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. I just wanted to make it look like I at least tried. If the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. I pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. I stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. I politely reiterated I wasn't going to be able to finish. I blamed it on my tires being popped and I was too tired. They were cool about it, and I quickly gathered my things and left.

I BARELY had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. So we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. My hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers I took and how many times I washed them. I blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what I did. It took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. Easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of Shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

[UPDATE #2] I think my 12yo daughter is being groomed online (WA State),"Just a brief update because I really don't know very much.

I spoke to a local detective who works only on child exploitation cases.  The Canadian authorities have arrested the man who was communicating with my daughter.  I just found this out last week.  

Other than that, I don't know much else.

[Update] [ME / CA] My teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.,"Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.

Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)

The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.",legaladvice

WIBTA if I tell my girlfriend she needs to bring her own food to my house and pay for the food she has eaten?,"I want to start off by saying I love my girlfriend and I'm scared that if I give her this rule or expectation it will make her feel unwelcome at my home. We have been dating for awhile now and she's always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn't eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn't have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn't eat much since she's smaller but I didn't take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can't comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me's so often though since she's here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don't take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she's always making sure I'm taken care of and comfortable. I don't know if I should just suck it up because she's not taking much from me and if I'd be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?

A gambler dies and goes to Heaven...,"A professional gambler wins big and dies of an aneurysm. When he gets to the afterlife, he finds himself at the back of a miles-long line to get into Heaven.

Drawing on his experience, the gambler immediately thinks of a way to get ahead of everyone else. He taps the old man ahead of him on the shoulder...

""Want to make a bet while we wait?"" The Gambler asks. ""If I can guess your last words in three tries, you have to let me cut ahead of you.""

The old man, having nothing better to do, agrees. Immediately, the gambler begins ""reading"" him like the pro player he is. He notices the elderly Asian man's shirt is open, exposing a pair of defibrillator marks.

""Don't be silly, it's just indigestion."" the gambler remarks. The old man looks a bit surprised, then steps aside, giving up his place in line.

Next, the gambler taps on a redneck's shoulder. He makes the same bet, and the redneck also accepts.

""This one's easy!"" the gambler smirks, sizing up the bruised, bloody, grass stained redneck with the caved in skull. ""Hold my beer!""

Muttering profanities, the redneck begrudgingly steps aside and gives up his place in line.

Riding the high of a hot streak, the gambler wastes no time tapping the next man ahead of him on the shoulder. He quickly makes the same bet, and is ecstatic when the agreement is made.

""Okay, let's see..."" The gambler studies the new mark carefully. He's a large, imposing black man riddled with several bullet holes.

The gambler holds his hand out like a gun. ""You ain't taking me alive!""

The man shakes his head. Wrong. The gambler strokes his chin. The guy is giving him nothing else to work with.

The gambler holds the 'gun' sideways, makes a mean face, and shouts, ""Fuck the police!""

"Cops left me stranded in the desert, no money and no phone, two day trek home. Legal?","I'll stick to just the facts to make this as quick as possible since it's an ordeal...

Fell asleep in my parked car after working Uber for 48hrs straight in Southern California. Officer wakes me up. Points out my expired tags. She says it smells like I've been drinking. I dont drink. She runs my ID, finds an old warrant for misdemeanor possession from 8 years ago. Asks me to step out of the car. I do. When I go to reach for my phone on the mount, she says not to go reaching for things and stand over on the sidewalk. She immediately starts searching car while I sit over on the sidewalk. She finds 1/8th of mushrooms in my old bag in the trunk, from a year ago, I had forgot about em. She puts me in cuffs. I ask if my car is being impounded. She says yes. I ask for my cell phone and debit card, she says she will get them. I also ask if I can put on my shoes (as I was wearing old moccasins with barely any sole) and she laughs at me and puts me in her car. I can't see much else happening now. When she gets in the car I ask her again if she got my stuff and she angrily tells me yes and says something to the effect of I'm annoying her, so I dont question it further. 

I'm taken to the station, then transported to the county lockup 40 miles away. When I get there, they dump out the brown paper bag of my stuff that the officer had filled, and my phone and cards aren't in there of course. I ask the transport officer what happened to phone and money (cards), and he says he has no idea.  

8hrs later when I am released, I am stuck 40 miles away from my car with my phone and money in it. It takes me nearly two full days to get back to my phone, thru some very remote areas, where it is 120+ degrees. I spent the night on a bench outside a casino. I had no water, nor money for any, knew no phone numbers off the top of my head, no cab would take me to my car without payment upfront, hours of begging for a ride all failed. I badly burned and cut my feet on the searing concrete and broken glass on the side of the road. At one point I flagged down a sheriff and he laughed and told me he wasn't a taxi and left me. I fainted twice. The first resulted in tribal police waking me and asking me to move on, and when I only made it slightly further, the person who helped me ended up giving me a ride the rest of the way. When I finally get to my car I get my phone, but my card is missing... still is, which still makes things a pain in the ass. Just for the heck of it I went and checked around where my car was parked yesterday, and I found one of my cards (a postmates card) in the street there, so they were obviously dropped by the officer and ignored. 

Additionally, this cost me a extra two days in storage as my car was impounded, and I was starting a new job Monday morning, yet still did not have my phone and obviously did not make the shift, and so no more job. All for an 1/8th of mushrooms, which I take full responsibility for, along with the expired tags, but I've had several people tell me that denying my my phone and shoes like that was illegal. I have no idea at all. I'm still too exhausted to really process everything. I can say for certain that was the worst two days of my 34 years worth, and I can't think of a worse way to follow up my first arrest/first time in jail that 48hrs in the desert with no belongings. 

Any info, even if it's ""nope they can do that"", would be appreciated. Thanks guys. ",legaladvice
TIFU by uploading my old exams on the internet.,"So this all happened in June, and I'm only writing about it now because the situation just got solved.

As the broke college student I am I found a website that offered me money for my notes about classes and old exams that I have taken, extremely simply procedure that consists of simply uploading PDFs on the web, categorizing them, and then getting a payment on my paypal. I think ""Great! I make money and I can help kids seeing what to expect on the exam by seeing the old ones"". 

The fact that I scanned all my exams and kept them in my Google Drive to have them as possible study material made the whole process easier. I upload 5 documents from my Organic Chemistry class and get paid $25, I figure that I might as well do it for all the classes, more money to buy alcohol you know?

In the span of a couple days I upload about 120 documents for subjects such as OChem, Physics, Calculus that span from old exams to notes to summaries about the whole class, pretty much my old study materials. I get a couple hundred bucks and go buy my, at the time, well deserved booze.

Fast forward a month, and I have just given all my finals, got my 4.0 this term and I am happily preparing to go back home. I wake up one morning with an email from my email professor informing me that due to the content I uploaded he is gonna fail me in the class even if I passed it with an A. 
I immediately panic, I start freaking out.
To make matters worse, I get an email from my Physics professor with the same exact content, failing the class even though I passed it.

Now I am actually freaking the fuck out, I am an international student in the US so now I'm scared my visa is gonna get cancelled and that I am a dead man.

Next day I receive an email from the Director of Student Affairs asking to meet me to discuss the question. I'm hoping he will just give me a slap on the wrist and tell me to not do it again. I meet him and after a two hour meeting he informs me that most likely I will be expelled from the school, not allowing me to enroll at the university I was transferring to and ultimately revoking my visa. I get home and have an absolute breakdown, I can't tell my parents because they will fucking disown me so I have this weight on my back that's literally killing me. 

However, the decision wasn't final so the Director asks to meet me again the next week. Every day that passes it becomes worse. I don't know what to do with myself. I have so much shit going one that I start having suicidal thoughts, I am at the lowest point of my life (I've been lucky enough to never have experienced any real problems).
The day comes and the fucking Director tells me that he will not give me a final decision today and that he will contact me via email, due to the fact that I am leaving to go back to my home country and won't be in the States to personally see him.

I fly back home, and after approximately three days I get an email informing me that I have been suspended for the summer term, I have a 2500 word paper about Academic Integrity and my GPA has been lowered to a 1.0 for the term. However, I will be able to transfer to the University I was planning to go and I will get to keep my academic scholarship. 
Additionally, I have to write a paper of 2500 words about academic integrity that includes interview to two professors along with some other assignments that will be communicated me later.

Fast forward a couple of months and I am currently on a plane flying towards my new college, with a hue weight off my shoulders.


tl;dr I uploaded old college exams on the internet, went from a 4.0 to a 1.0 for the term, nearly got expelled and deported. 

EDIT: I forgot to add that I had to remove all the documents I uploaded, only way to do so was refunding the company that paid me via PayPal. So overall, I didn't end up earning one cent.

EDIT 2: Holy fuck this blew up way more than I expected.

I've been getting a lot of mixed reactions, people feeling bad for what happened (which they shouldn't) and people ripping my asshole apart (rightfully so).

Just to specify a few things that I might have gone over too quickly. 
The exams were semester old exams/weeks old, as I wanted to make sure nobody could benefit from the uploads as they would have been required to already take it.
Secondly my GPA for the term was lowered to a 1.0, this impacted my overall GPA a tiny bit but I was still
able to secure an academic scholarship at the university I transferred to.

I didn't post it the TIFU with the purpose of saying ""Fuck my College they are a bunch of douchebags"", it was more with the intent to show how little, at the time meaningless, actions can fuck up your future, big time.
Especially because I just assumed I would be able to do in the US things that I used to do in high school back at home.

I am grateful to the school for the course of action they took, as I know that things could have been way way worse.

"AITA for telling my boss his ""time theft"" concerns are not my problem?","The computers at my job are fairly crappy and require several minutes to boot.

Typically I come in, turn them on, check my phone messages, hit the head (long commute to work) then get going. It's around 5 minutes max.

I also pointed out that when he opens the building at 8am he could spend two minutes turning on everyone's (three people) computers, which would cut the wait time in half at least. Then I said that my time is as valuable to me as his is to him and even though it's ""just ten minutes"" they're MY ten minutes, not his and I'm not interested in donating my time for nothing.

The cream is so sweet that it even overpowers the great taste of the biscuit.
When eating Oreos with a glass of milk the cream is still this thick gooey mass that ruins the great combination of the biscuit and milk.

Personally I take the cream off before eating BUT it is stuck so badly that I cannot take it off completely. And any bit of residue gives you the same experience as taking a stick of butter, dipping it in sugar and then taking a good bite out of it.

Not too exciting but an update none the less.

Not long after the original post I ended up sending an email to my landlord with a copy of the letter from the HOA and explained my situation. The next day I received a phone call from my landlord and she said not to worry about it. According to her despite my lease stating that the ""Tenant agrees to abide by any applicable owners association regulations as they now exist or may be amended."" this was a rather unreasonable demand by the HOA and isn't something that should be held against me or any other tenants she has in the neighborhood. She said she would take care of the situation with the HOA and offered to pay any fines that resulted in the meantime.

As of today I have received another letter from the HOA that said until further notice they will not be enforcing the rule regarding parking of vehicles older than 10 years old.

I haven't received any violations from the HOA up to this point and have yet to hear anything else from my landlord.

"Found Hidden Camera in AirBnb (Seattle, WA)","My bf and I are staying at an airbnb in Seattle, we're basically living in the bottom unit (basement) and the hosts are directly above us. Everything seemed fine. Last night I went to use the charging cube and cable they had in the kitchen, for some reason it wasn't charging my phone so I took a closer look at it and saw that it was blinking. We shined a flashlight on the cube and realize it was one of those hidden camera charging cubes. It was in the kitchen but pointed straight at the bathroom, which means it has footage of us undressing (completely naked) and walking into the bathroom to shower. 



The hosts never informed us about this and we are really uncomfortable with the fact that it has footage of us without our consent. We contacted Airbnb but they are not super helpful and now we are considering calling the police to file a report. Is it legal for us to take the files from the cube (direct USB connection)? 


update 1: We called the police non emergency line, they won't give us an ETA or when they are coming but we have to wait for them. We only have 2.5 hours left until we have to check out . . . so I guess we will sit tight until then

Update 2: the couple left and went somewhere while we waited for the police. The police eventually did show up, made a report, took the camera as evidence, and tried to get a hold of the couple but couldn't. All my messages between myself and the host were wiped from the Airbnb app, I did not screen shot them but have copies of what the host said in my email. We are going to Mt Rainier for the next two days so I will keep you guys posted after. 

Update 3: Airbnb messages are back and I have full access now, will screen shot and keep safe! Thanks for all the advice and support, I'm just glad the police came and took care of it from there. Will look into lawyers once I'm back. Entering mt rainier now, will update later. 

Update 4: the host has contacted me and apologized stating that they did not know it was a camera and that some other guest had left it behind, they seemed a little upset and offended we would accuse them of such things. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that what he said was true. Airbnb refunded me the entire stay without me even asking and have temporarily suspended the host. They are starting their investigation and will communicate with the police. The police are still trying to see if they can get data off the device and are still doing their investigation. So that's where I'm at, it'll probably be a while before anything happens so I will make a separate update post when everything is settled. Thanks for the support everyone, it's been pretty terrifying and now I'm paranoid at every place I stay but I'm trying my best to just think of it as an isolated incident! ",legaladvice

My husband will only eat chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, and spaghetti-o's. That's it. When we go over to friends' places he'll actually bring some spaghetti-o's to heat up in their microwave instead of eating anything else, even if our friends cooked a wonderful meal.

If we go out somewhere to eat he will only order chicken nuggets off the kid's menu. If they don't have them, he just won't eat.

If I try to cook literally ANYTHING except one of his three food groups, he will claim he's allergic to some random ingredient instead of just outright saying he doesn't want to eat it. He'll then try to guilt me for ""forgetting"" his allergy. Spoiler: We've been to the doctor and he's not allergic to anything.

My husband just turned 36 this month. His food habits were sort of cute/acceptable when we were both in college and eating like trash, but now I'm genuinely worried about his health. I also find myself avoiding any sort of dining situations with our friends, which is so much harder than it sounds.

I've tried talking to him about his eating habits and just he brushes me off. Since I don't cook his meals (the only victory I've had in this situation) he doesn't think I have the right to ""dictate"" what he can and can't eat.

I'm not his mother. I'm his wife. But I just want my husband, the man I love, to be healthy.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/76strr/tx_pecan_tree_severely_cut_back_by_trimmers_who/

So my MIL had an arborist out who judged that, with some work and care, the tree should be able to survive the damage. By his appraisal, there was around $5500 in damage to the tree. Sadly, the photos my MIL was able to dig up weren't enough to let the arborist give a good estimate on how much the tree's nut production would be impacted, so she just went forward with that number.

She had a lawyer friend draft up a registered letter to the tree trimmers explaining the arborist's appraisal and her intentions to pursue repayment through whatever legal means were necessary. The trimmers came back with an offer to pay that amount but in 3 installments over the next year. She countered half immediately and half in a month. Two weeks later she gets contacted by the trimmer's insurance company and they sent her a single check for the full amount.

My Male coworkers and I have stupid ways of bonding including drinking competitions, paper basketball, and downloading suspicious apps on each other's phones. Basically, we act like we're children. We're in a 9-5 office job so we take any opportunity we can get to make things less boring. No one gets hurt and everyone has fun. UNTIL LAST NIGHT. 

We are all at a bar and pretty drunk and I went to take a slosh. My boss and my friend, Dave, came in after me while I was about to pee. We decided to see how far away we could stand from the urinal and still get everything in. Dave finished peeing and my boss was pretty far back so Dave pointed my boss out. I automatically turned and, since I'm a little taller than my boss, accidentally sprayed him with some of my golden nectar. On his dick. 

His response was ""what the fuck man?"" I think he thought I did it on purpose. I apologised and left really quickly and haven't seen him since. I'm not sure what to do now. I don't want to go back to work. Should I confront him about it or pretend it never happened? 

Advice please ...

Boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship,"My bf and I have been together for over 4 years. When we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. We stayed together long distance until I graduated and moved back home. We have lived together for about 2 years now. 

Life was very rough for him when he dropped out. His parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. He is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. Because of this, I have lent him money over the years. I was very fortunate in my situation where I went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. I have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. One thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. I am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

Last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. He told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. Because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. My perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. Sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (For example, we moved last week and I wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) It makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. But he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

I am very confused about our relationship right now. He will not remember this when he wakes up, but I don't know how to approach him with the things he said. I love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. But if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should I be doing?

Edit: I've changed the ocd to perfectionist. I'm so sorry to everyone I offended!

My husband worked for the same company for almost a decade. He earned a good salary, but the last few years were rough on him thanks to his overbearing boss. He discussed quitting every so often, and I was open to the idea as long as he had another job lined up.

&#x200B;

Well last year, he quit spur-of-the-moment over a seemingly minor dispute at work. He would later call it ""the straw that broke the camels back"". No other jobs lined up, nothing. He assured me that he had savings he could live on and that he wanted to take some time to ""re-calibrate"".  He also 'had a few business ideas' he wanted to pursue before getting back into the workforce. Trying to be a supportive partner, I said okay...

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today -- he has no income and literally hasn't sent out a single job application. He hasn't even updated his resume. What has he been doing these passed 8 months, you ask? Smoking weed, a bunch of scammy 'work-from-home' bullshit that hasn't made him a dime, and most recently, trying to become an 'Instagram Influencer'. Yes, seriously. 

&#x200B;

To be fair, he has also done some handy-work around the house and fixed up some things. But for the most part, he spends his days smoking weed and dicking around on Instagram, and I'm effectively subsidizing it -- we used to split bills 50/50, now it's more like 80/20.

&#x200B;

The last time I tried to have a serious talk about his future plans, he ""jokingly"" said I could divorce him and pay him alimony if I didn't like the current situation. Then he broke down and wept, saying that he might be depressed. I felt horrible for him and offered him my full support, but in retrospect, I'm curious if it was just a convenient excuse to pivot the conversation and get me off his back.

TIFU by letting my boyfriend pull out,"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons, even though this story takes place almost 15 years ago. 

I was new to having sexual relations with boys, as previously it was only ever my girlfriends who I explored with sexually before boys. So I didn't have a whole lot to go on as I didn't have regular internet access to view porn or search sexual questions. 

So anyway, my boyfriend and I are getting busy in his basement bedroom. I'm smart enough to be on the pill, and also we had both just gotten tested for STDs before starting to go further in our relationship. Because of these clean tests we decide to bareback the sexy times and he opt to pull out as well, just in case.

He aims and blows his load on my stomach. Except we can't find it to clean it up.  We looked everywhere and could not find his little splat of spunk. Then we hear the front door unlock and open and the sound of his younger siblings and parents. We quickly get dressed, I spray myself with body spray (good old Calgon) and head upstairs to pretend like we didn't just bang. 

I've only met his parents a couple times, and they are pretty easy going, especially as they let us sleep over in the same room. I have an uncommon female name and I'm often misnamed. So she reaches in for a hug and doesn't bother with my name, and then points out that I have a wet spot on my T-shirt. 

I have always had large enough breasts that I cannot see my tummy by just looking down. I have to lift my shirt. Well stupid me forgets the fiasco moments ago and I lift my shirt slightly to investigate this wet spot. Shining in the afternoon sun, is a long snot like string of jizz attached to my shirt from within my belly button.  His mum gives me this look and says I must have dropped my hair product or something and leaves it at that. I think I've gotten away with it. 

After dinner sometime as we are putting away dishes, she takes me aside and hands me a WAD of condoms. Not a word is said, just a handful of condoms. 

Now I occasionally see her walking in the mall and make awkward eye contact with her and she gives a weird smile. I know the only thing she thinks when she sees me is ""bellybutton full of cum""


TLDR: boyfriend pulled out and lost his load somewhere, but don't worry, his mum found it for me. 

Edit: front page and RIP inbox. I just woke up so I'll find a ruler for the belly button picture.

It is currently almost 3am in my time zone and this FU is currently still going on. At midnight, I officially turned 21. I came home from work to my wonderful girlfriend waiting for me with her gifts, one of which was a very powerful tea tree oil body wash. She was so well-intentioned but little did we know what this was going to turn into. 

I went to grab a quick shower and she insisted I try out the new fancy body wash. It was great to use, if anything a bit more minty than I was expecting but nothing too crazy. I came back and we decided to engage in some fun birthday ""activities"" together. Wasn't expecting this to be a problem and I really thought I had washed my hands well enough beforehand. I had not. 

The supposed fun and games quickly turned to tears and burning and me panicking to find out if we needed to go to the hospital. She is currently still writhing on the bed with a cold water bottle on her nether regions. Glad I'm starting 21 off right.

HELP!!! MY FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND CALLED HER BY MY NAME DURING SEX!!!!,"Hi, my (20F) friend (21F) is no longer my friend as of like a few hours ago because her boyfriend (21M) called her my name during sex. I've been so cooperative and supportive through all of her relationship. I used to date her boyfriend years ago and he treated me like royalty and would take me out everywhere and she was my friend through it all. About a year ago I guess they hit it off and I decided to distance from him (we were still friends) out of respect for her. 
She constantly vents to me about ME and about how he doesn't treat her half as good as he treated me and she doesn't understand it. I feel terrible but there is nothing I can do, I don't understand it either. I've always been aware he had a hard time getting over me but I guess a couple hours ago he called her by my name during sex. She blew up my phone about it and somehow took it out on me. Reminder; I haven't spoken to him outside of when I'm with both of them together in a year!!! 
He has called her by my name before but it's always been brushed off as a simple mistake. 
She insists we cannot be friends and I tried to apologize even though all of this is out of my control.
Advice??


UPDATE: after going through ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS (yes I read all of them) I feel there is some stuff to clear up. She asked me for permission to date him and I gave her the go ahead which is why him and I distanced. It was a mutual agreement, he also said that it would be best if we distanced for her sake. Our interactions are minimal at get togethers or whenever I go to see her because THEY LIVE TOGETHER. he has never been flirty or creepy towards me so I do believe it's an honest mistake. As for the comments that state that I ""am clearly not over him"" that relationship died years ago and I am with somebody happily. I want to take your advice and just ""drop them"" but this is years of friendship I want to save...

UPDATE #2: First of all thank you guys so much for the replies and help, you guys have, if anything, reassured me I did nothing wrong. I was not too sure before. I am also aware that this may not be a friendship worth saving as she has always been this way, always had to be right and I have always put in more effort. However, I do not mean to make this about something else but after high school I have been left with 2 friends, one of which was her. It's hard to think about my life being more empty than it already is and I feel like every single year I have less and less people in my life even though I am TRYING SO HARD to keep them around. I have been there for her and friends with her for 10 years and never through her fuckups even thought about ending the friendship. I'm just left wondering, once again, what it is about me that made everyone disappear after high school. Again, sorry if I'm turning this into something else. It's not my intention but the need to save the friendship is deeper than just ""oh I just want to be friends""",relationship_advice

My (20F) boyfriend (21M) made me lose $400 because he wanted to hang out with his ex,"The title is vague, let me explain - this is mostly a vent I guess

I bought tickets to see a broadway show, $200 a piece - the day of the show he told me he couldn't go because he had plans with his ex. When I told him the tickets were not refundable, he was still dead set on hanging out with his ex because he didn't want to hurt her feelings.

I don't know how to feel tbh.

EDIT: Yes, he agreed to go with me. He bailed out an HOUR before we were supposed to leave. He's not trying to win his ex back, she's actually the one obsessed with him and he doesn't see it.

I did reach out to other people to see if they wanted to come with me instead, no reply. 

I didn't go by myself because that wasn't the point of me buying the tickets. I didn't want to sit through the show upset about what just happened.


EDIT 2: I've read all your reply's, and 99% of you have valid advice. A little backstory, I met (let's call him Alex) on a dating app. 
When we first met, he told me he still saw his ex and that they slept together from time to time. I was grossed out, but I believe him we they said they were strictly friends. Alex and her hung out for awhile in our relationship. It was hard for him to have time for me because he was always with his ex.

One time, I called Alex because I was panicking over an event that happened - they were hanging out and she SCREAMED at him because he was on the phone with me. She threatened to kill her self if he didn't get off the phone with me. Alex, never hung the phone up and argued with her for hours before she drove away.

About the ""he doesn't see it part"" - all he used to tell me was he knows she's crazy but she's still his ""friend""
""She's still my friend"" he would say to me.

tl;dr - I'm aware of their ""platonic relationship"", She's crazy, he knows she's crazy. I don't say much to him about their relationship because I don't want to seem crazy. 

As of today, they are no longer friends. They don't talk - from what I'm aware of. I see him more. He's actually happy he doesn't see her anymore.

EDIT 3: I know I'm dumb. This happened when we first started dating. I'm just now sharing what happened.
Alex is a vulnerable guy, his ex definitely got into his head. I'm unsure if what I'm feeling is Retroactive Jealousy or if my feelings are rational. I'm pretty sure ever since they broke up - probably the entire relationship - she has been manipulating him. His family doesn't like her. His friends don't like her. I tried to be her friend, but she wouldn't budge. I've never met her.",relationship_advice

Hello all, i'm a bit overweight Forgot my age. I'm 25. Male. i'm 21%Bf going down, 106kg (233lbs) . And 1.77m  tall.  I used to be 18% and 101kg (222lbs) when i met her. But over the 3year course of our relationship i've gained weight.   I went to 25% bodyfat because i stopped working out. Now i'm lifting again and gone back down to 21%bf (just got messured)  

She is around 1.63m tall and 89-91kg (198-200lbs,) last time i knew which was 4 months back she was 91kg (200lbs)  she doesn't train anything she used to swim when i met her and back then she was 75kg (165lbs) 

So you all see we both have gained a bit fat. But i'm working on cutting but i got problem with binge eating at evening.  We do not live together but i know she has been watching TV show that involes many shirtless guys, of course all with ABS.  And yesterday i was at her place, watching this TV show with her. I tried to escalate, she said she didn't want to.  I said *oh okei*  then all of sudden she asks. *why can't you have six pack?*  i told her i was working on it (for myself not her) and she said she doesn't feel as much sexually attracted to me because i'm fat.  I couldn't say a word i just awkwardly laughed.   Then 20 min later i decided to go home.

She wasn't joking she was dead serious. Ever since she started watching TV shows like this our sex has decreased.  

I almost broke up with her because i feel like she doesnt deserve me when i loose my weight, she isn't doing anything about her weight. Is this acceptable off her?

AITA For skipping guy's night because the host's wife was there?,"  

So I have a pretty tight group of friends that have all been together r since elementary school. All early 30s now. Lately with people getting married and our careers we haven't had much time to spend together. So one of my friends suggested a long overdue guy's night. Just pizza and beers and catching up at a buddy's place. I said that I would order and pay for the pizza from our usual spot.

So the day of guy's night, I get a text from the host's wife (We'll call her Kim), asking me to pick up some pizza on the other end of the city. At first I was confused and then I found out that she basically just cancelled her plans with her girlfriends to interject herself into our guy's night. I told her that the place she wants to pick up from is on the other end of the city, plus we already had a place to order from. Kim had wanted to order a bunch of these super expensive, tiny thin-crust hipster pizzas. I tell Kim that we're a bunch of dudes that just want some regular filling pepperoni pizza to eat while we have a few drinks. The host texts me after to just say, ""Yeah, go ahead and just get the regular, its way easier."" So we go ahead and order the regular stuff. While I'm driving to his place, I get a message form Kim that reads something like the following:

""I think you're being really selfish here. I wanted to share something with you guys that I found amazing and have a new experience with you, but you decided that you just have to make this all about yourself. You know that Host isn't going to say no to anyone and you're just being mean to get your way.""

I told Kim , ""Just cancel the order, get whatever you want. I'm out"" and turned around and drove back home. To clarify, I wasn't upset about not getting my choice of food, but at the fact that Kim not only invited herself to what she knew was a guy's night and then started making demands about food for us and telling me to pick up the food that she wants when she was also off of work at this time. Kim is a bit of a spoiled princess that's used to getting everything she wants.

So I decided not to go, because if she was already getting this upset over something like pizza, then I don't want to spend one of my nights off around her. None of the guys were upset, they wanted me to come but understood why I bailed. One last thing is we all hang our pretty regularly as a group anyways. So Kim sees us all once every week or so anyways. It's not that the guy's never get to see each-other, but we just haven't had a guy's only night in nearly a year.

"[UPDATE] I have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! And my landlord's response was: ""If you don't like it- just move out!""","[Here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

I have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400CAD a month) in my apartment in Ontario, Canada.

&#x200B;

Based on all of the advice I received from the original post – here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200B;

**I managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* I noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month I was consistently consuming around 2600 kWh. No matter the month – no matter if I was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* I also checked the specific weeks where I was on vacation. I was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- I paid around $70 for each week I was away. A total of $140 I paid when I wasn't even home for two weeks!
* Furiously, I called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit Is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* She also Informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**The inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* I was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* The Inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* The closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! Feeding hot water to all the units.
* To prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! Meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* Also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

After emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. We noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). After he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. I had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200B;

**Yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *My boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* Instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. He is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* My boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and FIX this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* The landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**If you don't like it- just move out!""**

**I am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* Due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* Since my boyfriend and I are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with NO hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**My question to all of you:**

1. What do I do now?... Can I trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own – even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. What happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. Do I need a lawyer?

Thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200B;

***EDIT!***

* Thank's to all of you who commented last night! - Unfortunately the comments got locked before I could even reply to any of you! 
* I am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on Monday!

AITA For telling her to fuck off?,"I was dating this girl for almost two years, and everything is going fine. We didn't have any arguments or fights or other ""couple drama"" that you'd think of.

It was a point that really irritated me, but as I'm really antisocial and hate conflicts, I leave it be because I genuinely loved her. 

Cue four months ago when she decides to break up with me by inviting me over in the middle of the night, just for me to walk in on her getting it from another guy. I was pissed and just left and went NC on her. A month ago she tries to reach out to me to apologize and get me to forgive her, which I don't, and I tell her to leave me alone. Now all night she was blowing up my phone while I was at work, after I got off I answered and she was balling her eyes out telling me her dad just died and she needed someone, but I don't care so I told her to fuck off and find someone who gives a fuck about her. I feel bad because I still do have a lot of feelings for her, but I don't want anything to do with her.

(Washington) I bought my son's friend a hamburger and some hot dogs and his mom is reporting us to CPS for child endangerment.,"As my kids are about to go back to school, we decided to have a fun weekend. I took both my kids and one friend each to a Mariners game this weekend. While there, we had cokes, hot dogs, garlic fries, peanuts, and burgers before the game. All basic baseball game junk food. I am always shocked at how much it costs but we had fun so I didn't mind. Last night, my son's friend's mom called us and started screaming on the phone that we allowed her son to eat meat. She said her son is a strict vegetarian and that is how they have brought him up and that we had no right to give him food that she doesn't allow. I know the boy pretty well as he's basically got free rein of the house since they've been friends for years. When he spends time with us, there have always been veggie options for him, but for a while now, he has decided to eat meat with the rest of us. He's 15 years old, and I figured he can choose to eat whatever he wants when he's in our home. I don't care. But according to her, I should have refused to let him eat meat at the game and bought him something else. She didn't seem to be aware that he's been eating meat at our house for about a year. She said she's going to file a complaint with CPS for child endangerment and interference with parental rights Monday morning. I always thought her elevator didn't make it quite to the top floor, but this seems completely bonkers to me. Do I have anything to worry about here?",legaladvice

I confronted him. I asked if he had ever been unfaithful. He looked like he was about to say no then he admitted four women and the nanny. Two were in a city he travels to frequently. One was a one night stand on a trip. And one was local. All told, he had a mistress for about seven of the thirteen years we were married. I can't imagine what the women went through. If they didn't know he was married, then they were victims. If they did know, then I hope they find peace from whatever demon caused them to sleep with a married man.  


I think I could've stayed with him if it had just been the women. Maybe, I can't say for sure. But the nanny was a violation of trust and an act of a troubled man. She had to fear for her job. I can't blame her in any way, and I'll reach out to her when the time is right to make sure again she knows she's loved.  


The kids cried when we told them. He's at an Airbnb until he can find more permanent housing. I'll stay here with the kids. The current nanny is moving in for the foreseeable future and my mother is coming to help. We'll all be ok.   


I did want to say one last thing. There were those who came into the original thread with hatred in their heart towards my husband's accuser. I looked at the place you came from, and it's vile and hurtful. I hope whatever pain in your life, current or past, that caused you to spew such hatred is exorcised and you find peace and love.

I told my boyfriend (18M) that night, and maybe I'm just expecting the same type of care I would give.

TIFU by encouraging my husband in bed and ruining sex for the day NSFW,"So as usual, this wasn't today but last weekend.
After a busy workweek where me and my husband had been coming home, and pretty much passing out at the end of the day, we figured a Saturday afternoon would be the perfect time for some quality alone time.
I'd been teasing him for the morning whilst we did general household chores and finally dragged him upstairs mid afternoon to get down to business! 

Everything started off brilliantly, the clothes got thrown, things got hot and quickly led into some excellent 69ing.
Now, my husband is deft of finger and pretty quickly had me moaning with pleasure and a very intense orgasm. 
We quickly switched to him on top and i was encouraging him to go harder so that he could have a great finish as well. Still all good so far! I continued to egg him on, telling him to step up his game and FINISH HIM. (no body slam moves required)
....

After a particularly enthusiastic thrust I suddenly got a stab of pain in my side, making me curl up in agony. He mistook this for intense pleasure (apparently my pain face is similar to my sexy face? Not sure how to take that one!) and kept going for a couple more plunges before it finally became obvious to him as I burst into tears!

This lead into him panicking that he'd somehow broken me with his cock (he may be overestimating there) and me trying to figure out WTF had just happened and why I was crying. I'm guessing it something to do with the lovely stabbing cramps in my right hand side of my abdomen. Possibly.
Cue the naked running around as he grabs hot water bottle and glass of water while I curl up on the bed, now very lacking in sex appeal.

Turns out that if you have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), 'enthusiastic exercise' can sometimes cause a ovarian cyst to get over excited and burst! 

Worst part was, we were trying to fit in this fun time before his parents came over for dinner and now, 20 minutes before they arrive am now stuck in an ungainly position on the bed, totally starkers for all to see. 
I had to phone his mum to ask if she had any ibuprofen she could bring round for me as we had none in the house and then had to try and explain exactly why I needed them. Luckily she had the sense to not ask any further questions when i said it can be triggered by certain types of exercise.

Managed to get husband to help me pull some clothes on moments before they arrived, so saved some of my dignity at last.
He's now convinced his dick is cursed and is going to break me again.

AITA for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an April fools joke?,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


Am I the asshole?

TIFU by playing a joke on a colleague who took it seriously. I ended up losing a vacation day and got a disciplinary action in my file.,"I worked for a Workman's Compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - Todd - who was mildly annoying.  Nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  He enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  Little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. It got to be enough, so I decided he needed some payback.

He paid out a claim that was HUGE and he was nervous about it. I don't know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so I waited. About a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but Todd), I said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.

A couple of days after that, I stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, ""Did you payout x-amount on the Smith file?"" He said he had and asked me why. I just walked away.

The following Monday, I had my plan laid out fairly well.  After sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that I borrow his black surplus Impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. Then, early that morning, I went about putting crime scene tape across the door to Todd's his office.

I had the receptionist in on it too. When Todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.

Todd made it to the top of the steps when I rushed up to him and said, ""Dude - go, just go!""

""What the hell are you talking about?"" He asked.

""Just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!""

He shrugged me off, but I could tell that he was a little rattled. He turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. He walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. He ended up slipping out through the stairwell.

He was gone for nine hours. I had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.

His absence meant that management got involved. I had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. I got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and I lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.

Todd doesn't tape my mouse anymore.

AITA for not letting this mom send her younger son to my son's birthday party?,"My son (10) made a pretty good friend (10) within the last schoolyear. They are pretty inseparable and do everything together. I would arrange playdates for the mom, saying I'd pick both boys up from school and when I'd get there, I'd find out the mom had also made me responsible to pick up the boy's younger brother (5) too. She says that his feelings get hurt if he also doesn't have a playdate. When the little boy comes over, my son and his friend tire of him quickly. They don't want him to play with them and while I try to encourage group play, it's just a lot on them. They want to play with different things with him. Typically, the little boy ends up following me or my older daughter around. 

This happened quite a few times throughout the school year. I thought it might stop in the summer, but when I went to pick up the 10-year-old, the 5-year-old was ready to go too and how could I say no to him, when he was all ready? He's just a kid and it's not his fault his mom is doing this.

 If I try to talk to the mom, she just says that the little brother gets insanely jealous and that he loves coming to my house. My son overall doesn't mind him coming, so long as he stays out of my hair and I can manage it.

Now, my son is having his 11th birthday party. He's having a simple birthday sleepover with a few friends, including the older brother of this 5-year-old. I talked to the mom and said that it was just for the ""big boys"", and please don't tell the 5-year-old he could come. I'd be too busy that night to play buffer. She got really offended and tried to say they were a packaged deal. I gently explained that it couldn't continue. She finally relented, but said that her son was going to be very hurt.

Am I being an ass here? I feel bad, but I feel she's the only setting her son up for failure here. (Not why I said he couldn't come, my son doesn't want him there and I just don't have to watch him.)",AmItheAsshole
"LPT: 15 years Repairing Electronics Here: With Liquid Damaged Electronics, DON'T Use Rice, Instead Use A Fan (explanation inside)","I've spent nearly 20 years repairing liquid/water damaged electronics. More specifically, cell phones. In the old days, we'd open the phones up, clean the corrosion, resolder, etc. Recently, they've (the manufacturers) moved away from local repairs and moved more towards warranty replacements, swap outs (FRU = factory replacement units) & insurance. Now if you want your electronics repaired locally, you have to visit 3rd party independent people since you can no longer have it done in a corporate-ran store.

I know rice is the go-to recommendation for water damaged phones and other electronics, and it works, to an extent. It will **passively** absorb moisture. Unfortunately, you don't want to passively absorb the moisture, you want to *actively* **remove** the moisture as quickly as possible.  The longer the moisture is sitting on those circuit boards, the higher the risk of corrosion. And corrosion on electrical components can happen within just a few short hours. If the damage isn't severe, we'd take contact cleaner (essentially 92% or better rubbing alcohol, the higher the percentage, the quicker it will evaporate) and scrub the white or green powder (the corrosion that formed) with a toothbrush to remove it. If that corrosion crosses contacts, it can cause the electronics to act up, fail or short out. The liquid itself almost never is directly responsible for failed consumer electronics, it's the corrosion that takes place after the fact (or the liquid damaging the battery, a new battery fixes this issue obviously). 

Every time I see someone recommend rice I kinda twinge a little inside because while it does dry a phone out slightly better than just sitting on a counter, it really doesn't do much to prevent the corrosion that's going to be taking place due to the length of time the liquid has had to fester inside the phone or whatever. 

What you want to do is set the item in front of a fan with constant airflow. Take the device apart as much as you can without ruining it (remove the battery, etc) so that the insides can get as much airflow as possible. Even if it's not in direct contact with the air, the steady air blowing over the device will create a mini vacuum effect and pull air from inside. It's just a small amount but it's significantly better than just allowing the rice to passively absorb the evaporated moisture. True, rice can act as a desiccant, but a fan blowing over whatever is orders of magnitude faster. 

I personally will take apart a piece of electronics completely, and put those items in front of a fan, and if you have the relevant knowledge, I highly recommend doing so as well. But if you don't, it's not that big of an issue. What you want to avoid at all costs, however, is **heat**. Do not put your phone inside an oven or hot blow dryer, heat can damage electronics just as bad as liquid, sometimes more so. Heat, extreme cold and liquid are bad for electronics & cell phones. A fan (lots of airflow) is 99 out of 100 times better at removing moisture quickly than rice. I would say 100 out of 100 but I'm sure there's going to be some crazy situation or exception I haven't thought of that someone will come in and point out. I'd like to remind people that exceptions are just that, they don't invalidate the rule. ",LifeProTips
"[California] We are a small indie porn company. Former model wants her videos removed, unwilling to buy the copyright. Sends threatening messages. [Update]","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6xjs4q/california_we_are_a_small_indie_porn_company/

There is a lot to discuss. We did a little research and turned out her stories about getting married and her husband wanting the videos to go down were lies. She in fact is starting a membership program on her own website and wanted to use that excuse to get our videos at reduced prices, to post them later to her own website. She wanted to use the exclusivity to get some of our paid members and have a larger library at launch.

Once she realized that we know of her plan, she offered to pay the full $700,000 however, we declined since we have no interest in allowing her to use our videos to compete with us. She even offered to pay $1 million if we agreed to take down the videos immediately upon the sale. We of course declined and informed her that we are no longer willing to discuss terms about selling our copyright. One other small studio that she has worked in the past had already fallen for her lies and sold her the videos at non-competing prices. We're happy we didn't.

We learned a new lesson. People lie in business to get better deals. ",legaladvice

AITA for mentioning that I had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor?,"I'm posting this from my wife's account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I'm the asshole. 

This is a topic we've been debating for the past almost two years now. It'd be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

My perspective (husband):

My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. 

After eating something delicious, I can't quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I'm talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn't want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife's contractions started to pick up. 

Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

Wife's perspective:

My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he'd complain I'd say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn't in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. 

I'd like to also mention it wasn't just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours.

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.

"My (35m) wife (35f) nearly died in hospital, her family doesn't care and now I don't know how to act around my in-laws","**Tl;dr** – Over the summer, we discovered my wife has a rare heart condition and nearly died. Three open-heart surgeries, two months in the ICU, and being put on the heart transplant list, and her family did little more than check in occasionally. I'm pissed and hurt, but don't know what to do about it.

So here's the story. Buckle in, it's long. Throwaway because some of her family lives on Reddit and will probably see this. If you think this song is about you...

A few weeks before Easter, my wife started not feeling well. Just breathless and really tired all the time. She went in for some blood work and they discovered she was in heart failure. It went real critical, real fast. We never even celebrated Easter—my kid's Easter basket, full of Dora the Explorer toys and candy, is still hidden in the bottom of my closet.

We went from ""nothing's wrong, maybe a mild flu that she can't shake"" to the ER at our local hospital, transferred to the city hospital, and being told that we need to get her on the heart transplant list ASAP. After a month at the city hospital, with me driving an hour there and back with our kid to visit her daily, her family had not bothered to come visit her ONCE. They lived about 30ish minutes away from the city hospital. 

I should stop here and mention that my wife and I are better off financially than the rest of her immediate family. I fully am aware this is because I had a wealthy family, good education, and a great job that lets me work flexible hours and do extra jobs on the side. Her family—mother (60s), brother (32), and sister (34)—aren't as well off. Mother works at WalMart and makes ends meet. Brother has a decent job but just in general has trouble keeping his shit together, but he tries. Sister is a stay at home mom—they budget well, but don't have a lot of disposable income. 

In the past, I have been the safety net for her family. Brother's car breaks down, we've paid to fix it. Sister has a health issue, we've paid his medical bills. We've even done some family vacations where we paid for the rental property on the beach and groceries. We never demand repayment (although we accept it when/if they do), and my attitude has always been ""money is just a thing, but family is important."" Maybe I felt this way because I didn't have any family left.

That said, I always also thought we'd be ""paid back"" emotionally, if that makes sense? I thought they'd be there for us when we needed it. When my wife first went to the city hospital, I'd drop my kid off at the mother's house in order to visit with wife. Mother insisted I didn't need to pay her for babysitting, but after the first week, when it became apparent that my wife wasn't getting better quickly and this was a long term situation, I felt bad just dumping my kid off, and instead kept her with me when I visited. 

The first few weeks, I didn't think anything of the fact that her family didn't come visit, even though they lived a little closer to the city hospital. Mother, sister, brother all work (brother with odd hours), and none of them have the best cars (or money for parking, etc.). 

Then things got progressively worse. My wife's other organs started failing. We had to speak to palliative care, which freaked me the fuck out. Eventually, the city hospital said they couldn't take care of my wife and give her a rare operation, and we'd be transferred to a major hospital 250+ miles away. I called her family and basically said ""if you want to see her before she's transferred—and maybe before she literally DIES—come now."" 

They did come that day and stayed with her several hours. I felt like a tool, because it was clear that the mother was upset and kind of freaked out and didn't know how to deal with the idea that her daughter was so sick. 

But also...JFC. It'd been a month at that point, and this was the first time they'd visited her in the hospital. 

After that, wife was transferred by ambulance to the major hospital. She spends another few weeks in ICU there, while they get her health up to as good as possible before the first major surgery. Me and the kid are living in a trashy motel—we are okay financially, but we can't afford weeks and months at a nice hotel. I'm feeding my kid nuggets out of the motel microwave and dealing with daily visits at the hospital in a city we aren't used to.

It was stressful as fuck, guys. Not just seeing my wife, who's only 35 years old, suddenly take a nosedive in health for a rare condition we didn't know she had, but also being the sole provider for my kid and worrying about her mental health as she sees her mom dying. I was torn on how much to let my kid see versus how much to let my wife see my kid... I started taking pictures and thinking about which one would be the last family picture we had together. I talked to the hospital's child psychologist for my kid. 

And also, I did a lot of freelance work, because I knew these bills were coming. My days were: wake up before the kid, sneak out of the motel bed, work, kid wakes up, get her dressed, go to the hospital, come back to the motel, try to find a way to make my kid's day bright and not depressing as fuck, get kid to bed, work until I passed out. 

Look guys, I don't want pity or to come off as a whiner, but...I was dealing with a lot in this. And I had no help. My family is either dead or living in a different state. All our friends are in our hometown, not the major hospital city. 

All my wife's family—not just the mother, brother, and sister, but also the aunts, uncles, etc.—live in about the same area. And yeah, that's a 3-4 hour drive from the major city hospital, but at most 45 minutes from the first city hospital, and the only ones who visited her there were the m, b, s, and that was only after I basically begged them to come see her. No one, not one goddamn person, visited her at the major city hospital. Not before the first risky surgery, not in the full month of recovery after it. 

Not. 

One.

Goddamn.

She's been in hospitals for about three months now. She's spent most of that time in ICU. She's had three open heart surgeries, and is coming home with implants and drugs and basically a whole new handicapped life.

And her family doesn't give a shit. 

After she had the last surgery, she mentioned, in a very quiet, sad voice, ""do you think anyone else is going to come up and visit me?""

My heart fucking broke. As soon as I left her room, I texted her whole family—all of them, not just her immediate fam. I offered my wife's car for them to drive. I offered money for gas and food. I offered to pay for them to stay overnight at the hotel. 

The mother and brother both said they'd come up, just needed to get time off work. 

Spoiler: they never came. 

The sister said she was planning to come up in a few weeks. 

Spoiler: that was last week and she didn't come. 

They all had excuses. 

But jfc. Three months in the hospital. One visit—after I guilted and begged, and only because it was at the closer hospital.

As for the rest of her extended family, I also sent them all the information on this program the major city hospital does, where you can basically send an email to the hospital, and they print it up and make it look like a card. Literally as simple as a fucking email, and guess how many of them did it? One cousin—the one member of her extended family that lives on the opposite side of the country. 

No one else could even be arsed enough to send a fucking ""get well soon"" email.

Meanwhile, my friends called and offered help. I had one friend drive two hours to spend a day with my kid so she could have a break. College buddies I've not seen in years saw my Facebook post and sent me $100 gift cards or gift cards to meal delivery and stuff. I say this because (a) it's not like I was being secret about how grave the situation was, and (b) any normal human being could see this is one of those situations where we need help. And while yes, the money helped, what we really needed was fucking emotional support or something. 

Now before it sounds like we're in a Victor Hugo novel, I should say that her family has a Facebook messenger chat thing, and they did keep up with her there. So I guess I can't say they didn't care, but...

IDK, am I being an asshole about this? I realize that they have jobs that aren't as flexible as mine, but three months. Major surgeries. She nearly fucking died. 

And they didn't come visit. They didn't even send a fucking email. 

And I saw the way she was hurt. I saw the hope fade from her eyes when she thought her mom was coming, and then she didn't. 

And I saw my kid, dragged from hospital to motel and back again, because I didn't have any help with her in the other city. Wife's sister was going to bring her kids up so that my kid could spend some time with them at the motel pool and she could visit with my wife. My kid cried when she found out her cousins weren't coming. It was the ONLY thing she had to look forward literally this whole summer---one day where she could have fun, and my wife's sister didn't come.

I always thought to myself that it didn't matter if I loaned out money or whatever to my wife's family because I could always count on them to be there for us when we needed it. 

We needed it. 

And they weren't there.

And now...I don't know how to react or deal with them. Because every time I think of them, I'm filled with rage and resentment. 

But...my kid loves them. And my wife loves them. And they're more important in this situation. I'm ready to salt the earth with these fuck ups, but my wife is recovering from a major illness and it's not like she needs drama. And I don't have family left on my side, and don't want my kid to be alone. 

So, Reddit hive mind...what should I do? I can swallow my own emotions and play nice around her family. Now that my wife is coming home soon, they all want to visit (on their sweet time, at our house—basically, now that it's not inconvenient any more). And she's happy, so I'm not saying anything. I know she's hurt by the way they didn't bother with her, but I don't feel like it's my place to put it into words: Your family is shit, and they just proved it. 

So I guess I'm at a point where I feel like I just have to grin and bear it. Maybe in the future, I'll excuse myself from being around them. I know I'm not going to be there financially for them unless it's a life or death situation. But is there a better way to act, or something else I should do? Should I bring this up to my wife--ever?",relationship_advice

TIFU by falling asleep while tanning next to an attractive girl,"There's no obligatory ""this didn't happen today"" because this happened a few hours ago and I'm still mortified.

I'm on holiday with family and on a cruise, we all decided it would be a great idea to go tanning after a long walk around the city we're docked in. We went to the tanning area on the top deck and I split from my family as there wasn't many beds free and I saw a bed open next to this really attractive girl who looks early 20s (same as me) and I think I could have a good shot here so I occupy that bed and make a few bits of chit chat until the tiredness from the walk kicks in and I completely deck out and fall asleep right there. I must've moved around a lot while asleep because I woke up 15 minutes later by a family member telling me to cover myself up as one of my balls was hanging out of my shorts. 

First thing I did was cover up then look to the side to see the girl is no longer there but probably saw just like everyone else who walked past in the 15 minutes. I'm on this ship another week and the embarrassment will live with me forever. Help.

TL;DR: fucked up my chances with a girl by my own nutsack that fell out while I was sleeping

EDIT: Saw the girl in the breakfast room and after a while of thinking of what to say I went up and talked to her it went along the lines of ""so I don't know if you was there but I showed off a little more than intended yesterday"" she said she left before that happened to go for dinner but would've found it hilarious so I guess that's a massive win! I said I'll catch up with her later and she sounded happy with that so I guess it wasn't a complete embarrassment!

AITA for not going to bed at my Wife's bedtime?,"Both 25, married for a year.

Wife is a teacher and needs to be up at 5AM, I don't need to be up till 8AM. She goes to bed every night at 10PM and I grew up a night owl, I enjoy staying up late past that for alone time and to dork around on my PC.

I always go to bed with her because I love her and genuinely enjoy laying next to her and kissing her goodnight, but she has become increasingly aggressive and frustrated by me leaving around 10:30 to go into the other room. She doesn't want to be alone, but typically we spend every moment together from the moment I walk in the door after work.

I struggle with boundaries and I am a people pleaser, so right now we have this unhealthy dynamic where I wait for her to doze off and I sneak out and if she catches me I tell her that I'm going to go get some water or something. It is making everything worse and I feel like I am lying to her.

I need perspective on this. One of my first ever Reddit posts so forgive me for missing etiquette or formatting.

Thanks.

Edit- Thanks for all the comments, I genuinely appreciate it. Surprised how large this got.

I think the solution is to sit down at a time things are calm and have a conversation about my boundaries on this. I want to be there and enjoy that quality time while she relaxes and falls asleep, but she needs to understand that I would rather spend my day with her while she is awake and spend some alone time when she is already sleeping.

TIFU by wearing a Halloween costume to school,"this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.

I thought that because it was Halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but NOPE!

NOT A SOUL.

Nobody wore or did ANYTHING to celebrate. I know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion I spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. I'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state I'm only at school like 50% of the time, and I thought ""maybe this time I can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy Halloween.

its safe to say I was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if I see someone else with a costume on I might feel better but this was overkill, I'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that I likely wont be made fun of but costuming will ALWAYS be my passion and someday I will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

late august of 2017, it is to my belief, that i was drugged, raped & nearly strangled to death by two people i worked with. 

upon escaping the apartment i was in, i had to find someone in the complex to call 911 for me. the two people in question fled the scene, & the local pd took 20 minutes to arrive.* 

    *i awoke completely nude, groggy. i quickly found my clothes & got dressed. i heard the shower running, & i noticed white powder around the cup of hot choc. i had been drinking. i light a cigarette & grab my phone. the female in question comes out of the bedroom, & asks what i'm doing. i tell her i'm leaving, that i don't care what happened & that i just want to leave & go home. she makes a slick move for my car keys & i'm like ?? i'm just trying to leave dude. i turned around to grab my phone purse & she jumped onto my back & began strangling me. she puts me on the ground & i go in & out of consciousness. i literally thought i was going to die, i'm crying ""why me, why me"" saying my hail marys... i catch a moment to breathe & my fight/flight kicks in. i take my cig & burn her arm & face.. she released & i turned over & grabbed my purse.. pulled out pepper spray & sprayed her. i kicked her & took off running with my purse out her apartment door. i'm screaming, ""HELP CALL 911!"" ... it took me forever to get someone to come out & call 911. i was bare foot, in a flannel w no bra & panties w some cloth shorts...


i was transported to a local hospital where i waited an hour & a half for a SANE nurse. i was told she was on her way(aprox. 45 mins-90 mins) but i had a panic attack/existential crisis & requested i be taken back to my car. *

  * the two people took off in the mans car. they locked the apartment & therefore the police had to wait for a search warrant before entering the apartment to retrieve my phone & keys. after getting the warrant, they go in & my phone is gone but my keys are there. theres dildos, collars, drugs, blood & a bunch of other weird ass shit i dont wanna talk about. they inform the officer thats with me & thats when i decided to leave bc i needed to get ahold of my friends mom or someone. i was completely alone & estranged from my family.. i was 18 years old at this time.

once i get my keys & a way to contact my friends family, i go back to the hospital & wait 14 hours to do a rape kit. i completed but once the SANE nurse left, i left. i didnt fully check out because it had been nearly 24 hours & i wanted to go back to my friends & shower & fucking sleep. 

the days following, i have no contact with my detective. a full statement is never taken from me, & the two people are still MIA. i end having to quit my job bc coworkers hear about what has happened. they think im lying, even thothe two people in question are shady with criminal records. i phone my detective 5 days later asking for an update, to which he responds hes, ""been very busy withchild abuse & domestic violence cases."" & he would, ""do his best to try & prioritize my case"" i mentally shut down after this... i was 900$ in the hole with my phone being stolen & had 200$ to my name after having to leave my job. 

for months i hear nothing, i leave voicemails with the pd & det. & i get no response.. email inquires never go far & it was hard to get anything going. when i went to file restraining orders they didnt go thru because the charges had been dropped. the male cleared his name & claimed i was on a consensual, rape fantasy esque lesbian escapade. that he tried to pull the female off me & we got in a ""cat fight"" because, ""you know how crazy lesbians are."" (i am not a lesbian, & had a boyfriend at the time) i was under the impression the female was suppose to be my friend, not a romantic interest. 
the whole case is apparently dropped, i'm considered a washed up, lesbian drug addict & the dna is whatever.

today, october 1st of 2018, i received a voicemail from a det. at the pd claiming there was a hit on the male dna found near my peri anal, neck, & thighs.. & that they want to purse the case further....

Okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. I'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

A friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. She had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. I don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do I even really know the full story yet. She is not really the prank playing type and I guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

It looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. After I started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. Well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. I guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

Anyway, I texted her and I told her that I knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. She started blowing my phone up apologizing. She said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. She also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that I was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

I just didn't really respond to her. I left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. My family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. Our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. I'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

I don't really know where to go from here. I don't know if I should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. I'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as I'm awake with this Jameson.

After signing up a police officer asked me and my girlfriend to have a word. I will not say who he was but he was basically aware of the situation and he thought that we should not be there. He assured us that we should be fine even before the hearing started.

There were couple incidents we heard prior to ours and they all were related to dogs biting humans. We were the only ones there over a dog fighting another dog.

They called the person who sued me on stand and that's when the show started. He did really put a show for everyone.

He mentioned that his dog was dead for minutes but he resuscitate his dog. He mentioned that there were blood everywhere. He started crying and sobbing. He actually said that he tried to pull his dog from my dog's mouth but he though his dogs skin was coming off. I know it sounds all bad but don't worry because none of this happened and his dog was fine. My dog did really bite him but it was a bark bite where he penetrated skin only and let go. He had pictures with him and he thought those pictures would help his argument but it really did not. It looked like the dog just got scratched.

Once he was done, it was our turn to speak. We kept it cool and explained what happened. We told the judge what we were doing to make sure this would never happen again. I also mentioned how he was asking for money and refusing to show me any bills. And that was it.. I called 3 weeks later and I was notified that our dog was not deemed danger to anyone.

&#x200B;

I know it's been a while and people who gave me opinions here most likely won't see it but I wanted to thank everyone.

&#x200B;

TL;DR My dog bit another dog over ball. It wasn't serious injury at all. Owner demanded 1k$ + more in time. I agreed but wanted to see bills and owner freaked out and sued us and tried to get my dog put down. He failed and my lovely boy is next to me now.",legaladvice

Three men go to hell and they're pissed,"""Surely we weren't that bad?"" they ask themselves. ""There has to be something we can do to get out of here.""

Satan suddenly appears and says ""Oh, but there is! Withstand ten whippings from my trusty whip here and you're free to go. I'll even let you pick something to cover your back with""

The men let out a cheer. This wouldn't be so hard.

The first man steps up and observes his surroundings. Finally, he picks a sturdy looking boulder to place on his back. ""Ready,"" he says.

Satan raises his whip and yells, ""ONE!""

CRACK

The boulder immediately splits in half.

""Aw fuck this,"" says the first man. ""I'll just stay.""

Satan smirks and asks, ""Who's next?""

The second man steps up and, without picking any protection, gets in position.

""Are you sure about that?"" asks Satan, to which the man replies with

""I have trained my mind and body to ignore any unnecessary pain. I need no protection.""

""Whatever you say, pal."" Satan raises his arm and yells, ""ONE!""

CRACK

The man slightly flinches, his pain evident, but he remains upright.

Annoyance flashes across Satan's face. He raises his arm again and shouts, ""TWO!""

CRACK

Again, the man remains upright, all the way up to the tenth whipping.

The man gets up, weary but happy. Satan looks furious and says, ""Whatever, goodjob. You, third guy, you're next. What are you picking?""

The third man takes in his surroundings, lays his eyes on his choice and says, ""I'm gonna pick the second guy.""

TIFU buying a 23 and me kit assuming my history is boring.,"My TIFU actually started 3 days ago, but background first. My Dad was 56 and my mom was 46 when me and my twin sister were born. My dad died in 2007 when my twin sister and I were 12. He had been a heavy drinker and smoker since he was 10, passing at 69 following decades of very poor health so it was mostly a relief when he died. 

My mom and dad were married since 1973 and tried for many years to have children until they had my sister and I in 1994. My mom only has us but my dad had a son from a prior marriage who is about 30 years older than us who I've met several times but we aren't close due to the age difference. He also had 2 daughters from another prior marriage that I had never met, I only know they live in California and first names. They also did not speak to my dad and didn't attend his funeral. 

As I've gotten older and had kids of my own, I became more curious about my dads family. I asked my mom to no avail, she said she had no idea about why the girls didn't speak to my dad. She said she also didn't know how to contact them. I ordered a 23 and me kit to hopefully find my half sisters and get some answers. 

Also, the idea of possibly being 1% black or Asian would have been cool. I'm white as can be. 

So I order the kit and 3 weeks later get my results. Unfortunately, I am not any shocking ethnicity. 61.2% British actually along with  20.7% French/German and other European make-up.

What is surprising though is that I found 4 half sisters! 2 more than I thought! My dad was not a picture of moralism so it doesn't surprise me he had some unclaimed kids running around. So, excitedly, I click to see the names. 

Oddly, none of the names match my half sisters I'm looking for. This means I have 6 half sisters! Wow, dad was kind of a whore but this is still exciting. My twin and I immediately message them on the site. 

The first to reply we'll call Mary, she says she was born via IVF in 1992 in North Carolina. Mary also said the donor was a med student. WELL, my mom is adamant my Dad didn't donate to sperm banks and that he didn't live in the state she's from. So I'm thinking poor Mary doesn't know her mom is lying to her about an affair she had with my Dad. I felt terrible for my mom as well as this would definitely mean he cheated on my mom. 

Like I said, my Dad was scummy. 

I just tell Mary that my (our) father was actually in construction his whole life so he or the agency was lying about med school. He dropped out in 7th grade! I sent her some pictures of my dad and my twin and I from childhood. We laugh about how much we look alike and say we could even be triplets. 

Later that evening, I get another message from another half sister we'll call Tiffany. Tiffany says she was also conceived via IVF in 1993 in Pennsylvania. All she knows is her dad has blonde hair and green eyes and was a med student. 

I'm honestly so happy to see another IVF because this confirms my Dad did use sperm banks and just didn't tell my Mom. Which was shitty, but better than an affair. 
I send Tiffany pictures of my Dad and tell her about him and that's it. 

Then comes last night. I'm shopping at IKEA with my friends relaying this soap opera story to them. I'm telling them my theory about these sperm banks lying to their customers to get better prices. Telling people they're getting a blonde hair green eyed med student when in reality they're getting a brown hair brown eyed sheetrock worker. 

It's at this moment my friend ""Miranda"" said ""You and your twin have blonde hair and green eyes...what if your Dad isn't your Dad and your mom also used IVF?"" 

At first I laughingly entertained the idea that it would make sense for my mom to need IVF because that makes way more sense than suddenly becoming pregnant at 46 and 56. 

I quickly realized ""Holy shit that actually does make sense."" 

Then came the obvious thought to probably everyone but me...how could a 55 year old alcoholic chain smoker pass for a med student? It would have been 25 years since he could BELIEVABLY look under 35. Unless they somehow had his sperm in storage for 30 years before using it,  AND the sperm banks in different states used the same lie about med school, it didn't seem likely. 

I also have Type 1 diabetes and have no family history at all. Every doctor I've had tells me how unlucky I am because it is usually in the family tree and my chances of getting it were very low. 

I'm currently looking at my ""half brothers"" pictures and he looks just like my dad but nothing like my sister and I. Not even close. 

My mom has had a migraine throwing up the past 2 days since discussing this but I assumed it was a coincidence, now I'm thinking nerves. 

I'm going to talk to my mom today and if I get the answer I think I will, I'm going to message my new half sisters apologizing for showing them their Dad because he's actually none of our Dads. 

Pretty sweet my Dad might be a Doctor and not a raging alcoholic though, so that's cool. 



TL;DR I felt bad my 4 new half sisters didn't know their father but as it turns out, none of us know our father. 

UPDATE: My mom admitted it! WE ARE IVF BABIES! I texted my half sisters this morning to let them know. This will be a great party story. 

UPDATE 2: I and my half sisters claim any and all movie rights to this and do not approve any unauthorized use of this story. Be cool, thanks guys! /s since some people can't understand this was tongue in cheek.

AITA for not telling my husband that I know his secret,"My husband and I have been married for almost two decades. We have a daughter who is my favorite person on this earth. She is so fantastic. She will be starting her senior year of high school and is preparing to apply for colleges.

I was contacted recently by another woman, who informed me that my husband had an affair with her, and when she found out about me, he arranged to pay child support for their child under the table so that I wouldn't find out. She sent me a number of documents recording bank transfers, which I was able to match to transfers from our accounts, as well as photos of my husband with their child through the years. She also provided the dates of his visits to her, which line up with several of his business trips. 

I was totally devastated and took the time to think it over and verify everything before I confronted my husband. I have decided that I am going to wait a year until I tell him that I know and file for divorce. It will be a terrible year for me but I know I can fake it since he's traveling for work a lot anyway. I have decided to do this for several reasons:

1. Our daughter will be applying to college soon and will be starting a really important year. I don't want to blow her life up with a divorce and the bombshell that her father was unfaithful and now she has a sibling that neither of us knew about. 
2. My husband has many more financial resources than I do. I am well aware that if I file for divorce while our daughter still lives at home, he will leave me to care for her and will make me fight tooth and nail for monetary support and will likely drain me with legal fees, as he tends to be litigious. I make enough to support myself comfortably, but not enough to comfortably support myself and my daughter.
3. I fear that opening this door will open others. That is, I worry that he may have other children that I don't know about, which would only magnify the hurt for both me and my daughter, and I don't think that now is the time to handle it.

My question is, does my plan make me an asshole? I feel slimy not telling him right now and faking my affection for him, but I fear for my daughter's wellbeing and my own ability to support us. AITA?

Just found out that my [25M] fiancee [25F] has been bullying my best friend of 20+ years [26F].,"Hi all.

I've been together with Hollie for three years and I proposed to her last summer, with a date set for springtime next year. She's an investment banker and the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. We met on a night out. We moved in together after a year in an apartment that her parents are paying for. I thought Hollie was ''the one'' from our first date, but now I'm not so sure. 

I'm best friends with a girl called Sarah. We've known each other since we were little kids (grew up on the same street, parents knew each other, etc). I had a crush on Sarah when we were kids and had feelings for her throughout our teenage years, and she claimed to feel the same, but over the years we both dated different people or had other things going on in our lives. 

When I introduced Hollie and Sarah, it was clear that they were two very different people, but whenever I'm around they've always been civil to each other. However, Sarah has told me that Hollie is always giving her dirty looks and disagreeing with everything she says just because. I never noticed the former but the latter has happened quite a few times. 

However, Sarah confessed to me that whenever the two of them are alone together, Hollie is actively cruel to her. Making comments about her appearance, her background, her family, etc. I did not believe this and actually distanced myself from Sarah to protect my relationship with Hollie (who has been telling me to get rid of Sarah when I told her what Sarah had accused her of. 

I've not been that close to Sarah lately because of this, however, some of my friends got together at my best friend's house last night. Sarah was there and I brought Hollie along. For some reason Sarah left early and Hollie was really upset about something. She started crying when we got home but didn't tell me what was wrong. 

Early in the morning when Hollie was asleep I got a whatsapp voice message from Sarah which was 20 minutes long. It was a conversation between Sarah and Hollie which must have been taken yesterday. It started off OK, but Hollie started to speak more unpleasantly for no reason at all. She accused Sarah of ''hanging around like a bad smell'' and asked why anyone would choose Sarah over her. Hollie called Sarah ugly and called her family ''scum'' and mocked her job (Sarah is an elderly care assistant). She also told her that she'd make sure I'd want nothing to do with Sarah. At this point Sarah told her that she was recording all of this on her phone and would show it to me. Hollie can be heard sobbing and begging her not to save the recording. Sarah then said goodbye to her and Hollie can be heard shouting ''You f#cking b****!''

After listening to this I was not sure what to do so I pretneded everything was normal. I made Hollie breakfast like I always do. She's doing some shopping with her mom so she left in the morning and will be back late. 

I'm not sure what to do. I thought Hollie was everything I'd ever wanted. She was perfect. But now I'm fairly sure that everything Sarah has accused her of is true. The things she said to Sarah on the recording were disgusting and nothing like the nice girl I fell in love with. I haven't spoke to Sarah yet, because I'm struggling to find the words to apologise for not believing her. 

I'm not sure if I can continue my relationship with Hollie. Sarah was my whole world once, and even now I still care deeply for her. To know that my future wife wants - and is actively trying to - get rid of her is frightening. But at the same time I was so sure that Hollie was who I was meant to be with and I'm not sure I have it in me to break her heart. 

Should I break up with Hollie or try to salvage something with her, and how to I go about building bridges with Sarah?

"Neighbor's kid got hurt jumping over my fence. My fence is in good order and so is the grass beneath it, the jump itself is what hurt him. Father is irate. Need specifics on what to do.","I woke up at 5AM this morning to screaming. My neighbor's son, who is 13, tried to get over my 8 foot privacy fence. He used a ladder on the outside of the fence and then jumped the 8 feet down. He landed badly and broke his leg.

His leg was visibly broken so I called an ambulance. I asked him to tell me his parents' phone number so I could call them but he refused to give it and I didn't want to leave him alone in my yard with a broken leg so I waited until they arrived. A police car showed up first and they did not want me to leave so one officer went to get his parents and the other stayed with us. The parents got over just as he was being put in the ambulance out front and the first officer was writing down what happened with me out back. His parents went in the ambulance with him and the police told me they would contact me if they needed anymore information. So I never spoke directly with the parents.

The receptionist at my workplace said that he showed up looking for me this morning just after 8. She said he was visibly angry, swearing and implying that she was ""hiding"" me from him (I was just not there). He identified himself by name and told her to send me the message that I should man up and find him before he finds me. They said he also specifically brought up that he went to my house and I have locked my gate, so he can't get in to see where his son fell.  They will be calling the police if he comes back.

I am hoping for answers about the following questions that I have.

1. Based on the account from work, the father seemed extremely angry, even for the circumstances, and even a vague threat is still worrisome. I was planning to talk to the police this afternoon and inform them of what happened at my workplace. Unless there is any reason I should not do that?

2.  I am intending to contact my homeowners insurance this afternoon and alert them to the situation. Also want to confirm that's the right move.

3.  As I said he specifically brought up the fact that when I left my house after all this, I locked the gate. There was not a special reason for this, I just keep it locked all the time and saw no reason not to, the police had not mentioned anything about coming back for any reason. If the child's father does want to look inside my yard at the area where he fell, should I let him, or should I not? And on that note, should I talk to him in general or should I be going straight to have everything go through a lawyer?

Thank you for any input you might have. I think there's a firm grip on this, I just want to make sure my plan is right and I'm not setting myself up for anything here.

TIFU when using the shower head to masturbate,"Alrighty it's now the morning after;  I am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won't stop laughing at me. 

Last night hubby & I had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. 

As usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. One of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉

As a 35 year old woman I had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. Sure, I have toys (I'm no prude) but I had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

The night ended and we went home. Smelling of the bonfire I tell hubby I'm having a shower & he says he doesn't care, he's going to bed. 

I should admit I was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an Uber in case anyone's concerned we drove under the influence). 

I'm washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. Ok, imma try the shower head... 

Ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

Ok feels better but I could still use more pressure.. 

Ohh ok that's just right. Yeah that's the spot... oh YEAH THAT'S THE SPOT!!!!! 

...Screaming: Ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

Just as I was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. I slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as I managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

Hubby came running in and I'm telling you it was a fucking sight. 

I'm planked from the shower across the toilet (In like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while I'm crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

I fucked up y'all. 

It takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that's ever happened. 

I managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. Lucky.

Anyway we went to the ED because I did have a few decent cuts but I only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. Again, lucky. 

I told the nurse & doctor that I slipped while cleaning the shower. You know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

I'll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

TL;DR went to town on myself with the shower head, as I orgasmed I slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ED for a few stitches.

Edit: changed the TLDR for u/Nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate

Edit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. Thanks for the awards too. 

To answer the biggest question: I was embarrassed and panicked when I said I was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying I slipped. Stupid I know, but none of us are perfect. 

To all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can't so you've got that 😂

To the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think I'm a man, who slid into my DMs just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. I'm not responding to anyone who attacks me, it's pretty sad you've got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it's just not needed. 

I've also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and I've learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you!",tifu

UPDATE AITA for following my [42M] wife [27F] around for an evening?,"Here is a link to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita\_for\_following\_my\_42m\_wife\_27f\_around\_for\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita_for_following_my_42m_wife_27f_around_for_an/).

If you don't want to read it, here's the summary...I believed my wife to be having an affair with a coworker who had repeatedly appeared in her pictures and conversations. So, one happy hour, I followed her. Even though I had seen nothing definitive, I confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.

Believe it or not, I listened to your advice. I received extensive advice from both sides. Publicly, everyone agreed I was at fault. In my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. Regardless, I sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, Brandon. I told her I did not feel as attractive as Brandon and worried that as I was getting older, her interest in me was waning. I also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. I apologized for following her and told her I would never do it again.

She told me several things. First, that she was offended I did not trust her. Second, that she did suspect Brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. Third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. The thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.

She also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. She reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.

So, what of our future? I asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after I had followed her. She joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. She told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (Java, specifically). I haven't told her yet, but I plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the Maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that I never heard of until researching...

TL;DR - My wife and I are back on track. Thank you, genuinely.

It just really annoys the shit out of me. Like I may like guns, BUT at least I respect anyone calling for action against guns. That's action. You're voicing a stance, and that's good. 

You saying ""omg, I'm literally shaking"" is just fucking worthless reaction to tell anyone. 

Get a grip.

Edit: So far I have been DMed and called a ""cunt"" and a ""dumpster faggot""
Very classy. You're mad about me saying anything about these attacks, but you realize the recent Orlando attack was a gay nightclub, right? Is that irony lost on you when calling me a ""faggot""? 

Otherwise, thank you for the mostly civil discussion, even if you really disagree with me. Only a few people grossly misunderstood me. I also do have empathy for innocent people getting slaughtered minding their own business, but I don't have room for people seeking attention over something that has little to do with them.

Also shoutout to those people dropping peer reviewed statistics on all of this.

Edit 2: I've had 2 people DM me hoping I one day get empathy lol. How do you go outside everyday without having an emotional breakdown? Good god haha.

Edit 3: One more DM telling me to kill myself. Oof.

Edit 4: 5 days later, and still getting harassed with DMs. Had a friendly guy call me a ""fucking retard who deserves to eat shit and die"" and kindly said ""Glad Karma catched up with you and you default on your loans."" Someone made a burner account to tell me to die, yet I ""don't have empathy"" and I'm the ""psycho""? The irony is so thick, I could scoop it up and spread it on a peice of bread. Also, hypothetically speaking, what if I was a nutbar with no empathy and ready to go off. Wouldn't harassing me with nasty messages just confirm my delusional bias with society at large? Oh wait, that's right, the people harassing me are too fucking stupid to process any of that.",unpopularopinion
TIFU with a jug of tea and a jug of ancient spit/urine,"TIFU, To begin my harrowing tale you must know I spend anywhere from 3 to 5 days a week in a pickup running around several western states doing my job as a heavy construction company consultant. These days are usually a minimum of 6 hours on the road, but usually are more like 8-10.

When you're spending these kind of hours on the road with tight deadlines and appointments that have to be met, you find shortcuts and time savers. One of mine is mastering the art of pissing in a jug.

On top of this I chew tobacco religiously, usually one or two tins of the stuff a day. That being said when you have a full bottle of spit, it's much nicer to pour it in the piss jug than it is to pour it out the window and end up with redneck racing stripes down the side.

Usually these jugs get tossed after a day, 2 tops but sometimes stuff just slips through the cracks. This was one of those times.

Today I used my extra personal vehicle for work, company truck was in the shop and no way I'm taking a nice rig on some of the roads my line of work takes me. It has been around 8 months since I used this vehicle last, and in a perfectly sized little cubby behind the passenger seat there is a shelf just right to hold a gallon jug.

Fast forward to tonight, and I'm just driving back from a really shitty day. Windows down, Foghat blaring, I reach behind the seat to grab my gallon of sweet tea, spin the lid off, and take a gulp.

I literally almost died.

The putridity of this concoction could not be replicated in a CIA biological weapons lab. It was exactly how you'd expect 8 month old urine and dip spit left in a hot truck cab would smell and taste, but worse. Oh so much worse. A chunk from a strange gelatinous skin that had formed on the surface bounced in my mouth and into my throat. The projectile vomit that ensued immediately caused me to fully stomp the breaks taking a 1 ton truck from 65 to a dead stop in what has to be record time. I smashed the grill and took out 2 linear posts jerking onto the road shoulder.

That wasn't nearly the worst damage.

My sudden vomit and violent breaking caused the jug to go flying into the dashboard, smashing and spraying a geyser of this unspeakably evil fluid all over me and the interior of the truck.

It was physically undriveable. Years on a farm gave me a strong stomach, but this was impossible. Period. The smell from my clothes made me retch uncontrollably, and it took a solid 20 minutes of stripping and puking by the roadside until I was able to control it long enough to get a pair of overalls from my trailer, even still my skin that had been exposed to the biohazard had an oily stench that remained.

I unhooked the trailer, called our wrecker, and had them tow it to the shop. The wrecker driver drove us back without a word, though albeit a green face and the windows fully rolled down in 45 degrees drizzly weather.

I sprayed out the interior of the truck with a pressure washer, but I fear even that isn't enough to remove the permanent, permeating soiling the truck received. I'm 4 showers in and there is still remaining smell on my body. I'm beginning to believe this is a job more suited for a priest than hot water. As for the clothes I was wearing? They're getting about 3 gallons of diesel and a match tomorrow morning. There is nothing salvageable there. Nothing.

TL;DR drank ancient piss and tobacco spit, almost died and witnessed firsthand the worst smell ever to grace the face of this earth.",tifu

"UPDATE to ""He's(25) falling out of love and I(25f) don't know what to do"": Why he avoided me.","[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b17a0h/hes25_falling_out_of_love_and_i25f_dont_know_what/)

What happened after I made the post: I wrote him a letter, hinting that this relationship won't work if it continues like this. I also printed the post I had made and the comments I got. I thought maybe it helps if he sees it from a different perspective. I put the letter and what I printed on the bed, together with a photo book of an amazing vacation we had. I then removed the SIM card from my phone, a), because I didn't want to communicate with him until he read what I had left on the bed, and b), because the phone was actually his old one as my actual phone had been sent in to be repaired, and had now arrived at my parents', and that's were I wanted to spend the weekend. Then I picked up all our pets, and left for my home town (I always take them with me when I visit my parents).

Apparently, he came home early from work, only about an hour after I had left, to a deserted apartment. When I put the SIM card back into the repaired phone about 7 hours later, he had left a few messages, saying that he had read what I had written and printed out, thought a lot about all this, he had looked through the photo book, and had a conversation with a friend. That friend is almost twice as old as we are, used to be his drinking buddy and is sort of a father figure for my boyfriend. He said that this friend had gone through the same situation with his wife. Apparently, he had been so stressed out by his job going downhill, he tried to safe it by working longer hours, which sometimes created some tension between his wife and him, so he avoided her by going out for drinks every night, creating a vicious cycle of her being unhappy about not seeing him and him avoiding her even more.

But he had found a solution. He realised that his job shouldn't define his life. He made a list of goals he wants to tick off each week. His marriage has apparently been going very well since then (it's the reason why I said he used to be my boyfriend's drinking buddy!).

My boyfriend said it dawned on him. He's in the same situation. He's putting in as much effort as the CEO who doesn't even appreciate his work. He doesn't want to lose me, I'm the best thing that has ever come to his life. He apparently cried a lot and made his own list of goals he wants to tick off each week. When I came back Sunday night, I found it on our fridge. It has very specific goals about him working less overtime and making up for the lost time by taking time off, spontanously going out only once a week max with his drinking buddies, and spending time with me doing real activities at least twice a week.

Since then, our dynamic has changed entirely. We had sex. We cuddled. We talked. He was there. Now it's only been 6 days since I made the post, but I hope it stays this great between us. I guess the realisations he had could help with him keeping up his new goal habits.

Weirdly, all the talks we had before when I told him I was unhappy because we didn't see each other much probably contributed to him avoiding me even more after already being stressed from work. This ""talk"" was different, because it made him realise that he'd lose me if it continued like this, and because it made him reach out to his friend. Maybe the deserted apartment contributed as well, because it was a little taste into life without me.

TL;DR: I probably owe my boyfriend's friend big time.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] Had a falling out with the girl I love and got served a cease and desist order. What can I legally do? [Michigan] (x-post on r/relationships),"Past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

Oh boy. I've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn't going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",legaladvice

"Apartment complex installed ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. What are my options? [Colorado]","I got a notice via email a while back that the Apartment complex where I live in Denver was going to be installing ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment. I didn't respond because I assumed I would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  I was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while I was traveling for work. 

Now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying I requested this and asking that I consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, I am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if I do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

Some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""You have requested that we provide [Insert Name of SmartDevice Vendor] in your unit. We agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

I did not request this.

`""Information collected by [Insert Name of SmartDevice Venor] (""Information""): We have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""Personal Information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. Front Door Lock:- Entry activity by time and code used- Technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

This language is pretty much the same for Thermostat, SmartPlugs and Switches, Hub, Water Sensor and software to use it all.

`""Information Sharing: Anonymized and aggregated information collected by the Service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. Recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

Additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if I lose or damage any of them, I am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""If a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

What are my options? I really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but I also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that I did not want or consent to being installed.

"AITA for dropping the ""We're Not Having Kids, Now Stop Bringing It Up"" bomb on my MIL?"," My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.

So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""

MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.

MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.

After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""

Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.

My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",AmItheAsshole

After the officer told me I could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. Guy told him I sped up and that I was ""mad he was passing me."" Said Officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. I didn't even think he actually got it) and saw that I already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. So. The officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

My parents are furious and we're just waiting for my day in court because there's no evidence I sped up, there's no dash cam footage that's mysteriously came up, there's nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



Hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (I have a speeding ticket but I did my time for it). I was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it's been rainy for a few weeks and I'm also just still paranoid since my first ticket. Two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

Cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. I guess he didn't look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. I swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. The first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

I moved on from it since I didn't cause the accident and I went on to school. Yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying I was being faulted for an accident and that this guy's insurance was coming after me. I was so confused because my car wasn't damaged, I don't need this on my driving record, and so on. My stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because I was supposed to slow down when I saw him passing. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do here. Is this a situation where I can tell him to pound sand or should I take it seriously? 

Edit: My stepdad called juvie court today and asked what I was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene I spoke to (I told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. He asked to see my license. I didn't see why not. He basically said ""Thanks for reporting I'll contact you if I need anything else have a good day"") is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. And the reason he let me go then was because he ""didn't know I could've prevented the accident until further investigation.""

We're even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we'd all just have to wait. I'm guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him I sped up or something. I don't know what to do here because if this sticks, I lose my license until I turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket). ",legaladvice
[UPDATE] I (29F) found a bra under our bed. It isn't mine.,"Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ashm38/i_29f_found_a_bra_under_our_bed_it_isnt_mine/

Hello again everyone. I just wanted to say thank you to those of you who gave advice and support about my situation, and I just wanted to provide an update to let everyone know how it went.

For those who just wanna cut right to the chase; THE BRA WAS HIS!

I decided that the best course of action would be to confront him about it when he got home. I told him I needed to talk with him, and when we sat down I threw the bra on the table and told him to explain what the hell was going on. His immediate reaction was of guilt, and he didn't say anything for a while. This set me off because I was already stressed out and I began to cry, and yelled at him to tell me why he was fucking another woman.

He said that he wasn't cheating on me, and he hoped that it never came out, but he said the bra was his. He said that he likes to wear it sometimes and it must have ended up under the bed and he forgot to hide it. I was still crying and I told him that he was full of shit and I couldn't believe his excuse.

We sat in silence for a while before he eventually asked me to come with him. He took me into the spare bedroom and dug through the storage closet and pulled out a locked suitcase. Inside the suitcase was all of his crossdressing stuff; bras, underwear, stockings, dresses, etc. He even had the panties to match the bra to prove he was telling the truth.

I was honestly shocked and pretty blown away. I didn't really know how to react. He told me that he had been dressing up for many years, but it was purely sexual and no other reason. He said he didn't want to tell me because he didn't want to scare me away and lose me. He said he would get rid of it all.

I was still pretty speechless and couldn't say much about it. I didn't really know how to process it at first. We didn't really speak much about it that day, or much at all for the rest of the day either. I told him I just needed a bit of time to process it all. I asked him to sleep in the other room that night.

Upon having time to think I calmed down a lot. I think the relief that he wasn't cheating on me really sank in. I figured that what he was doing, while very weird to me, was pretty harmless. The next day I told him I was sorry for accusing him of cheating. He said he was sorry for hiding it. We talked about it for a while. I told him that he if he wanted to keep dressing up I would support him, and if he ever wanted to bring it into our sex life I would be willing to give it a try. He seemed happy about this but needs to think it over a bit more in the future.

I feel bad that I didn't trust him, but it is relieving to know the truth. Once again I wanted to thank everyone who gave me advice. To those of you who suggested the bra was his, I'm sorry I disregarded your suggestion. You were right all along.

tl;dr: Confronted husband about cheating. Turns out he was into crossdressing.",relationship_advice
TIFU by accidentally committing theft as a Police Officer in full uniform.,"Poilce don't seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. This happened a few weeks ago.

I woke up one morning at 5:00 A.M. tired as fuck. I put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on TV or in a video game.

I started my normal routine: Got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best ""prepare for a police shift"" album of all time: ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST"". Now for my 15 minute commute to the city.

My vehicle was getting low on gas so I stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. I went in, put my Sausage, Egg, and Cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. Then I grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like I do as the beginning of every shift. After this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.

At about noon, I get a call from my Sergeant, who simply said ""I need to talk to you at the department.""

Oblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, I began heading to the police department. Millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. Upon my arrival, I was directed to my Lieutenant's office. When I walked in, I heard a stern, ""Close the door"". At this point I knew this wasn't good. I sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my Corporal. Sergeant, and Lieutenant.

After a preface from my Sergeant, he says, ""Tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.

I didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. ""Aaawww.......shit. I forgot to pay for my burrito."" Then I just heard ""Guess what, that's theft.""

After a ""Come to Jesus"" moment with my superiors, I left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. They didn't want to press charges.

Although nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is I can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. All they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. 

On a lighter tone, Now other officers have nicknamed me ""The Burrito Burglar"" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when I see them.

Tl;dr: I'm a police officer. Walked into a gas station I go into every morning and, being in ""autopilot"" mode, I walked out with the same burrito I get every morning, and forgot to pay for it.",tifu

Jokingly, I responded, ""They have a list for all the students that throw themselves off the church tower, right? Look for my name there!""
Most of us have a dark sense of humour in our field, and my tutor was no exception. She laughed with me, then frowned. 
""You know I have to report you for saying that..""
I thought she was joking, and laughed again.

"LPT: When petting a dog that is overly submissive, pet/rub their chests not their heads. This will boost their confidence.","Firstly you should never pet a scared dog, especially if you don't know it.

My wife and I foster shelter dogs that are about to be euthanized and train them for CGC certification then adopt them into loving homes. One of the common problems we see are from a dog that was most likely previously abused is that it doesn't know if you are going to hit it or pet it. Petting/rubbing their chest is a submissive gesture that almost instantly conveys that you are not going to harm the dog and that you are indeed praising it. This works for two reasons. One you are forfeiting the high ground by using a non dominating approach and two that is an approach that most likely has never resulted in punishment/pain.

Edit: Thank you for all the kind words. I was honestly hesitant to post this because of how scrutinizing reddit can be. I hope this will be able to help someone and their pup.

My (22f) coworker (40+m) bought me flowers for my wedding. How do I thank him?,"I work in an office setting and I rarely interact with my coworkers. My job involves a lot of time-consuming, individual work so I have almost no time to bond. Somehow, one of my coworkers got wind that I was getting married soon.

He caught me when I was walking to my car after work and asked for my opinion on floral arrangements. I, being an idiot, gave my opinion and didn't connect the dots until he said ""Do you have flowers for your wedding?"". When I protested he said ""I've already ordered them, I'll send them to your house the day before the wedding. This is my wedding gift to you."" He said something else about how it's important to him that I start my marriage off on the right foot and he walked away.

I drove home in tears. When I told my fiancé he was in disbelief. I don't know what I did to deserve such kindness.

I'm so touched that he went out of his way for me. I want to thank him but I don't know how?? A wedding thank you card seems like it's not enough and giving him money seems disrespectful?? Help.

&#x200B;

Edit : My coworker and I are from a culture where the bride + groom are expected to wear floral accessories during the ceremony. I didn't have this as I'm a broke baby and my fiancé isn't part of my culture. I was planning to do a more westernized ceremony and yes, it did make me sad that I wasn't going to be getting married the way I wanted. I don't know how my coworker figured out that I didn't have these accessories yet but he did.

Edit #2 : Wow so many nice people!!! Thank you to everyone for the congratulations!! I'm excited to celebrate my union the way I originally wanted to thanks to this nice man (whom I will thank properly).

Update: I reached out and invited him to the wedding. Unfortunately, he and his wife can't make it but he appreciated me asking.

TIFU by taking my wife up the world's steepest street...,"My wife and I were having a holiday in New Zealand's South Island, and visited Dunedin. I've been there a number of times and casually asked my wife: 

""Have you ever been to the world's steepest street?""

""No."" says she

""Would you be interested in having a look?"" says I

""I dunno"" says she, in the often used tone of a woman that clearly means No, but with words softer than a blunt refusal.

Being the loving husband I am, knowing full well how much she hates heights, I take her words as enthusiastic consent. She gave in and decided to give it a try.

[Baldwin street in Dunedin is very steep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_Street). It doesn't look like it's too bad when your facing it, but as soon as you drive up it (or walk, if you're particularly adventurous), it quickly becomes quite intimidating. Some facts: they couldn't use ordinary roading materials because of how steep it is, and the footpath/sidewalk is one very long staircase - it's too dangerous to have it flat.

My wife quickly started to panic - but it was the sort of mid-level panic that me, as her husband, finds deeply amusing.

Anyway, we got to the top, and found a driveway to turn into so we could make the return journey facing down. I suggested reversing down and got punched.

Well, the mid-level panic quickly turned into full blown ""I hate you"" panic as the car lurched to the side as we turned to face the decent. The car was then pointing down at such an angle that you felt like it was impossible for the brakes to hold and that the car would simply fall uncontrollably. She had to cling onto the dashboard and everything else within reach to remain in her seat and she didn't trust her seat belt alone. 

We drove slowly down the street:

""TOO FAST""

""TOO FAST""

\*we came to a stop\*

""TOO FAST""

Her eyes were clamped shut in such a way that I was expecting a wonderful velcro-like tearing noise when she finally opened them.

After 17 lunar months the road leveled out and we parked up. My wife was hyperventilating and punching me at the same time. It took her quite a while to calm down.

After a few minutes I said ""Well that was fun, want to go again"".

I slept in the car that night.

&#x200B;

TL:DR - took wife up the world's steepest street, she had a panic attack and I became a victim of a woman's scorn. 

Edit: no, I didn't actually sleep in the car. Wife doesn't have anxiety issues. She later agreed that her reaction was funny and that she would have done the same to me had the situation arisen. Our marriage is such that we do things like this to each other and get a laugh out of each other's reactions. I know where the line is for her and she with me.

AITA for planning on only getting one of my kids Christmas gifts?,"Throwaway because some of my church friends know my main account. 

Backstory: My husband and I have two kids (both teenagers). We raised our children to be Christian (as is our faith), but also didn't want to force them into our religion so as soon as they turned 13 they were allowed to no longer come to church, participate in saying grace before meals, etc.. One of our kids has continued with church and their faith very adamantly. Our other kid has come to church more sporadically and over the past half year or so has began to explore Buddhism. More recently they have been telling us that they are no longer Christian, but they are Buddhists. While we are disappointed that they are no longer Christian, I  believe everyone is entitled to their own religion and I am proud that my daughter is exploring her faith. 

Current Issue: At dinner recently we were talking about travel plans for Christmas (we usually will rent a cabin somewhere for family time) and I mentioned that I wasn't planning to get our non-Christian daughter any big gifts since her religion doesn't celebrate Christmas. She was immediately upset. I told her that I would get her some little goodies so she didn't feel too left out, but that she shouldn't expect to partake in a religious holiday for a religion she doesn't believe in. She said (I'm so many words) it's not fair for us to spend money on our other child's gifts, but not her and that we were punishing her for not being Christian. It doesn't make sense to me to give her gifts to celebrate the birth of Jesus when she doesn't believe he is our savior. I told her if she really felt it were unfair, I would donate the amount of money I spent on our other kid to a charity of her choice in her name. She didn't like this either. My husband and I have since talked and he has very mixed feelings on the whole situation. 

AITA?

Edited to add: not sure if this matters, but I have made it clear to her that if she ever wanted to celebrate any holidays pertaining to her religion I would do my best and get her what she needs to celebrate. My goal is not to hinder her exploration of Buddhism.

Edited to add: I see a lot of comments about how Christmas isn't a Christian holiday and I agree that many families celebrate a very commercialized Christmas. We (for example) do not involve Santa in our celebration, but we do (for example) read from the Bible and sing Hymns. Regardless of what others do, our family takes the holiday as an opportunity to celebrate and thank God for all that he has done and provided for us.

Final Edit (Hopefully): I hear you all and I know I have a lot of reflection ahead of me. Even though some of this is hard to read, I really do appreciate you all taking the time to respond. I think my family has a lot of discussion ahead of us and I specifically have some growth to do as a mother and Christian. I also want to let those of you who have voiced concerns know that both of my children are loved by my husband and myself and that I plan on talking with my daughter (maybe even showing her this thread) about how I can do better by her.",AmItheAsshole

So, we had a talk, and she still denies there is anything going on between them. I've said that I will not be a safety net, and that she has to choose. Does not look like she chose me. She didn't want to leave me, but she didn't want to cut him completely out of her life. She wouldn't even commit to telling him in front of me that they should keep it purely professional. She said that she had so many friends there and spouted some BS that she could only work there. So looks like I will have to get my ducks in a row. But thanks for all the helpful advice.

He has an ex wife who he has admitted still wants him.  They had 3 children together and of course need to co parent these children.

Woke me up 1 hour before he was to take this trip and advised that there had been a change in plans and now he and ex wife were travelling together this long distance trip and they were staying all together in a hotel room because his ex wife had suggested it to him the day before and he felt it was a good idea.  Then just asked me if i was uncomfortable with that and left to take his daughter to school.  Upon his return,  his other children were there, so unwilling to discuss anything in front of them.

Story goes like this. Location: Canada. I'm a British Columbia resident and got arrested in Ontario.

August 2016 I was arrested for stunt driving/excessive speeding. 

In aug 2017 I was given a conditional discharge and was put on a 1 year probation, prohibiting me from operating a motor vehicle and my license was suspended. During the probation period I didn't Drive or in anyway operated any motor vehicle.

August 2018 I've completed my driving prohibition and probation. I reacquired my drivers license.

Fast forward to 19th May 2019, while driving I was pulled over and arrested for violating probation. My car is going to be impounded for 7 days, and my license is taken away from me. What does that even mean? I haven't gotten into any trouble or received any letter about this. I'm genuinely confused and anxious. As my main Job was being a delivery driver (like skipthedishes) this affects me in a big way. I've been on my nerves since I couldn't get any help until the long weekend is over.

[UPDATE] 21st May 2019

I've been to the Vancouver provincial court where my original offence was transferred to for some answers and apparently on their side I'm cleared from probation and the driving prohibition. I was also told to go check with my local court since my new charge was sent there. Also applied for legal aid here.

I've been to my local court to ask about the new charge (18th May) and too see if they could help me clarify what is going on and they couldn't really help me. They say they would need the new charge to come to the court in order to make a clarification and apparently the file is still in transit and I should contact the transit police. 

Then I've contacted the transit police and they say I would need to wait until my court date in August then the court will have the file. 

I got an appointment for a lawyer coming up in the week hopefully he can help me.

AITA for demanding access to my fiance's bank accounts?,"Edit 1: Wow, thank you all so much for you input. I will post an update in a day or so

Edit 2: PLEASE STOP GIVING ME AWARDS THIS IS A THROWAWAY ACCOUNT. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE DANK MEMES

The title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

My fiance and I are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, Summer 2021.

I make pretty good money for my age. In fact, I make more money than any of my friends or family, and I would bet I'm in the ""1%"" of my community. I try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. I should also add when we started dating, I was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

My fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. She was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  Since then, she hasn't worked. I really didn't mind at all. I make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

I am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead I just would venmo her some cash weekly. It was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

She has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. I know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  She has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

I shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

I told her I would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so I could see exactly what she was spending it on. I could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but I hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

She blew up. Telling me I wasn't trusting her and how I was the one against joint bank accounts so I should understand her privacy. Yeah, HUGE red flags all over the place.

I talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying I was not respecting her privacy when I'm the one that demands it also.

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that "" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like ""I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.",relationship_advice

[Updated Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9xps88/update_on_im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how/)

I was going to make this an edit but due to its length, I figured to make it a separate post. I don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but I sincerely apologize if I am in the wrong.

I just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things I've mentioned in the comments briefly. I hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

But before I do that, I want to thank everyone who sent me a DM, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. I've read through all of them, but I haven't gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. You have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much I appreciate it. I love you all <3

# Quick update:

I texted Kyle yesterday and he replied. I asked him how he was feeling. He said he was even more sick than earlier. I said I was too, and I said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). I told him about how I had a volunteer thing at University which I went to and how I nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. But that was it. We didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

In addition to this, I haven't called the number my TA gave me because they are only open Monday - Friday from 8am to 4pm. So, I'm going to be doing that on Monday, hopefully.

# My condition:

The exact name for my condition is Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome, or MRKH Syndrome for short. It affects 1 in every 5000 women. A lot of people, I'm assuming they were trolls, stated that I was a guy or something along those line. Just to clarify, I am a woman, I look like a woman physically and I've felt like a woman my whole life. I was genetically born with XX chromosomes. Being a woman is not something I doubt.

There are basically 2 types of branches within MRKH. Type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. Type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. This may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. I have type 1. There are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. I am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# Diagnosis:

A lot of people were confused as to why I was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did I find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

The way MKRH works is that it affects INTERNAL reproductive organs. This means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. From the outside, I look like a normal female. I have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. I am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. My ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why I am still physically able to look like a female. For me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, I have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. For 18 years of my life, I lived thinking I was just like any other girl. I never once suspected anything wrong.

When I started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. But this was around the time I started to feel like something was wrong. One main reason was that I hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that I wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. For some reason, at the time, I assumed periods and fingering went together. I thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. Its weird looking back at that now haha.

I went to the doctors one day (this was before I started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. This is probably one of the most common ways women with MRKH find out about it. The doctors simply assumed that I was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. I was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. I was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. The following year, I got my shit together on my own. I joined the wrestling team, track team, and I started doing weight training. As a result of this, I was also eating way more, and I gained a lot of muscle mass. I got my weight up to 120lbs. when I still hadn't gotten my period, I went back to the doctors. They still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. I had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. I didn't feel like everything was normal, so I switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. Needless to say, I was getting tired of blood tests because I knew they didn't show anything. One doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but I think that was circumstantial. Prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that I had breast discharge which is something I had NEVER experienced before in my life. Some how, I can't exactly remember which doctor, I ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. I diligently took the BC pills every day. Nothing happened. This is when I thought, ""Is it just me or does healthcare in Canada suck?"".

Then another doctor suggested I get a pelvic ultrasound done. This is when they found the issue. The poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. The doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. She stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom I had MRKH. She said according to the ultrasound I had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). She literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. I walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. His response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and I could hear him. And then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". I came home, and I did some googling and started to learn more about MRKH. I had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and I texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. I also added that if it changed anything between us, that I would understand, and I wouldn't hold it against him. As much as I might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something I really needed at the time.

After the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a SickKids Hospital in downtown Toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. They started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. They had me get an MRI done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an MRI. I also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). Doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. I ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because I didn't have one. The look on their face was hilarious as I'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. After I met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, I was properly informed that I did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but I was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. I was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. They had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a Q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. The depth of it was about 3mm deep. It was actually quite painful, and I hated doctors by this point anyways.

# Family Situation:

My parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are HIGHLY taboo. Everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know English well so most of the time when I went to the doctors, I went with my dad. It was very weird and awkward. The few times my dad refused to go with me, I went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

After my last appointment with SickKids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. My dad took those from me and threw them out, saying I didn't need them. They also asked if I would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that I didn't it. Going to therapy at the Hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. I can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. Taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which I don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but I don't have time due to school. I actually got a letter from the hospital in September about a pretty cool MRKH conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. I really really wanted to go. But again, it was far. I figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, I could definitely bus there. The event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. It was unrealistic for me to go. So then I told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. They'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" I tried arguing that it was EXACTLY the opposite of that, and that they WANT to inform you that you ARE women despite the lack of certain organs. They responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) I had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

I had someone telling me that I need to stand up to my parents. My parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances that I don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something I refuse to do. I am well aware of the shitty situation I am in. I know they are being abusive, in more than one way. I've thought long and hard about it, and I've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. I'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. I've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# Surgery:

I had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. In my first post, somewhere in the comments, I believe I said something along the lines of ""Im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why I can't get surgery yet. Lucky for me, I live in Canada and I have health insurance! Surgery is definitely an option for me. But due to my family situation, they believe that I wont need surgery until after I get married because I mean its not like I'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# Additional comments:

1. A lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that I could look into doing anal. It's all about personal preference, and I hate it. Its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. I can look into the asexual community, but I am NOT asexual. I may not be able to satisfy my needs, but I do have a pretty high sex drive, and I do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. I don't know if I would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. A lot of people had a lot to say about how I handled the situation. Some saying I did the right thing, and others saying I did it too soon. Honestly, I haven't figured out the right way to go about it. I have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. I once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""Aren't you surprised I still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" I was so taken aback by it, I didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. Someone said that ""If a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, I'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. So he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". True, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his IBS. I didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was RELEVANT to what was happening. I evaluated the situation I was in with Kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so I had to tell him. Agree or not, first date material or not, I'm going to stand by with what I did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. I am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. Its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest I do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. I don't want to publicly display it to guys I'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. I know guys who also use those dating apps, and I don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. The guy I ended up calling on Tuesday night, after I left Kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. He has told me that it wouldn't bother him. I had a lot of messages telling me that I shouldn't friend-zone him, and that I should give him a chance. Here is the real reason why I'm not attracted him nor why I would never ever give him a chance: He's basically doing nothing with his life. He's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. Whereas I on the other hand, I work part-time, I study my ass off in school, and I make time to do extra curricular stuff. I also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. But I treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. I'm not saying I'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am I saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. I'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and I'm not into that. In addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. He was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". I was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, I am. There is no way I am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. I think one of the main reasons I even turned to reddit in the first place was because I am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. Social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and I don't want them finding out. There was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me I can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications I got.

This is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. I hope I answered some questions. I really do appreciate all the support I got. Thank you, and take care everyone <3

Edit: I'm only doing this to feel better about myself: Kyle replied. ""I definitely do not want to get involved"". Fuck you, Kyle. If y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. I welcome it with open arms. 

Edit: I think I forgot to address this earlier. For those of you asking whether I can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. My clitoris is underdeveloped. Stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. Maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? I don't know. I haven't tried.

I think my (22M) girlfriend (20F) might be cheating on me with my roommate.,"My girlfriend and I have been together since high school. We go to the same college, and she basically lives me. We live in a 4 bedroom apartment with three others guys.

My roommates and I hang out a lot with my girlfriend, but she gets along especially well with one, we'll call him....Chet.

Chet is really close with my girlfriend. When I go to sleep (I go to bed really early), she goes and hangs out in his room. When I ask her about it, she tells me what good friends they are, and goes into detail about how she just could never even imagine his lips touching hers, that it makes her sick to think about. Part of me believes me, but part of me wonders why she goes into such detail about how repulsed she is by this idea.

Recently, they got into a fight because his girlfriend doesn't like my girlfriend. This fight ended in him buying her her favorite snacks and leaving them on our bed.

This seems like way intimate to be just a friendship to me, but I'm afraid to flat out ask her if they're sleeping together. I don't want to ruin our relationship over them just having a nice friendship. I don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments and encouragement. No, I did not set up a spy cam or try to walk in on them. 

I chickened out I think because I deep down didn't WANT to catch them in the act. Turns out I didn't need to.

I stayed quiet about it, which wasn't too hard because I was really busy with school this week anyway. Last night, my girlfriend told me we should throw a party at our apartment. I didn't really want to, but figured why the hell not, I could stand to get pretty drunk anyway. So last night we invited a ton of people over, which is not out of the ordinary for us, and my girlfriend invited her best friend. It started out as just a normal party, until Chet got raging drunk and announced to everyone that he had just broken up with his girlfriend of 3 years. So, I did something sort of manipulative that I'm not totally proud of.

I told my girlfriend's best friend, I'll call her Kim, that she should hook up with Chet. We had all been drinking a lot, and I sort of suspected she was down for Chet anyway, and she agreed enthusiastically. 

Cut to Chet sitting on our couch with Kim quite literally on top of him making out.

I pointed this out to my girlfriend, telling her it would be so great if our bestfriends dated eachother.

My girlfriend lost it. Like completely lost it. She started screaming and pushing Kim off of Chet, telling her she couldn't believe both of them would do that. She ended stopping the whole party because she made such a scene, and I just stood there and watched. When she finally snapped out of it and realized everyone was staring at her, I thanked her for confirming what I already knew, and told her to get the fuck out of my house.

That was last night. I'm still sort of in shock it went down like that. I went to bed right after, and haven't talked to anyone about it yet this morning. I don't really know how I can look Chet in the face after this, so I haven't left my room yet. ",relationship_advice

Vanilla Ice Cream is superior to Chocolate Ice Cream.,"Disclaimer: Vanilla ice cream isn't my favorite, (that's cookie dough) but it's way better than chocolate.

First of all, the taste of vanilla ice cream is much smoother and relaxed than chocolate. Nowadays, everyone says ""chocolate's"" they're favorite candy or treat, but vanilla has a better taste.

If it's a hot summer day and I have the choice between chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream, I'm going to go with vanilla because it has a more refreshing taste than chocolate.

Vanilla ice cream is also the basis for a lot of other flavors, like cookie dough, cookies and cream, etc.",unpopularopinion

[Ohio] Mom puts something in little brother's sippy cup. Told someone but they said its not abuse.

"Was I(25m) wrong for telling my wife (24f) ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you.""","First, some back story. Sorry, little bit of a long one. My wife(24f) and I(25m) have been married for almost two years, but have been together for over seven years. Shortly after we moved in together, about two years into our relationship, I learned my wife has an issue with getting these whiskers that grow on her chin. She told me it was because of a hormonal imbalance, but she was very good at plucking or waxing them so I wouldn't notice. She was very self conscious about them, so she tried to make sure they weren't present as often as possible. I completely understood that it was out of her control that it occurs, and I hardly even noticed because she kept on top of it so well.

Day one of when we started dating, she made it very clear to me that she hates beards on the men that she's with. She thinks they're very unattractive. Well, not on every guy. She likes beards on certain actors. But definitely not on me. So I have stayed clean shaven for her. If I even forget to shave, even for a couple days, she won't even kiss me because she hates the beard that much. She'll usually comment on it multiple times a day until I do shave. Progressively getting worse until I do the deed. But it's whatever, having to shave often doesn't bother me. I'm in the habit now of shaving every day or at least every other. If I could, I'd probably try to grow it out and see how I look with a legit beard, but my wife would definitely not allow it.

Back to the my wife's whiskers: since we've gotten married, my wife has gotten.. Comfortable. These whiskers of hers; she now goes weeks, even a month + without plucking them. After a whole month, these 5-10 whiskers are as long as the hair on my head (I have average length hair). Now, I love my wife to death, no matter what she looks like, I want that to be clear. But these whiskers: I'm not a fan of them. They're not soft, barely visible hairs, they're long, shiny, and resemble thick fishing line.

She gets on me about my appearance, especially my facial hair. After a month of her not taking care of her issue, I finally said in the most loving way I could ""Hey, babe, your whiskers are getting kinda long. Your coworkers might notice, maybe you should pluck them or something?"" She got quite offended. But, she took care of the problem. A few weeks go by, and once again, she let her whiskers get long. I make another suggestion that she should take care of them, this time, she completely shrugs me off. Says she's ""too tired and will do it later."" Keep in mind, she bought a handheld battery operated hair puller thing for this very purpose. It gets rid of the problem in under 20 seconds. I make a suggestion again a few days later, adding in very kindly that I love her, and don't much care how she looks, but I'm not a fan of them. Which again, she was offended, but took care of it. Now I'm stuck in this cycle of she let's it grow, I suggest to get rid of them, she ignores me, then I have to mention it more and more times before she does something about it. Always getting pissed off that I dare say something. It's at the point where if I don't say anything, she won't do it.

A few days ago. She was ripping me a new one because I wanted to have sex, but I haven't shaved my beard for a few days, and she didn't want to do anything since I was ""too scruffy."" It's been about three weeks since she's plucked her whiskers so they're at least an inch long. I snap and say ""this is bullshit, I shave almost every day for you. To look my best for you. But you won't get rid of those things on your chin once every couple weeks for me, even though I've kindly told you I don't like them."" and I finish with ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" Needless to say, she was incredibly pissed and we did not have sex that night. We're okay now. I've shaved since then. She has not.

Was I wrong to have said this? Was I wrong to look at this as a double standard? Should I have approached this differently?

* Update 1: some of you recommended laser hair removal or a similar permanent hair removal process. We have talked about laser hair removal in the past for her. She seemed interested, at first, but then made an excuse along the lines that she'd ""have to go back for multiple sessions and doesn't have the time for that."" I haven't tried to bring it up since.
* Update 2: some are asking if it's the look of the beard or the fact it's rough and scratchy she doesn't like. In this case, both. She says she doesn't like how I look with a beard. I've never had a beard while I've been with her, so how she came to that conclusion, I do not know. Hell, I don't even know what I look like with a legit beard. Earlier in the relationship, if I had stubble, and kiss her, she'd comment that it ""scratches and it's uncomfortable."" Which frankly, I understand. But then it evolved to her avoiding the kiss all together.
* Update 3: PCOS. Yes, she has it. She's known she's had it for a long time. I believe she was diagnosed with it before, or shortly after we first met. The hair growth probably is a side effect, and she has always handled it well. Up until recently.
* Update 4: everyone recommending I should post this in /r/AmItheAsshole. No can do. TIL that sub has a 3000 character limit. My post far exceeds that. Feel free to tell me if I'm the asshole here if you like.
* Update 5: thank you to those of you that have commented, or reached out to me, on different medications or procedures she could try that would help. I will definitely mention these to her. When the time is right of course. I appreciate you folks.
* Update 6: an **overwhelming** majority have suggested saying to her ""*I'll shave when you do.*"" That works for me. I'll definitely have an update to how that conversation goes.
* Update 7: ""*You shared this story with your guy friends!? You're a monster!*"" but sharing my story with thousands of strangers online is okay? Lol. I actually went into **far more** detail with you fine folks. I only shared this argument with two of my very close friends. And I only mentioned the bits about her getting on me about shaving my own beard. Not the personal bits about her. Not that I need to defend myself, but there you go.

Worlds fastest update - refused DNA test (CA),"While I was getting my ass handed to me in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. From what I hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, I don't think they actually took anyone's dna.


Many people pointed out that I sounded sketchy in my original post. That was probably true. I'm a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and I did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. I didn't know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so I thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things I never got caught for would come up. If I knew I was just being tested against a baby, I would have said sure.


I want to say that *because* of my past, I'm a squeaky clean employee- I never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an Advil from the med cart. We're not supposed to ever be alone with members, and I never am, even if I'm just dropping off a tray in someone's room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. I guess I was acting paranoid because I was pissed about being suspected when I've tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


Hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. I hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she's not here anymore, and I don't know what is happening). Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to let everyone know what was going on. 


**Edit:** I think the reason everyone was so mad at me in the original post was because I was acting like *I* was the victim, even though obviously that was not the case. That is some of that addict mentality, that I'm still working on with my sponsor.",legaladvice

My boyfriend is into butt stuff. I am /horrified/ by assholes.,"My(F21) boyfriend(M22) really gets off on having things in his ass, and it's slowly come to full swing over the course of our relationship. I hate assholes. They do nothing for me, i don't want to look at them, touch them, have mine looked at/touched. I don't like thinking they exist. Yeah, i know it's weird; no, it really probably isn't going to change. 
My other issue here is that I'm so proud of him for it. Like, he's come so far with being comfortable with his sexual desires and i am overjoyed seeing him doing so well for himself, especially since we're long distance. 
Occasionally I'll send him nudes if I'm up in the middle of the night because he likes waking up to them, but my other problem is that now I wake up to pictures of him really hard with toys up his ass. 
I don't want this. 
I never wanted this. 
Thinking about putting things in butts makes me want to vomit and i want nothing to do with it. But I'm also in the position of not wanting to tell him because i don't want him to feel ashamed or embarrassed. Please help me. 

Edit: thank you so much for the feedback everyone, you honestly don't know how much i appreciate it, and I'm happy i came here for advice. I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow and give an update when the time comes

[Ontario] Update 2 -- Feeder employee.,"So for those of you saying this wasn't over, I'm really unhappy to say you were right. At this point I really just WISH this was over, I'm so overwhelmed and drained. Writing it all out has really helped me out, and I know you guys like knowing the ending to stories so I hope no one minds another update. Again, thanks for all of your support during this. I do read everything in BOLA, I just don't reply unless I see people really confused about something.

Now onto the update.

Saturday Sarah's husband showed up at our building after dark, broke into the entrance way and was in the process of trying to break into our offices when the police showed up and arrested him. Thankfully the cleaner was in the upstairs hallway and heard him smash the lock on the door in order to get into the initial entrance way, then hid and called the cops.

According to the police he had a gasoline canister with him and they believe his intention was arson as retaliation for us firing Sarah. They wouldn't say much besides the base facts, however from what I gather (and also what the cleaner told me afterwards) he apparently flipped out when the cops showed up and was yelling incoherently.

The police called me and had me come into the station and relay my full story. It was awful and honestly really embarrassing. At this point they said there'll need to be an arraignment (which I won't be involved in) and then most likely a trial (which I may be required to be a part of) before we know what happens to him, but that they would update me as the case moves along when they can (like if he gets out on bail, etc).

The police are charging Sarah's husband with a handful of things (breaking and entering, attempted arson, apparently assaulting an officer and a few others) however my husband said we could probably recover the damages of the busted door as well. I also got together an emergency meeting for all the building / business owners and informed them of what had gone on (just the basics on Sarah's firing, not the details) and our business offered to hire a night time security guard for the next little while, which they agreed would be prudent. I feel really terrible about this now affecting them -- all of them could've lost their livelihoods. They were really nice about everything, but I can't help feeling like crap.

I sent all of this information off to our lawyer but haven't heard back from him as he's still on vacation.

We've still not heard anything from Sarah either, though all of her social media is gone (not blocked, we checked through an account she would have no reason to block) as well as her account on the website with the fetish photos. I honestly have no idea if she had anything to do with this or not.

So that's it. I'll see if I can update when everything is wrapped up (though some of you mentioned my lawyer may have me take these posts down), but if I'm able to it probably won't be for a while while the police and courts do their thing.",legaladvice
Update - the current owner wants us to pay for ac unit a year after selling house,"This is the update to this post:

I know only a handful of people will read this but I figured why not do an update. 

We were sued via small claims court for half of the amount of the AC unit. The case predictably was dismissed as we didn't misrepresent the condition of the 14 year old unit.  

What was interesting is that he genuinely thought that we owed him the money. Almost to the point of self righteousness. The way he talked about us; what he supposedly was told with nothing evidentiary to back up his claims. Additionally stating that his lawyer said that his case was strong. His lawyer didn't manage to show up to court but still very strong case. Oh well. It's over.

(UPDATE 2) My Roommate's (21F) Parents keep Letting Themselves into My (21F) Apartment with the spare key she gave them.,"Okay guys, I'm sorry for updating you guys late and for the super long post, but I want to make sure I get important details in there. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

 Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blf7xp/update_my_roommates_21f_parents_keep_letting/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

TLDR: My family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

I THINK RM IS CRAZY and needs a MH checkup. Seriously. I am very worried for her wellbeing. 

My mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. I told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. My mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

When my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. Me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. I've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
My mom called RM and RD and R to come over to talk. They came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

Mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. She made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and I could tell this was pissing RM off. Some points of the confrontation:

1. Why are you calling my daughter these names?
RM: I didn't say anything. She's making        up lies. 

2. Why are you even in the apartment that much? You told us that you go there once a month to check on R. You also said she visits you every weekend?
RM: The kids don't know how to cook, so I help. Also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. Why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. Why are you going through my daughter's stuff? Why does she need a lock? Why are YOU limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*I shall also mention that Roommate's dad was SITTING IN THEIR CAR ON THE DRIVEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE CONFRONTATION*

But things got heated up really quickly. RM started insulting my parents:

- She said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said I am unruly and that the clothes I wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). This annoyed my brother, and he showed RM IG pictures of R wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. RM shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- She then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""God Complexes"". This pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" This pushed RM OFF THE EDGE, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted TO SLAP HIM. 

This lady tried to SLAP my 24 y/o brother IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS. 

They argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. This time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. She came back to where we were standing AND LITERALLY THREW THE DRESS IN MY FACE.

My mom had no more patience left, and back Slapped RM across her face. I've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and I burst out laughing. Even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of RM. RM started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

When they left we had a big discussion:

My parents were angry that I never told them about this before. They said that they got me that apartment so I could do what I wanted. They wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
However, they are very proud and happy with the way I dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. Thank you all for the advice. I appreciate it alot. ❤

They were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of R cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

My parents agreed that letting R live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. My parent's started the eviction process today. 

Anyways, it may be hard to believe, but I do stand up for myself a lot. It's just that in this situation, I didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because I had respect for their friendship and I didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. I learned from this, and I have growing up to do, but now that I know I have support, I won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

I also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't Indian). No one is living rent free in this situation. 

I would also like to say that even though I wasn't friends with R in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. Idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

Also my parents are liberal ass Indians. They have lived here in America for over 40 years. They didn't want to spy on me at all. They don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

Edit 1: I forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, I don't think it does. I'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. Also, it's my parent's money. They'll do what they want. This gives me no excuse to have a GPA less than a 4.0, Js. 

Edit 2: I took out the part where RM tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  It was funny though. 

Edit 3: I added a TLDR. 

I included most of the important points. If something doesn't make sense I'll reply in the comments. 

The cops are yet to show up. 

Edit 4: GUYS WE FORGOT TO ASK FOR THE KEY BACK. FUCKING DAMN ITTTT

TIFU by creating a dick-shaped island and getting suspended.,"When I was in 8th grade science class we had to draw and create our own land mass in order to demonstrate our understanding of wind patterns, low and high pressures, etc. I thought of the idea to make the island in the shape of a dick. Our group drew it out. Of course we were smart enough to make it resemble a dick but not entirely, we made sure to make it curvy on the sides, edges where the balls were, stuff like that... but it clearly was a dick. We added tornadoes near the balls to look like pubes, added futures like 'seamen lake' and 'crabs port'. We finished and wrote the amazing title, ""PENN ISLAND"", or Pennis Land. We wrote it in big, bold, letters at the top and turned it in. A couple days later our science teacher called my group up to his desk... uh oh... but, we we were not in trouble. Instead he said something along the lines of, ""I would like to put this out in the hall, this is really great work"". Amazed, we all in unison agreed. For months our Penn Island was out in the hall, everyone saw it, everyone laughed and giggled. But the teachers never noticed until one day a parent called the school saying her daughter had told her about Penn Island. Eventually he called our group up after class and told us about it. Then out of no where, he started crying... he apologized for letting us get into trouble, he explained how its his job to keep kids from getting in trouble. HE apologized to US. He said it was his fault. To this day I still feel bad for him, it was never his fault. He was a good guy. The funny part was when we played dumb with him and he had to explain to us why ""Seamen Port"" was inappropriate.

Oh yeah, I ended up getting suspended for a day (the vice principal said I was very clever (one of my proudest moments)). Only me though, since my asshole group members made a plan to blame it all on me... fuck them. 

TL;DR I drew an island in the shape of a dick for a project and it sat in the hall for months without anyone noticing, eventually a parent found out... leading to my suspension.

EDIT: No, I don't have a picture of it. But here is what it basically looked like. The shaded part was brown, and the rest of Penn Island was green. The original was on a 4ft x 4ft paper poster haha. (Yes, those mini islands at the top are exactly what you think)

Absolutely. I will find him and figure this out. 

I'm just letting you know that I am refuting absolutely any claim that I have or had any intentions of quitting.

She won't budge beyond that. She's a professional CYA adherent. Now I'm getting ready to go find him and point out that I am not quitting.

He knows that I am not quitting. Barring mental illness, or chemical influence, he is aware I have not quit.

I've never dealt with an executive manager specifically angry with me to any level really. He clearly wants me gone and I'm blindsided by his actions. Up until this morning I had been working on a proposal to the CEO that would create long term employment opportunities for myself with the company.☹️☹️


Edit 3:  Decided to email HR outlining the issue and requesting assistance. I'm not allowed on the work site until my supervisor is updated on my employment status. I'm taking this time to write a timeline of events leading up to this mornings message. I am also collecting any evidence of my intent to work today. 

I actually messaged several managers yesterday evening with instructions for the change over and offers to assist in any way.  I'm feeling pretty solid about the fact I haven't quit and not very solid at all on my future with the company. It just seems so petty and vindictive. This person is well known in our industry and is very qualified on paper. It just doesn't make sense to me. 

Edit 4: I'm calling HR and hoping I'm allowed to work! I'm afraid that it's not over and that he will try to prove I quit, despite all evidence to the contrary. Wish me luck!

Edit 5: Wow, I was so caught up in my own drama that I didn't realize how big this post had become. I'll do a quick update now and write up a more in-depth response when I have time.
Here's my update:

I have a job!!!

I'm actually writing this from my new office. The male boss, who claimed I quit, relented and allowed the transfer. I saw the CEO very briefly yesterday and thanked him for his assistance in everything and he said ""you shouldn't have to thank me for being allowed to do your job"".

AITA for choosing my brother over my marriage?,"My parents divorced when I was 3, and went into separate marriages. I had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. When I was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. I had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

Five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. My mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. My father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. Obviously my family is morning, and I've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

The only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and I'm not going to let that happen. I told my wife that I was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. She did not take it well and is furious that I would choose my brother over her. I doubt my marriage will survive, but I can't let my brother go into foster care.

AITA for being upset that my parents gave my wedding fund to my sister to freeze her eggs?,"I want to preface this by saying that I've been 100% financially independent from my parents since the day I graduated college. I know they don't owe me a dime and I'm grateful for everything they've given me in life. 

I have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. My sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and I'm happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. Now it's my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. 

My sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. She didn't have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. My sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they're great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. 

I know I sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. There was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. I knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn't want to have an infant at that age. In my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. I don't blame her for being scared. I would have been terrified to. 

But I'm still upset that now I won't be able to have much of a wedding because I had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. I'm not so much upset that they gave it to her, but I am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. That they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. My sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. 

When my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. I couldn't hide my disappointment. I really tried to reassure them that I understood, but they could tell I was hurt. My sister called later and told me that it sucks I can't have a 'fancy wedding' (like hers) but basically I need to grow up. Which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. She said she's sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as I'd hoped. 

I know this isn't the end of the world. This is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and I feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. I'm still getting married. My wedding won't compare to my sister's, but I'm still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. 

Thanks for sticking with me through the story. I know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. So, am I overreacting? AITA?

My niece [5F] and nephew [2M] spend half the week with one parent, and half the week with the other. Howard has them from Friday to Monday morning. 

The current problem—

I have tried to talk to my brother about his expectations of ""help"" and that I find them unreasonable. I am not the second parent in the household, I view us living together as roommates, not really a family unit. I am here until I finish school and can move out on my own. 

He wants to go to the gym or go out with friends, but the times he wants to go are during MY only free time. I feel like I shouldn't be asked to give up my free time when babysitters are available for that kind of thing--he is just too cheap to hire one. His argument, that he would do the same for me, is empty. I don't plan to have kids. He has insulted me for not dropping everything to watch his kids, calling me ""selfish"" and ""shallow"" for not helping him out. 

Howard says-- 

I have an issue with my sister not helping because we live together and we should, as a family, be willing to help when need be. I feel like she has done very little to help with the kids. 

She makes her own meals, but she doesn't offer to help make meals for the kids. She is not home much, but when she is, she will order something small to the house and not ask if I want anything [I will give her $$$]. 

When I ask her to help me get the kids ready for something, she tells me no. We have gotten into arguments because she will see I am trying to get the kids ready and she just leaves, without even asking if I am okay. 

I need to get away from the kids sometimes. I have asked her to watch the kids while I get milk from the store. She says she will pick up the milk for me. When I tell her I need a minute alone, she says the offer is ""I get the milk or nothing."" 

I am drowning in debt, I have a failing marriage, my kids are a lot, and my parents live far away. I just need some help and she has refused to be more than a passing stranger in their lives. I am hurt, overwhelmed, and resentful—which I don't want to be. But I feel like she could help more, or even a little bit. 

Our dad has a pool in the back. She swims laps every morning. It was 90* here the other day and the kids wanted to swim. I had to take calls and asked if she would watch them for 20 minutes. She said, no she was finishing laps, making breakfast, and going out with friends. So she didn't have time. I would desperately like some help. 

Conclusion—

We both think we are right and cannot think of a way to make the other person understand. Thanks for the help

"If you use sex to get what you want, you're a whore, not a victim.","People agree with me when I say this, but then when I apply it to actresses having sex with people to get roles, suddenly it's the opposite. It's not anyone else's fault you were a whore for a role. If women can't get roles without having sex with someone, then it's the other women's fault who are whores that you need to be one to get a role. It's not like movies just wouldn't need women actresses if none of them were whores.

Edit: Nothing wrong with being a whore. Just wrong to lie. Also, dudes who do this are also whores, I just didn't think that was unpopular.",unpopularopinion
TIFU by trying to scare the wife with the kids.,"So just to set the stage here my wife is currently surfing the red tide solo.  During these monthly events my board is kicking it on the beach waiting for better days. 
  So after watching the family friendly Tosh.O we've been playing the scare game trying to freak each other out on random occasions.  Of course I am the master having got the kids and the wife numerous times and they have failed to scare me yet. But enough of me beating my chest, lets get to the fuck up.

  So the 14 year old is grounded and stuck at home and the 8 and 9 year olds have just finished their homework.  My gorgeous wife calls me saying that she is almost home and that I should get the kids out of the house and take them to the park where she will meet us later after she gets home and changes.  Thats when it hits me... What a perfect opportunity for the four of us to scare the crap out of her.  The first thing she does when she gets home is go to our closet to change clothes.

So I hatch the plan with the kids that we should pretend we went to the park but instead hide in the closet to scare Mom instead.  Everyone loved the idea especially since it didnt involve them being freaked out for once.

So we see her pull into the alley and we scramble into the closet and wait.  Im trying to get them to all stop snickering as we hear the garage door close.  Then come the foot steps down the hall...  Her purse hits the desk and we can hear her fumbling around the room.  The dresser drawer opens and in the back of my head a brain cell lights up... But no thats not going to happen... And then it does.  

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and moans start to fill the room.  I look at the puzzled faces of the two innocent ones and the revolting shock of disgust on the 14 year old and did the only thing I could think to do.... ""Hey angel we are in the closet and we were going to scare you.  Coming out in 1 minute.""

We are still trying to process this event.  But needless to say Im still laughing my ass off and she has this sheepish look on her face.  Not sure what we are going to say to the 8 & 9 year old... And I think the 14 year old will never be the same again.  

So there ya go.",tifu
"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men","It's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. It starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by shaving my butthole before a first date.,"Edit1: Technically ""trimmed"" not ""shaved""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So the TIFU happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...

This is gonna be TMI, but that's kinda the nature of TIFU, so whatever. I'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. I also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. Sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and I don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (AKA the Taco Bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it AIN'T FUN. So I had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. Less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. So I trimmed it off at night, added some Aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. Win-win!

Fast forward two days, and I'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. Classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl I've dated, so I wanna shell out the monies of course. Dinner went pretty well, and we got Coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. Turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.

But, guys, I can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  We're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and I just had to let one out. I'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so I'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. And this fart was NOT SILENT! It was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart I've ever had in my entire life, hands down. I was mortified. She immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and I of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. She did not laugh with me...No text-backs so far.

I googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. So a little TIL there for you inside this TIFU. Just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so I can go on dates again.

&#x200B;

Edit2: Man I shouldve used my real account for the awards! Guess I'll have to switch over to this baby.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. Turns out it makes your farts super loud, which I discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after.",tifu

"When I was hired I was given a key and told if I lose it I owe $15,000. I lost it. Do I have to pay up?","I am located in Michigan.  

Okay so when I was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) I was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  I was told that if I ever lost said key I would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

I have lost this key.  (It was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. I was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

So now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money I owe.""   I have received letters from their official letterhead and I am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. And they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

I have no intention of paying the fine.

The catch is that I was told this was the consequence verbally when I was handed the key.  My supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   I replied with ""to be clear, I will not be paying that if I haven't signed yet.  Do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  My supervisor laughed as though I was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

Well he never brought it up again and I of course did not either.  

My question is.  Can I be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" At this point I have not reminded them that I never signed.  I have simply ignored them.  But I worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and I'm not sure how to proceed.  I will be visiting my lawyer Monday.  So hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. I can not afford this ""charge.""

AITA - my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch,"On Thursday evenings my daughter (9F) goes to dance class with her friend Anna (9F). My wife told me to pick my daughter and Anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

I pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. My daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and I ask Anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. We all order and start eating, when suddenly Anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. I ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and I look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

I rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. I felt horrible. I call my wife when Anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and I do not have Anna's mother's phone number. So after Anna is given the all clear I immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

Her mother is furious, saying that I could have killed her child. I said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would I assume something like that. She responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. She also said that she didn't know I would be getting them dinner (School ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so I thought it would be safe to assume I would be giving them food..) I apologized for what happened, but still feel like Anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also Anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

TIFU I forgot to turn off text message preview and notification on my laptop during a presentation. Nasty text messages from an FWB popped up during my talk and were viewed by my co-workers.,"I got to a work meeting a few minutes late. I very quickly plugged my computer in to the AV system and projected my computer screen onto the big screen so I can start my talk. Unfortunately, I forgot to turn off text message preview and notification on my laptop because I was in such a hurry.

During the talk, a new FWB of mine texted me from his office saying he was bored and ultra horny. He then sent rapid fire texts talking about the nasty things he was going to do to me and my impending ""anal destruction"" once he gets his big hands on me this weekend. The notification banners kept coming up with each text and the ""preview message"" function was turned on, so everyone in the audience was able to read them. By the time I noticed (laptop was on mute), it was too late.

No one said anything. There were no questions or comments after my talk. Everyone rushed out of the conference room. I am hoping this is a dream and I will wake up any second now. If there is a God, right about now would be a good time to intervene. I've been a good person all my life. Just saying. 

TL;DR: A room full of my co-workers read nasty text messages from FWB during a presentation I gave today.

Update: Hello, I just want to thank everyone for their comments and concern. I also want to thank the people who gave me the silver and gold awards. My day has been so normal that it feels abnormal. I don't know how else to say it. No one mentioned anything about the texts. I'm sure they're talking about me behind my back, or maybe they weren't paying attention during the talk so they didn't see anything? And yes, I am still meeting my FWB this weekend. Already messed up at work, can't let my FWB down either. Thank you guys.",tifu

TIFU by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.,"This came to a head on sunday night. I've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. Some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

Then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. She would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. This was fine for a few weeks. Then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. I dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. That this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. I wouldnt know.

My mind jumps to affair. The love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. I figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. I basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. She declined, said maybe when she gets back. Like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. So i follow her. There is a dennys down the road from our house. She gets out and goes in. Im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. I go inside and i cant find her. Nowhere to be seen. Its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. She finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""How can you do this to me!"" The fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. My wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""You're caught, where is the guy?."" ""What?"" ""Dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""There isnt a guy."" ""Why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" At this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. In the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""Wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""I had to use the bathroom."" Uncontrolled sobbing. ""What....you had to what?"" ""I had to go to the bathroom."" ""We have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""I dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""A dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" Memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. I just never noticed, never second guessed it. She stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. So many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. Her  shame was brought down by bananas. I could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. So, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

TL;DR my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

Edit. Thank you to whomever decided to award my idiocy and my wifes shame with gold.

Edit 2. For the people asking for proof of my wife pooping.....what the hell is wrong with you. You are devin to me now.

TIFU by asking too much from my gf's mom,"This actually happened today.

So my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. She lives up in Ohio and we reside in Florida. Well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

The last time she visited, she saw an old Wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the Wii Tennis game. I always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

Now to the fuck up.

I thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working Wii and Wii sports game for the next time she visits.

Her: What's that?

Me: Bowl me! If you think you stand a chance. >:)

My step daughter (16) is pregnant. I (31F) am the one who pays for most of her education and I want to cease. Her dad (33M) is disappointed in me. How do I proceed to make my point clear to my husband and step daughter?,"I posted in AITA, throwaway because husband uses reddit. English is not my first language. There is really no good TL;DR other than the title, but that leaves a lot of important info out, still TL;DR at the end. My questions are bolded.

**The reason behind why I pay for the education.**

My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant. An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition, I do so as a payback from when my husband helped me out of a massive debt during our dating years when he made 5 times what I did during that time. He proceeded to gain the international/regional direction of a big company in our country and worked there for some years before he decided to start his own company. Now I make three tomes more than what he is making, but I'm sure he'll double what I'm making within the next 5 years. It had always been my husband who paid for all of An's expenses, her mother took care of her from ages 0-13 while husband provided with money for everything and visited every weekend. We divide all of the other household expenses equally. An's mom has NOT given anything towards child support on the last two years because she insists she has no money.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream and even study in the London School of Economics (just like her dad with his masters). I have been separating some money for this purpose, too. My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. An was not involved in this conversation because husband feared she would tell her mom and mom would take it as an offense and me saying teen moms are sluts or things I never even implied (she's that kind of person). This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first HS year.

**Why is An pregnant and what about the future teen dad?**

I cannot be nice about it. An is pregnant because her mother has a turd instead of a brain. My husband and I started talking to her about sexuality, contraception (I even taught her to put on a condom in a cucumber, it was awkward but oh well), orientations, etc... and actually took her to the gyn and he recommended her the pill. She stopped taking it because her mom told her she would get fat (An was a chubby child and suffered bullying because of her mom), and started using the ""cycle method"" in which she had sex some days before, during, and some days after her period. 

An met a boy her same age in some of her extra-curricular classes. He is not from a well of family, and not a bad guy. I've already talked to the boy's parents and they've agreed to pay something like $300 a month if An decides to keep the baby. That covers two thirds of a reputable daycare for 7 hours a day. We've all agreed that it's next level idiotic to have them marry each other (that seems to be the *way to go* in my country whenever someone impregnates another someone).

**What I'm planning to do**

I plan on taking the money being used towards her education and use part of it towards child support. Per month, I pay the equivalent of 1100 towards her HS (the best one in the country). Her dad has the means to either pay a not so high-end private HS, but definitely a decent one. I also plan on use the money I've been saving for her university in things like my retirement. I have not made an ultimatum towards her. My plan is to tell her that due to her having a child, I'll use the money that used to go to her education towards the unborn being. If she keeps the baby I will not pay for any private university. I firmly believe bio mom needs to step up.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An, but I don't feel so because I'd still be giving her for child support. It's not like I'm leaving her in the streets. **How do I make him understand my reasoning? I truly don't want to be the evil step mother who has no heart and ""cut the step daughter out"", and I also believe he is thinking viscerally with what's the best for his child as he did not experience the teen mom hardships. I want him to understand why I'm not planning to give her everything in a silver plate,** even if I could make an extra sacrifice for paying child support and fancy HS.

**What is happening at the moment.**

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy. An is unsure, and in my heart I believe she does want to terminate, but... her mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

**I want An to understand that what she did was a mistake, that I love her and that I am not punishing her, but that it is not within my reach for us to live comfortably, pay for a fancy school that she will not be able to take fully advantage of, and have a step grandchild at the age of 31.** How do I make a teen feel all that without fucking our relationship? She is a nice kid, but takes after some of her mom's bad traits, such as feeling any type of advice is an attack or every consequence is a punishment.

I truly believe the right way is for her to terminate, not give up for adoption or raise it herself. I do not want to force her to terminate, but I do want her to see where I'm coming from. I also don't want this to fuck over my marriage, I believe dad is hot headed right now. He is disappointed in An, but he's also disappointed in me because he thinks I'm not giving my fullest as I usually do.

**TL;DR: Step-daughter got pregnant due to some belief her dead-beat bio mother gave her. I am the one who pays for her tuition but am planning on stopping that in order to give it for child support if she decides to keep it. I could do both, but I feel that's not my baggage. How do I make my husband understand this? How do I break the news to An without it sounding like an ultimatum of ""abort or I'll stop paying school""?**",relationship_advice
AITA for exploding on my father's wife,"Throwaway  

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I'm 17, Dad is 43, and father's wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple's therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father's wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father's wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father' house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying ""The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,"" and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say ""Don't mess with her,"" with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn't have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years' worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father's racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn't my father's child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn't even deserve any respect from me because she didn't respect my mother's marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven't talked to her since.

Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don't mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn't have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

So who is the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
Boyfriend (26M) hit me and I (26F) am worried he's dead,"This is all so fucking crazy, I wish I could just rewind and start over.

I've been dating my boyfriend since we were 20 and he was always very charming, handsome, and respectful. Basically the perfect guy. My parents loved him and I love him so so much, my heart physically hurts when I think about what he's doing to himself.

He started doing coke more as a social thing - we moved to a new city because he found a better job and his new work friends did it. The first time he did it, I freaked out and was all like what the fuck are you doing, because I do not like drugs one bit. He thought it was fine because it was ""classy"" since it's expensive and businessmen and celebrities do it. I'm not shitting you, he literally said that to me. I thought he was fucking insane but I obviously couldn't stop him. I tried to deal with it and think, okay it's just for fun and it's not affecting his job or anything and we seem fine.

He kept doing it and it drove me insane. A fun treat turned into a habit and when I tried telling him he needed to get help, he'd tell me he had it under control and that he didn't need to do it, he just liked it and didn't wanna deprive himself of feeling good. Btw, he acted like a complete asshole when he was high. Talking a lot of shit and acting like he was super cool. It was nauseating and embarrassing to see him acting like that - the charming guy I loved was gone and replaced with this disgusting, narcissistic character.

I even told him once that I wanted to do it with him because he liked it so much and I wanted to see the hype. I thought he was going to say no to protect me from it. Nope, he got extremely excited and helped me do it. It was okay, I guess, but not anything I would be willing to prioritize over my life. He saw it as a bonding moment and felt more open to talk to me about it, how he wanted to do it together again and how the sex was so much better.

We have been through so much because of this. He's been in rehab twice but left and he's a grown man, I can't force him to do anything. Our parents don't know. His parents were sending him some money when we first moved to help us get started in a new place. They don't send money anymore but he still doesn't want them to know. He doesn't want me to tell my parents because he doesn't think it's their business or a big deal. I feel so incredibly embarrassed as well. I've always been a good kid, never the one my parents had to worry about and my mom would probably have a heart attack if she found out about this.

He came back from rehab and he kept using. Then one night he just disappeared. I tried calling his bitch ass friends and his job and no one knew where he was. I found out he was fired weeks before for fighting someone and destroying shit. He called me in the morning and was just being a condescending asshole, making fun of me for being worried about him and laughing. It was the weirdest shit. I didn't see him for days and it was horrible. He wouldn't tell me where he was.

Then he came back home one night randomly and came into our bed. I was so fucking mad but I was worried about where he was so I let him stay. I was crying and made him promise he would stop or else I was leaving for good. I even got up and packed up a few bags to scare him and it worked, he promised he would never use again if I didn't make him go to rehab. So I agreed that I would take care of him. I took off of work, fed and bathed him like he was a baby. I think he had started using something else too because he just seemed so messed up. He was depressed and angry at me, it was horrible to watch.

Eventually, he got over it and it felt like we were the closest we'd ever been and we loved each other so much. We talked about everything, things I'd never told him before, and it felt like we were on cloud nine. He was determined to stay clean and I believed him. We were okay for a bit, probably one month.

My parents were coming to visit and I was really excited about not having to hide anything - we were good and we didn't have to lie about all that stuff anymore. We could just forget about it. Well, he disappeared again the day before they came and he stole $1,200 from me. I can't even describe how it felt waking up and the house being empty. I couldn't even tell myself he went to the store or something. I knew he was gone. Typing this out, my hands are shaking. I hated him so much for doing that to me. My parents came and I had to lie and say he had a last-minute work conference event or whatever shit, I don't know. They knew something was wrong but didn't say anything. I hated lying to my parents but how was I supposed to tell them - oh yeah, you know that amazing guy you've known for years? He's addicted to coke or crack or some shit and he stole my money and lied to me and I've been lying this whole time and he has no job and he's a fucking lying bitch ass.

When they went home, I went into a depression. I was just thinking about how he came home and we were together and things were so so so good and how everything was actually bullshit. He was so skinny and felt self-conscious about it and didn't want me to see him since I became bigger than him but I didn't give a shit about that, I just wanted him healthy again. When he was going through withdrawal and was sick, I would give him baths every night since he couldn't do it himself. Even when he got better, he didn't want to have sex and I understood. And then one night he asked if I'd take a bath with him. I asked if he was having a bad day and not feeling good but, he gave me this cute smile and just shook his head. I was so excited that I had him back. He really fucking tricked me. Shit.

He ended up coming home a few days later. He was high as shit and didn't even care. He was just smiling and ignoring me, giving me this look as if he was so much better than me like looking at me and smiling or furrowing his eyebrows and shaking his head and laughing while I yelled at him, as if I were crazy or something. I told him I fucking hated him and he ruined my life but he didn't care. And then I said I was going to tell our parents and that got his attention. He started cursing at me, calling me a bitch and slut and whore, things that didn't even make sense. I told him off for stealing my money and he took it out of his bag, saying he actually still had half and threw it in my face. I tried telling him to get out but he said he wasn't going anywhere since it was actually his house. We bought the house together. Yeah, he put more money into it but he hadn't been fucking working for months and I was paying for everything. Then I did something really stupid. I don't know why I did it. I took my phone and said I was gonna call his parents and tell them that their son was a fucking loser crackhead. I was just trying to scare him - I would never call them like that, in the middle of a fight in front of him. Anyway, he was yelling at me to stop and he pushed me on the wall and we struggled for a bit. He tried grabbing my phone but I had quick reflexes and I'm pretty petite so I was able to just pull away from him. Then he grabbed my hand and put his arm on my chest to hold me down and was calling me a bitch and screaming at me. I was yelling back and tried pushing him off me and pushed on his chest and his shoulder and then he slapped me really hard on my cheek. Like, swinging his arm, left a ringing in my ear, bruising kind of hard. He had never hit me before - he used to never like play fighting because he was scared he'd accidentally hurt me.

He let me go and I just sat on the floor and cried. He got really fidgety and I could tell he felt bad about it but he still did it. He told me ""c'mon get up, it wasn't that bad"". I told him I hated him. Then he had a panic attack or something, he started breathing really hard. He just mumbled he was sorry, grabbed some money from the floor and left.

Two weeks later, he called me and was crying and said he was sorry for everything and wanted to come home. I said I never wanted to see him again. He begged and promised me that he would go to rehab but I told him I was over his lies and he promised that he'd get clean for real this time but I kept saying no and that he needed to call his parents.

Then he asked me if I'd come see him in the hospital if he OD'd and I told him no. He cried harder and said he didn't want to die and he was gonna be good for me. I knew he was lying and probably ran out of money or something. I hate myself and think about this every day but I just hope him I hoped he died and hung up. That was a few days ago and I haven't heard from him and I am so scared that he's dead somewhere or passed out on the street and in need of help. I can't believe I said that to him and feel so horrible - that's not the kind of person I am, I would never wish death upon someone, especially him. I don't want him to die. I was just trying to hurt him.

This is so long and I'm sorry but I can't tell anyone about this and it's killing me. I think about everything that happened between us, all the little details that he probably never noticed or remembers. I feel depressed and on edge all the time. My mind is always thinking about him, hoping he's okay. I feel like I wasted my life on him and don't know what to do. I've been dealing with this nightmare for so long and I still miss him so much, my heart physically hurts. What did I do to deserve this?

Edit: Wow. I just want to say thank you to everyone who replied. I certainly did not expect to wake up to 200+ comments and everyone who offered me any inch of support and advice and even criticism (because I know I made mistakes, I should have taken action right at the beginning and not let this escalate and accept his fucked up behavior. I'm an enabler, I know) thank you for listening and I cried a lot reading your comments, that you guys have all been through the same exact thing and he's not gonna change and even if he does, it'll take years and he'll never be the same person and I can't trust him. It's a hard truth to swallow but you guys are right.

It feels like a small weight has been lifted off of my shoulders and those telling me that I'm strong - thank you but it doesn't really feel like it. ",relationship_advice

TIFU by not learning from another reddit post about silent alarms,"So a few weeks ago I read this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9qlsq6/tifu_by_pressing_the_emergency_911_button_at_work/). When reading it I even thought, ""wow how could anyone make that mistake?"". Well today karma got it's revenge! 

So I'm sitting with our secretary ordering pizza's for the office lunch party. I notice that there's a little switch that isn't normally under the desk. So I go about just fiddling with it while we're figuring out which pizza's and how much to order. Some of our desks have electric motors to raise or lower the desk for standing or sitting. I assumed this was some switch on the desk to turn this on and off. So I go to flicking it up and down just to pass the time. 

Boy was I wrong, the police came rushing to the building and our secretary had to run down to figure out what was going on. Suddenly there was a lot of panic because they thought we were being robbed due to how many times I activated it. I didn't activate it 348 times but I had to hit it at least 20 times. Oof.  

I literally did exactly what the user above did. I felt so stupid. On top of that the company has to pay a €1k fine for falsely calling the police. 

**TL;DR:** After reading a post about someone who accidently hit a silent alarm at work and scoffing at how ""dumb"" it was. I did the exact same thing. D'oh!

TIFU by not going to the hospital when I knew something was wrong with me,"As usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. I'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident I was 29 years old. First, a little back story...

Sunday, April 2, 2017 started like any other Sunday for me. I woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. Number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. I drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. I drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. I was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

As I watched the video I felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. Having never had a migraine before, I assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though I was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. They finished the oil and as they did, I texted my girlfriend to let her know that I had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

I got back to her house, popped a couple Ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. I woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. I decided I would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning I would be good to go to work.

I woke up Monday morning still feeling like shit and decided I was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. My girlfriend tried her best to convince me that I needed to go to the ER but I told her I just needed more rest and would be fine. She reluctantly let me try to rest as much as I could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. The only relief I could find was taking pain killers, which I'm not a big fan of, and napping.

I woke up Tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" Against my protest, she dragged me to the ER...and saved my life.

I went in to the ER and told them my symptoms, also telling them that I have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. They sent me to do a CT scan of my head, without the contrast because I wouldn't let them tap an IV on my arm. The CT scan was performed and I was brought back to the room to await the results. As I sat there I caught the Dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""It was at this point I knew....something was fucked up!"" (Dave Chappelle voice)

The Dr. came flying into the room and said, ""Hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. I need to tap an IV on you right now, do another CT scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to Stanford ASAP!""

My life stopped. ""A stroke? I'm 29? How could I have had a stroke?"" I couldn't comprehend what was happening but I looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. I got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (Side note: I live in California but grew up in New Jersey which is where all my family still resides) I quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. I asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

What happened next is a whirlwind. They tapped an IV, did a CT scan then I was transported by ambulance to Stanford ICU. I was greeted by the entire Neurology department, both residents and students alike. The first woman I met said she, ""couldn't believe I was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" She told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

As I laid in ICU they tapped an A-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more IV's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. They had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and I wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. They were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

My parents flew in from Jersey by the next day and I was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (Wednesday). If you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. I've had 3. They lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are NOT asleep. They then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. Let me repeat, YOU ARE AWAKE FOR THIS!

The first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. The blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. I was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and I was allowed to leave the hospital by Friday morning. I used up all my FMLA leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

But wait...there's MORE!!!

6 weeks later I had to go back to Stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. This time they found the culprit. I had what is known as an Arterioveneous Fistula burst inside my brain. It's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. To my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which I did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke I went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. I was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the BEST neurosurgeons in the world. A 3rd angiogram was performed while I was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

I awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain I have ever been in. While I was asleep, two more IV's had been put into my arm, an A-line had been put in my wrist again, and I had a C-line, which is an IV in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. The fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. They could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

The surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me I would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. The next day after the surgery I realized that I had double vision so bad that I couldn't see with both my eyes open. It was either one or the other. I had to patch my eye until I could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. My surgery was on a Wednesday and by Friday I was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

Fast forward, to October 2, 2017.

My vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, I was finally ready to return to work. I was so excited my first day back, even though I wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. Around 11:30 AM I took my lunch and finished reading my book I had been reading. At 12:30 PM I returned to work and about 10 minutes later I decided I had to use the bathroom. I left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. As I walked back, I looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

I could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what I describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. I got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. I started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. I think I tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in April) for help but I don't remember because I blacked out. Next thing I remember was a foreman standing over me asking if I was alright and all I could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

I was delirious, I had smashed my face on the concrete when I fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. My supervisor took me to the ER where they did CT scans, blood work, EKG and chest x-rays. My white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

I did a follow up with my PCP (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to Stanford Neurology to talk with them. And so I have...and this is where I am today...

I was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The issue, as I've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. Due to the amount of time I allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. Had I gone to the ER right when it happened, things may be different today.

What this means for me now is I'll likely lose my Class A license and my career of doing physical work is over. Thank God the company I work for is so large that they can move me to another position where I won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment I feel. Working construction has been my all time favorite. I'm a blue collar guy and I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. I've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. My days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is DONE. It sucks. I'm not happy about it, but I don't let it change my outlook on life.

I refuse to give up on life. I can get through anything and I WILL get through this. I'm out of work until January 8, 2018 at which point I will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as I did before.

I tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. Please, I'm begging you! If you ever feel like something is wrong with you...DO NOT HESITATE! GO TO THE HOSPITAL! Don't be like me, Mr. Toughguy, thinking you can get through it. You know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

I thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. May God bless your life and your health

My parents chose their new families over me so I moved in with my aunt. Now they want back in. But I hate them,"Hi.

So I 16. Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

My father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

After all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.

After a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.

We got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

In the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

Neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

My parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.

I won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.

I am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

Mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

Dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.

As far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

Anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. I don't want them in my life but would I be making the right choice? ""idk

Edit : because people think o just made it up and I am a moody teen

You know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? That was the feeling I constantly had at their houses.

I know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. My parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. But not in the sense ""I want to have her longer"" but ""I took her last weekend! It's your turn"".

Also planing fun activities for the day after I leave. My father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

Every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

Also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. They had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

They shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

When there are family functions I am often excludes. E.g my dad had a family BBQ and didn't invite me 

They forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar Starbucks gift card even when they know I don't like Starbucks. 

So no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",relationship_advice
AITA for kicking my step-daughter out after her extremely hurtful comments?,"A couple months ago I was having a big family dinner (my family + my wife's family). My siblings and I began reminiscing and the topic got to my first daughter that passed away. For whatever reason my step-daughter (20 years old) began to chime in. I should mention that my step-daughter and I have never gotten along, but I've always tried to accomodate her and make her feel loved. The hostility is solely on her part. Her mother and I have been married 5 years.

She told me that I shouldn't talk about my daughter fondly when I'm responsible for her death. Her reasoning is that since my daughter caught SARS from me that I'm responsible, which I don't think is fair at all. Anyone that lived through the SARS outbreak knew how hectic it was here.

I don't know where this was coming from because I've obviously talked fondly about my first daughter in the past and she hasn't said a thing. I demanded she apologize, and when she refused and her mother didn't back me up, I left to stay the night at my brother's house. The following day she only doubled down and would reaffirm it was my fault whenever I asked her to apologise and take it back.

After about a month of constant arguments over this I decided to kick her out and gave her 2 months to find a place to stay. This is a level of disrespect that's unforgivable at 20 years old. My wife doesn't want me to, but I've overruled her since she let this go on for a month without ever reprimanding her daughter. The house is mine (a premarital asset) and this is the only time I've played that card.

AITA?

Asking because obviously my wife thinks so.",AmItheAsshole
[CT] daughter is suspended from school for 2 weeks and school will only let her back if she gets unnecessary therapy update,"Hi everyone, thanks for your responses to my last post.

After I read everything, I called and emailed the superintendent describing what had happened.

Update: I (F30) divorced my ex Husband (M36) because of my MIL(60s) and suddenly he wants back in,"I just posted here yesterday but it feels like weeks have happened.

So I have just left my daughter with my mother and am going to my lawyer again.

I followed some advice you guys gave me and we sat down with my daughter to ""chit chat"".

We knew we couldn't promt any kind of responses my asking overly spesific questions as per her therapist.

So my mother asks my daughter (Lets call her Cat)

""cat what do you and daddy talk about?""

And cat just listed many toddler things like she talks about kindergarten, games etc. When I was kind of relieved that that comment my ex made yesterday may just be a one of, came the big bomb.

""he also shows me pictures of houses and tells me I can have now 2 rooms with loads of stuff!!""

I ask if her dad is buying a new house.

Nope. Turns out that nut wants to take my daughter out of the country. He shows her pictures of beach houses and even bought her allready a bag so she can put her stuff inside it. Wich explains why so many of her clothes have gone missing.

At first I thought that my ex maybe hadn't told me yet because it hadn't come trough. But no he told my daughter to keep this as a secret because momy would get sad if she knew that daddy was going away.

So I am fucking livid. And also sad because I will have to tell my daughter no. Once again I feel lost.

Edit /Update : I talked to my lawyer and we have taken measures that I can't discuss here but we are on it.

I have my daughters passport as we flew last month to visit extended family.

Also I am a US citizen so even if my ex MIL tired to have me deported, that wouldn't be possible",relationship_advice

How do I convince my parents to let me play video games?,"My parents are incredibly strict with my schedule. I've never been allowed to use the computer for anything more than school work (typing this at school), I have to study for like 13 hours in a day to keep them happy with my grades (I get yelled at for not making the straight A's in any exam), I'm forced to engage in sports I have no interest in during my downtime because Dad was an accomplished athlete and wants me to follow in his footsteps or whatever and I get like less than an hour in a day to watch something on tv. Video games are just so foreign a concept to them and they think it's an utter waste of time. They honestly reacted like I asked them for a gun or something when I first raised the topic with them. Is there any hope left for me or do I just have to live without video games for years until I move out?

"Ads are perfectly reasonable for free content, and expecting free content without them is entitlement.","Pretty unpopular, especially on Reddit. 

I think this is an extension of the popular trend of thinking creatives should work for ""exposure"" or that somehow entertainment isn't deserving of a decent paycheck.

Ads are a more than fair exchange for free entertainment. These people deserve to make a profit off of their work, it's that simple.

Using ad blockers to prevent creatives from making a fair wage off of their hard work is also entitlement.

My arts school claims that everything created while using their WiFi belongs to them. Is this legal?,"I go to a school in Pennsylvania that has a heavy focus on the arts. They provide internet to us students, and they also provide laptops. 
Apparently everything created using the school's WiFi belongs to the school. To me this seems awfully exploitative considering they make every effort to keep students from using anything else. Especially in an arts school where they teach primarily minors, many of whom are unaware of this rule.
So I've got a  few questions; Is this legal? How does the legality change if I'm using a personal device, VPN, mobile network, or combination of these? Many students' art has been sold and published by the students. Is *this* legal, or does it nullify the school ownership?

Edit: I went to the administration office and requested a copy of the ""Acceptable Use Policy"" cited by the Student Handbook. Here's the link:

AUP https://imgur.com/a/NwoY6G0

Acceptable Use Policy 

To avoid doxxing myself I've censored my name and the name of the school. Some interesting points: 
1) The document was signed in 2016. I was, at this time, under fourteen years old. This document may also be outdated, but I have not signed any similar document since.

1.1) Even though I was so young, my mother signed an identical document at this time.

~~2) There's a clause that states ""I understand that the Technology Resources provided to me may be protected under copyright law..."" Is this the relevant phrase?~~
As u/Sylvan graciously pointed out, this clause is in reference to licensed programs or materials provided by the school:
""They're saying if the school provides software (eg. volume lisenced MS Office or Adobe Creative Suite), or course materials like online textbooks or references, you agree not to copy it elsewhere.""



Edit: A point I forgot to add. The school may have updated their policy since 2016. They decided (rather inconveniently) this year to go paperless. They didn't explain the policy to us this year, they just told us something like ""You know the rules by now.""

Yet another edit: To clarify, I still don't have all of the pertinent documents. I remember a far more in-depth document discussing school technology policy, and I'm searching for this document now.

(Update) I (35M) caught my wife (29F) rehearsing a speech for my funeral (?),"OP: [ttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9ik5nt/i\_35m\_caught\_my\_wife\_29f\_rehearsing\_a\_speech\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ik5nt/i_35m_caught_my_wife_29f_rehearsing_a_speech_for/)

Tl;Dr overheard my wife talking about me as if I was dead, she said she was reading a book out loud

There were 2 edits to this OP

1 - To clarify I don't believe this woman is capable of murder one

2 -  I looked through her browser history (not snooping, but details won't matter) and she is shopping for wedding dresses?

&#x200B;

Update:

Met a buddy for lunch and told him the whole tale. He too found it morbid af, but did't see her committing first degree murder. Asked me if I thought she could be having an affair (he has a history with weird stuff turning out to be cheater SO). Suggested I get a PI in case of cheating, and call my lawyer in case of murder.

I said I'll consider it. But I know my wife, she is usually pretty shy. I'm still REALLY thinking this might be something silly that got her embarrassed. Was it any other topic, I'd have asked right away. The funeral thing just got me creeped out and I probably would leave it alone if not for my growing curiosity.

Buddy makes a point that there is no harm in calling my lawyer just to check on the procedure to change beneficiaries on life insurance and such, so I'm prepared in the event things go even more weird. I agree, no harm in that. Call the lawyer, tell him I'm discussing finances with the wife and we are thinking about changing both our beneficiaries (trying not to make it look like I suspect her, you know), he says he's stepping into a restaurant with a client can he call me back.

I move on with my work, have a long day, so, honestly, I forget about it.

When I get home late at night, my wife is *upset*. And that is an understatement.

I am quickly educated on two things that happened on her day:

1 - Lawyer called. He wasn't able to get a hold of me anywhere else. Was wondering what were the questions we had about changing the beneficiaries on life insurances. Wife had no idea what he was talking about. He seemed uncomfortable upon hanging up.

2 - Turns out my buddy talked to his wife (in confidence) and told her everything. His wife told a couple of close friends (in confidence) as well. And on it went until the gossip reached a friend of my wife's who actually knew what was happening. She called my wife and told her she should talk to me asap.

She is mortified. Upset, hurt, confused, embarrassed. The whole deal. A little mad as well. Maybe more than a little.

She tells me she joined a community theater, drama club, something, and will be playing a widow. The monologue is an acting exercise to tap into emotions. (Which btw is something many of you told me was a possibility, so thank you, you were right). Her friend (the one who knew what was going on) was the one who convinced her it would be a good idea, to help her out with her shy personality.

She lied about it being a book because she too thinks it is a creepy thing to do, and didn't feel like sharing at the time, since the whole drama club is something she was doing for herself. But she thought I only heard her speaking, as in ""her voice"", not ""what she was saying"". Had she known what I heard, she would have explained it.

I ask her why didn't she tell me about the drama club. She looks at me like I have no business asking her another question for as long as we both shall live, not even about the weather. But she says it is ""her thing"" and she even made her friend promise not to mention it because she didn't want all of us at one of the plays (we are a tight bunch) until she was more comfortable on stage.

I say she could have just told me, to which she replies with something like ""are you telling me that you can keep something private that happens in our household to yourself without bringing all our friends into it?""

After the latest events I don't have an answer for her.

But I'm still missing a piece of the puzzle. So I ask ""what about the wedding dress?"".

This is when I realize this part of the story didn't reach her yet. She asks me ""what"" and I have the pleasure of telling my wife I went through her personal computer.

**Now** she is homicidal.

Grabs me by my shirt, drags me up to our closet and shows me ""the wedding dress"" (in the making) for the play. It is amateur theater, so they have more than one job and she is also helping with the costumes, wardrobe, whatever it is called. She was looking online for cheap dresses or for styling ideas to make her own (she is quite skilled in making clothes and such, and the search history did say ""old"" or ""vintage"" wedding dress). She also shows me nun's clothes and a pirate's in her closet and asks me if that means she is attacking the British. By now I am just wondering what the fuck is this play about? A bride, a pirate and a nun? Who the fuck is writing this shit? But I'm guessing I shouldn't be talking anymore.

She is pissed that I would think she is capable of murder enough to call our lawyer, that I told all our friends about her embarrassing monologue and went through her personal computer. Not to mention ruining the drama club she was enjoying.

I just nod, apologize profusely, try to explain that things didn't happen quite like that, and show myself to the guest bedroom because we both know where this is going.

She then tells me I can't even sleep there. Since my brother and his wife will be staying with us for a few days, she already changed the sheets and had everything cleaned and ready and says ""you will just make a mess""

So last night I had the privilege of sleeping on the couch.

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr Wife was practicing my eulogy, turns out it was a play. I got to sleep on the couch and am currently hoping she wont file for divorce.

&#x200B;

Edit just to be safe: I realize I took some liberties with my writing.

Just to make it clear: I think she was more upset with the version of the story that reached her than the actual facts. It will take her a moment to process the stuff (what actually happened) I told her. Also, she didn't use any literal physical violence against me. That was just bad writing on my part.

You all be good, you wonderful people

Edit 2:

People calling it bullshit made me smile. People saying the fact I didn't answer to those calls proves that it is bullshit made me smile some more.

I mean no disrespect, but I have a job, guys.

Look, I had a weird problem and I want to say ""thank you"" to everyone who took a few moments of their days to help a stranger. I was creeped out and you all truly helped, so thank you!

To the ones asking for more details... I mean, I could say my wife is a Pilates instructor who has most of her day to herself, that our study is a mess of fabric and half made clothes so she could be working on costumes for the whole Cirque du Soleil and I would still be oblivious, I could answer every single question you all have until my fingers went raw, but let's face it: it would be pointless. And I would have to share more personal details than I am comfortable with. I even mentioned on comments I kept some details (and people) out of the story for this very reason.

Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?,"Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It's a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". It's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. Second I've know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn't time stamped so I don't have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we're past that. But apparently this person or persons isn't.

The whole thing is strange. I'm not sure what's going on. I haven't told my wife, I'm not sure how she would take it. She's very sexual and adventurous but I don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don't think I'll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.

EDIT - update. I'm overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.

I did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.

The two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

The other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

Why?

She admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.

For the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn't seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she'd rather I didn't have it but now that I did, oh well. 

It still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I'm just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn't give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.

Thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

EDIT II - I want to clarify something. I've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.

Look, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn't say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. And for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I'll ignore you thank you very much .

FINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife's Facebook account - childish and immature I'll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I'm questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It's time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest .",relationship_advice

AITA: Blowing up and getting banned from domino's after being lied to,"One Sunday around 8:30 P.M I decided that I wanted pizza. I placed an order online with Domino's for a pretty standard pizza and set it to delivery with payment as ""cash."" The tracker online said ""35-45 minutes."" (They close at 11:00)

1 hour has passed. I called to check on the status of the pizza. The manager answered the phone and asked what I would like to eat. I mention my order number, the estimated time, and what the ETA was. The manager replied, ""oh, that was just sent out; you should get your pizza soon."" 

30 minutes go by and no pizza has arrived, and the online tracker is now bugged. I call again and get the same manager. I explain to her that I was the guy who called earlier and I am checking in on the pizza. She then tells me, ""Oh, the driver said you canceled that order."" To which I matter of factly say, ""No, I didn't."" She then told me she would check with the driver but then hung up. I call in again and she instantly picked up the phone and hung up. This happened 3 more times. I then call and get put into a hold where domino's promotions are just looping. 

I simply order a new pizza from hot box and decide to stop by Domino's on my way there.

I make my way to their building, and I see: chairs on tables, oven off, one driver sitting and texting, and the manager texting at the counter. I then call from my cell. Manager looks at the phone, eyes the screen, and lets out a very visible sigh. She hung up the phone instantly while the driver looked up and laughed. 

I casually walked in and went up to the counter. She looked up from her phone and asked what I would like. I say in a low, snide tone, ""I would like ""X"" pizza, oh wait, that's actually the pizza I ordered from hot box because you guys are so incompetent that you couldn't deliver a pizza in 2 hours or see fit to answer your phones, have a good night."" Two middle fingers on my way out. As I'm driving away, both the manager and driver come out and flip me off to which I return the favor. I then drove to hot box. 

I pull into a side street to park on the curb, and the man in the car behind me honks. I figure I just took someone's parking spot. As I put my car in park and get out, it's none other than the driver. He then gets out of his car and says, ""Where do you get off talking to my manager like that!"" I don't think I've ever been angrier in my entire life. I screech, ""YOU GUYS FUCK UP THAT BADLY AND HAVE THE AUDACITY TO BITCH WHEN YOU GET CALLED OUT; ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?!""

The biggest privilege nobody ever talks about is attractiveness and it affects most things in life,"It doesn't matter anymore what color your skin is, what background you are from, how smart you are, any of those things... when you are attractive. If you are attractive you start life with a major advantage. It's the biggest privilege in life one can have. If you are a handsome man, even when you are in jail for a heinous crime women will see the good in you and write you love letters. If you are a beautiful woman, you can have any rich man you wish, or get a job over a more qualified individual due to your looks.

You could be in prison right now, and be [handsome as fuck with cheekbones for days and a bone structure that makes Michaelangelo weep from Heaven's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Meeks) and all of a sudden your criminal record no longer matters. What matters is, you're a handsome ass dude. And your looks will give you opportunities that a less attractive man of more 'privileged' background would never have access to.

TIFU by plagiarizing from my OWN Reddit post and getting threatened to be dropped from my University,"***Background***

I am a very passionate writer. I *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. Every week I would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  

***Story Time***

Last year, on r/WritingPrompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. I forget the full details, but it intrigued me and I wrote a 6-PAGE STORY about it. Anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but I still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that Reddit post.

**^((It was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**

***Present*** 

So a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. So I was like, okay sweet I don't need to spend any time on this project. I went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. To be sure I don't get into any trouble, I delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. 

Yesterday, I get an email from the Professor saying I need to meet with the Dean immediately. At this point, I am shitting my pants. She told me that I stole someone else's work and I could be withdrawn from my program. I try to explain but I have no proof that it was my work because I no longer live at home and I wrote it on an old laptop. I have a meeting with the head of the University later today. I am so fucking scared. I am currently driving home to find that fucker.  

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I copied and pasted my own work from my own Reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. Could be withdrawn from my program


Edit 1: [17:00] I found my original work. Took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. Travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. I'm okay with taking a zero, obviously, I just hope they can reason. 

Also, I can't show the Reddit emails because I never had a real email for the account. 

Edit 2: SUCCESS! I brought my old laptop to the University principal and provided proof that I was the one to write the story. They were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what I told them before. They asked me why I did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. I told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. 

*Results*

I am not kicked out, and I am actually given another chance at the project. My professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. 


Thanks everyone who supported me through this! I won't do this again. I'm sorry. 


Also, thanks u/SQUID_FUCKER for the suggestion

> Just read all the edits.  You know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  If the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.


Maybe this will be the plot of the new story. ",tifu
Caught HOA trying to break into my house. Now they've issued me a $1000 fine. [WA],"I bought a house 18 months ago which was a member of the HOA. I did change the front door of the house to something a lot more secure. 

About a month ago, in the middle of a weekday I noticed two people trying to open the door with keys which weren't working, I confronted them (while my wife called the police) and it became apparent that they were officers of the HOA trying to look for an infringement.

There is a section in the CC&Rs that says ""the association is entitled to access the homeowner's property with reasonable notice"" and also a section that says ""the homeowner may voluntarily submit the property keys to the association, however once submitted the association is not required to return the keys. Submission of a key which does not work may incur a fine determined by the board"" which according to them, the keys to my property has been submitted (I'm assuming the previous owner have done so).

I have spoken with two board members who said they suspected that the keys that they hold for my property may have been fake and they've authorized their officers to check this out. They say according to them, in this case as they were searching for an infringement, reasonable notice means no notice to ensure that I won't have time to replace the locks.

And now I've received a $1000 fine because the keys submitted for my property to the HOA are fake. I have talked to a board member who tells me that their interpretation of the contract is that once a real key is submitted, the key must be kept up to date at all times or a fine is warranted. 

They also told me to not fight this as according to the bylaws the HOA is entitled to recover their legal fees from me in case I bring them to court or they bring me to court. So I'll lose either way because legal fees will end up costing me more than the fine itself. 

Not sure if it's relevant, but the office of the HOA looks a lot like a leisure room. They have a pool table, a bar with a fancy fringe and a ton one drinks, a large TV and couches and stuff like that. And this isn't an amenity that is available for the people in the neighborhood, this is the ""relaxation room"" for the HOA officers and board members who are all old retired people. I definitely felt like this fine is for me to fund whatever they have going on there. 

Help? I also want to add that this is a house. Not a condo or apartment. ",legaladvice

UPDATE: My Landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. Wtf do i do.,"Because I know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  You all helped break the cycle of panic.

Original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

Turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  It was my roommate SAYING my landlord had said I couldn't hospice there.

Yeah.  I know.

I specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding I would be dying in this house.  I'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  And I guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  So instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""You can't do in-home hospice here"".  


Obviously this is super illegal (thanks, LA!), and I call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking Saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  Lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

I started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after I threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and I call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what I was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

So yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because I subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  My attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  Everybody wins?  

Except I still gotta die, yo.  After I move lol.  At least I can afford it I guess.  :(

AITA for skipping my own wedding to see my dying grandma?,"This actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and I honestly don't think I'm in the wrong, I figured I'd ask for an outside opinion.

My girlfriend (then fiancée) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

Now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that I've never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real ""mother""  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

About a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn't have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer's help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

Fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma's condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

She doesn't pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fiancée multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she's my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.

My fiancée was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won't even know I'm there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn't matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. 

She ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fiancée didn't talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fiancée she should take top priority no matter what. My opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

So yeah that's the back story. We have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. Will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my GF.",AmItheAsshole

My toddlers grandmother stealing his identity?,"Just to give a little back story I have a son who is a year and half old. Me and his mother are no longer together but he lives with me now. Before he lived with me about 4 months ago, he was living in Florida with his mother and her mom. 

Her mother is notorious for stealing her children's identities, opening credit cards, putting bills in their names. Stuff like that. So it occurred to me that I dont have his social security number card. I asked his mother if she took it to Florida with her and she told me her mother stole it from her. 
Obviously this is a concern to me. I thought maybe I could check his credit on credit karma or something to see if shes used it yet but he isn't old enough for me to check that way. 

Is there a way for me to check if shes using his ssn? If not is there some way I can preemptively report her for stealing his identity even if I'm not sure that shes used it yet?

TIFU by walking in on my teenaged son masterbating.,"This just happened and I am still wishing it didn't.   My  15 year old son and I are home, I'm working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing Fortnite.   He disappears for a little while and I go to find him.    I didn't really need him for anything, just wanted to say 'hi' since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.

I start walking down the hallway towards his room—our house isn't super big and I knew he was in there.   The lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but I could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.

I decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   He was lying with his back to me, I could tell by where his phone was.   As I am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, I see it.   My son's boner.   As I was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   It all happened so fast and I was already airborne before I realized what was happening.   I did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son's boner through his boxer briefs.   

The entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, I'm sure.   I have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, AND I DON'T WANT TO.

At that point, I am still flopped down on his bed.   Both of us are well aware that I just saw him whacking off.    Both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   I say, 'Dinner is almost ready.'   (It wasn't)
He said, 'Ok, I'll be out in a minute.'
I said, 'No hurry.'

Now I'm standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he'll need if he ever finds out I posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering WHY DON'T BOYS CLOSE THE DOOR WHEN THEY ARE MASTURBATING?  

tl/dr:   Basically the title.     

Edit: spelling.   Dammit, I can't change the spelling of 'masturbating' in the title.   Oh well.   I fixed 'Fortnite' though.   

Edit 2:  for those asking:

—I am mom.
—I want to be clear, I have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   I am a nurse.   I talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   The horrifying part is that I walked in on him.   That was not ideal.  For either one of us.  
—his door was OPEN.  
—I have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before I walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   
—he isn't on any social media.   I am quite confident that his identity is protected.

I [M/31] Just caught my girlfriend (now ex)[F/32] redhanded cheating on me with her ex.,"Needless to say I'm crushed.  I felt something was about 4 months ago, sex diminished greatly (we had sex 4 times in the last 4 months) she seemed more distant, she would get mad at me over petty things, she was a hawk over her phone, she would randomly stop texting me some night and tell me the next day she fell asleep.  We are talking 730-830 PM ""falling asleep"". The straw that broke the camel's back was this past Sunday she said she was setting boundaries and she wanted one day to herself a week when she doesnt have her kid.  She also said she'd let me pick the day so I felt comfortable with it. 
That felt really weird to me. 
Tonight, she came over and left early saying she had a headache.
About 20 minutes after she left a friend called me and said he by random chance saw her pulling into another guys driveway (friend knew where she lived and that a guy lived at the house she pulled into, small town).
He gave me the address and I immediately left my house.  
I arrived, banged on the door, no answer, bang again,  no answer.  Finally.... her ex answers the door... in his underwear.
I asked, ""is kendra here?"" He responds, ""yes, who are you?""
I reply, ""her fucking boyfriend, did you know about this?""
He said he didnt know.
I said, ""if you knew about this, then you two deserve each other, if not then I'm sorry you had to find out this way.""
Turned around and left.

I'm so heartbroken.  I thought when I met her that I'd be able to trust someone finally. 6/6 of my exes have cheated on me.  That's not assumed, its confirmed.  They've either admitted it, or I've caught them.

I'm so lost.  I'm to the point where I believe everyone cheats.  I dont know what's wrong with me.  I feel so worthless and low.  I dont know what I need to fix to make people stop cheating on me, I've tried so hard to figure it out.  I feel ugly and hopeless.

The last things I've texted her since I went there were, ""You're a worthless piece of shit."" 
""How can someone be so nice to your face while they stab you in the back"". (That was something she told me just a few days prior talking about her ex cheating on her with prostitutes) You're a joke.
Thank you for destroying any trust I'll ever have in a human.  You're fucking scum.""

That was probably too much.  I'm not gonna say anything else to her, there's no point, I doubt she cares enough to respond.

I'm so broken right now, I dont think I can ever trust another person, I'm pretty sure every person cheats.

Website refuses to take down the ad for seasonal renting of our squated house,"So, this is a bit muddy because the website is international (and very popular, starts with a B), the house is in France, the owners (us) are French but the house is squated by UK citizens.

Namely, my husband's family, who we let in the house graciously. After a few years, because of bad blood we asked to get our house back, they refused. Here again we are rather in the dark, we are communicating through lawyers but it has been on a stand by since June, I think our lawyer is crap but that's another matter.

We originally bought this house to rent it to tourists but never got a chance (the family moved in the moment we bought it).

Now, they were legally asked to leave by the 1st of June (I have shown the paper to the website). Obivously they didn't, but on top of that, they have been renting rooms to tourists since March.

I contacted the website, provided them with proofs of ownership etc, expressed my desire to see the illegal renting stop. I called several times, sent several mails, starting April. While it was momentarily made unavailable, the renting has continued and still is going on.

Last time I called, the guy told me that it was up to their law service, he couldn't say/do anything. I threatened to go to the police, he encouraged me to do so. Unfortunately, the police won't do anything, I have to go to the tribunal and ... pay a lot of money that I don't have.

I then appealed to the law that says I can ask for my personnal data to be taken off a website, as there are pictures of our house, exact location etc... same thing, temporary disabled then back on the website, no answer.

From what I understand, the squaters have bought another house and are making the most of our house to make profit during summer before hopefully leaving, but at that rate i'm wondering if they are ever gonna leave if they can rent it for the whole year. I would really want to see it shut down.

Do you have any idea what I can do?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT : Sorry to the mods, I think I inadvertantly gave you a lot of work!

To answer some suggestions, it is illegal for me to change the locks, add locks, block them in anyway. Even though they are illegal in the house. Welcome to France... They also ""only"" rent rooms in the house, while still living in it, so I can't rent it and take over. I still have the keys, my husband went to get some of our stuff at some point and was verbally and almost physically attacked (my family buffered), insulted, they called a friend to block the car and so on... the extent of the bad blood is going quite far now. 

I definetely get your point about the lawyer, we are going on holidays for 4 days, if when we come back nothing has changed I will get a new lawyer. This is ridiculous. I'm litterally wondering if my lawyer has been bribed or something... 

Between the website not complying, my lawyer who is crap and these people who litterally pushed my husband to suicide and then refused to help the search party, I am utterly disgusted and hoping they get all lost very, very far...

Somebody stole my identity to pay for their entire pregnancy - FL,"While vacationing in Key West, FL in February 2018, I was robbed of a backpack containing (among other things) my passport, my California drivers license, and my health insurance cards. I reported it to the proper state and federal agencies, and was certainly pissed, but did not really dwell on it. 

About six months later I start getting collection notices for various healthcare facilities for obstetric services. So I call them up to dispute, right? Surely a mistake. But they have my health insurance info, a copy of my (stolen) drivers license. All of the health info is in my name. Apparently I'm now 4mos pregnant and have been going to every sonography clinic in the Gainesville area on sometimes a weekly basis, to get sonograms of my healthy baby girl. I'm disputing bills left right and sideways for months from hospitals, OBs, general practitioners, geneticists, sonography, even ERs, when I receive a whammy of a \~$15,000 bill for fucking labor and delivery, and a week long NICU stay for a baby girl. 

In reference to those who are owed money, either nobody is believing me that it's not me or nobody's wanting to actually deal with it. They keep telling me that I need to physically come meet with them, which is fair I suppose, but I live in California and I work, so it's not like I can just hop on over to a random part of Florida and tour a bunch of healthcare facilities. I have neither the money nor the vacation time for that. 

I reached out to the local police where I live, who are apparently unwilling to do anything but take a single report and then never follow up ever. I was unable to file a report in Florida, Key West citing the fact that they wouldn't take a report over the phone and Alachoca (sp?) citing the fact that it was ""a civil issue"". I reached out to my insurance company, and they dropped me citing fraud--I didn't think to reach out to them for quite some time, and apparently they were pissed about that. I have no idea if they're investigating anything on their end or not. I reached out to the credit bureaus and froze my credit, and let them know as well.

TIFU putting a half million dollar order of spicy mayo,"This happened an hour ago sadly, I work as a delivery driver for a Japanese resteraunt and it was really slow. Me and a coworker who im cool with were talking about messing around on the computers we use to take orders, so i had previously tried making the most expensive order of filet mignon and we decided to see how high of a bill we could get. It started off at 100 dollars for a single plate, doing every customization possible and adding as much as we could to it. But then i had the fantastic idea of seeing what the highest we could get using the quantity function. We ended up putting $541,000 worth of spicy mayo and thought it was pretty funny. The phone rang and my coworker picks up the phone, and instead of pressing cancel, sent the order. I grabbed the recipt as quick as i could but the damage was done. Our computers couldn't handle roughly 1 million orders of spicy mayo and anytime we tried to open the order to delete it, it would crash. Our boss, who isnt the best at english noticed the commotion and saw the problem. We all tried fixing it but it was no use and he called support. It ended up getting fixed but my record of not making any mistakes was tarnished with my half a million dollar order of mayo. 

Tldr: i ordered $541,000 worth of spicy mayo on our work computer and ended up messing up our conputers",tifu
Michigan. I was denied a restraining order because my abuser said I'm kinky and because of my sexual history.,"In October, in the process of getting out of an abusive relationship, I filed for a restraining order and filed a police report and gave evidence such as text messages in which my abuser admitted to doing it. I gave the same copies of texts to the police when I filed the police report.

At the protective order hearing, his defense was that it was consensual because I have a sexual history involving BDSM, and that I was simply trying to ""punish"" him. We did not have that kind of sexual relationship, and hearing the judge asking him questions about my sexual history was extremely upsetting. They were laughing and joking about how ""you'd think it would be the other way around"" that I was a more experienced submissive than my ex was an experienced Dominant. I brought a eyewitness but the judge did not want to hear from my witness at all. He said it sounded like a ""bad breakup"" and gave me a restraining order for a few weeks as a ""cooling off period.""

Today I found out that the prosecutor is charging him. I know that there is a higher burden of proof for criminal charges than there is for a restraining order, so surely I should have been granted an actual restraining order, right? I want to know if I have any recourse for how the judge acted during the restraining order hearing, because it definitely put me in danger, and I worry that others will be put in danger too. I don't care about trying to get money, I just really feel like this is not the series of events that should have occurred. Is there anything I can do?

Also, do I have to worry about my sexual history coming up in court? I'm really hoping the prosecutor won't allow it.",legaladvice

TIFU by asking where the condoms were,"So this actually happened today. I was up early this morning and decided to go to my local 24hr discount supercenter. You know the one, the mart that has walls. Anyway I went to pick up a couple items and of course ended up getting more items then intended. On a whim I decided to get a box of condoms, I had read on reddit about this one brand that was pretty good and apparently the brand I had always used in the past were shit. I perused the health and beauty as well as the pharmacy area for about 30 minutes. I can never find shit in these stores and knew it was somewhere in one of these sections. Now I've been married for quite some time and we don't use condoms anymore, this was more for curiosity sakes. I'm not really shy but I knew I was going to have to ask someone where the condoms were and suddenly felt like a 16 year old boy. 

I had walked past a lady probably in her early to mid forties about a dozen times at this point and figured what the hell. So I walk over to her and apologize for having to ask, but where are the condoms located? She immediately responds with a bit of a lisp and points to her ears, she then says can you write it down? At this point I just wanted to walk away, but I knew this would appear rude so I reluctantly write down ""condoms?"". She goes ""ah"" smiles and starts walking down the aisle as if she knows exactly where they were. Relieved I follow along. She then stops, looks at me, and says ""for shaving?"" and makes a hand gesture for shaving your face. Again I'm ready to bail but she continues walking to another aisle to another associate. There were a couple other customers in the aisle with the employee. This woman decides to take her piece of cardboard with ""condoms?"" written on it and display it like a limo driver at an airport looking for passengers. I was mortified...everyone is looking at me. Thankfully associate #2 says oh they're right here and goes to the next aisle....they only had one brand and it wasn't the one I was looking for. Mission failed.

[UPDATE] I (29M) showed up to my gf's (25F) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am.,"Update to original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw3cuz/i_29m_showed_up_to_my_gfs_25f_house_and_found_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This all happening a couple days before what would have been our anniversary. I obviously should have seen the signs from the first post but the first part of this update is letting you guys know that I initially did not end the relationship. (What a regret).

How I handled it was we met the next morning to talk and I let her explain her side of things. She explained that other people were at the house that night earlier and she was going to be hanging around with kids from class sometimes now that school has started. Keep in mind, she is 25 and going back to school now, and most these kids are around 19-22. Nothing super serious as far as class load is concerned, she is studying theater at a community college. I explain to her why all signs point to that being a major red flag, she somewhat hears me out and apologizes for not better communicating her plans that night, but defends herself that hanging out with friends from class is not wrong. So in the future she would be communicate better about her plans and do a better job not making me feel concerned.

I was obviously angry and upset about the previous situation but I did truly love this girl and was willing to give things a chance to progress forward and her show me the positives changes.

We had continued our relationship and everything was going good for the most part. Then recently communication did not seem to be going the best and there were some signs that she wasn't giving as much effort into the things we spoke about before as she had promised to do. There were signs of her actively trying to pick fights, and perpetuating them longer than needed even when i had made attempts to reconcile and move forward from any arguments. I did feel heavily at this time that she was not respecting me in these conversations, and any attempts I made to lovingly let her know this...met with hostility. Which she then would attempt to turn right back on me, like it was my fault the fight even happened. This was getting old but I was still making every effort to bring us back to a good space on a more every day basis because i was wildly in love with this girl and the connection i thought we shared. The deceiving thing as well is that she was also very good at making me feel at other times she felt the same way about me, 'You're the love of my life, I Love you more than anything, Future plans together, talking about how lucky she was to be with me' etc. These were all exploited to be absolute lies.

Fast forward to a few nights ago. We had plans to hang out that night and when i asked her earlier in the day what she wanted to do, she told me she had actually agreed to go get sushi with a friend she hadn't seen in awhile. I let her know this upset me since she was bailing on our plans, but in attempts to be understanding I then suggested we just meet up after instead and go out that night to do something fun. She did not give me a definite answer but kept bouncing around the subject saying she would keep me updated on when she was finished. I let her know, 'Hey you don't cancel plans with your bf, then when hes cool about it and tries to suggest something else... leave him up in the air saying maybe we can hang' It makes me feel like not a priority and isn't how you treat someone you love. She ends up going off on me again and we leave on the terms of Ok we will just talk later. I call later and let her know that after dinner it would mean a lot if we could spend some quality time together, I had been wanting that since all the time we were hanging out was during the day with other stuff going on sometimes.

She calls me after dinner around 930pm and lets me know she is home. I ask her to comer hang out so we can figure out what to do, and she deflects with ""Oh my other friend (girl who i know) wanted to go to a midnight showing of a movie tonight and i haven't seen her in so long"".... I know i may seem completely stupid to you guys at this point but i assure you I was already seeing through her bullshit and knew something wasn't right. I keep calm and just let her know i think that was messed up, bums me out, and that i wish she would at least try to include me with her friends when doing stuff like that. She then takes to the level of trying to make me feel bad that I cant just be understanding she maybe wants to hang out with her friends without me sometimes. She tells me she will call me after the movie and asks if she can come over and spend the night with me after its finished...

Meanwhile, I knew I had friends going out that night as well and I could go grab some drinks with them, finish up around same time and then meet back at my house to spend the night together. I did not tell her I was going out because it did not seem relevant at the time, and i had some weird suspicions that something else was going on.

1:45 AM rolls around and Im leaving the bar with some friends to grab a burrito before heading home. I walk down the street and LO AND BEHOLD there she is on the corner of the street standing with a guy. One of the same guys from that night at the house in my original post. Shocker, I know. I confront her and ask her whats going on, she attempts to even further lie, explain how her gf was suppose to come to (like that makes it any better lol) it isnt what it looks like, blah blah blah same old bullshit lies and NO accountability even when caught in a dead lie on a date with another guy. I turn to the guy and ask him whats going on, he explains he invited to the movies, not much else, looks kind of scared because I'm sure i was irate. I have no problem with him at all because its 100% my then gf's fault. I walk to the side with her and ask her to just be real with me for once, tell me whats going, and come to terms with who she is and what shes done here. She shuts down when she realizes she cant talk her way out of things, and tries to ask if we can talk tomorrow and not make a scene here. I tell her if you want to explain yourself then you can leave right now and i will at least hear you out. She says no im not leaving my friend here alone you are overreacting and its not as bad as it looks. Even though i'm pretty hurt at this point I cant help but to bust out in laughter at the disbelief of the whole thing now. I tell her this is it and this relationship is fully done now then. Should have been done awhile ago, but that seals the deal and I truly see you for who you are now, a lying manipulative actual sociopath. I left with my friends, blocked her on everything and am now moving forward for good.

I do want to say though, I made a huge mistake in this whole scenario by not leaving when my gut told me to. So many signs pointed to her being so fake, such a liar, and not trust worthy at all... but i let the good times and her manipulative words keep me around thinking that i Just needed to make more effort myself to make things work. And it wasn't until i had fully given all of myself into trying, that i was hit with the most disrespectful thing I have ever had done to me. Listen to your gut people, and follow you intuition. If you are making clear efforts in a relationship with someone and they are giving you nothing back, creating friction, and show no remorse in any of their mistakes... run for the hills.

Even though i was very hurt by the deceit and catching someone cheat on me, I ultimately know this is 100% for the best and a huge blessing in disguise because this person never truly loved me the way I cared for them. Who knows how much longer I would have stuck around and let myself be treated like this, but I am grateful it happened now and there is no chance in hell i would ever give her a second of my time again. Sorry for the novel, it feels good to vent. Much Love.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Attempted to work on things with my gf, gave serious effort and understanding to her. Felt I was being treated very poorly in regards to that and got suspicious of her actions. Caught her on a date with another guy. Broke up with her on the spot, blocked her on everything, moving on.

Edit: I really appreciate all the positive response  and feedback I've gotten here. As well as all the insightful messages I've received. I am doing my best to respond to everyone who has taken the time to give me their input, positive or negative. Thank you

Edit 2: For the people responding thinking I was making assumptions about the situation i walked up on that night, and defending that it could have been just a friend. Let me explain that there was no way it was not what it looked like. I did not include the whole dialogue exchange between us, but the guy did make it clear he was under the impression they were on a date. Which is when i walked away because it definitely contradicted her whole made up story.",relationship_advice

*UPDATE* My sons mothers bf made him pee in a pill bottle,"I posted the link to the original post at the bottom of the page. I've been working on things on my end but 4 days back cps made my sons mother take a drug test. She failed and they came to pick up the kids and she wouldn't let them in. The police had to kick the door in and take the kids. They then placed them with her father. Nobody had notified me or called me about any of this or my son. I had been calling once a day to check on him and not getting an answer. I eventually called her stepfather who informed me what had happened and asked if anyone had called me and I told him they haven't. I had no idea about any of it. When I found out yesterday I immediately went to cps and met with the caseworker who told me to go home and she would be there within an hour to check my home to make sure my son could live there. I waited all night and nobody ever came or called. I'm preparing to go to cps when I get off of work this morning. Is there anything I should be doing besides talking to cps who really don't seem to care at all about how badly I want my son with me where he is taken care of and safe? I feel like all of these events were hidden from me due to the fact that I could get my son based on these events. Should I still get a lawyer for custody or could the state give me custody over this matter?

Edit: CPS removed my son from his grandfathers and gave me full custody! Thanks for all of the advice! He's so excited to see me and be with me!

AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?,"**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** 

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. I'm 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. And while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

He isn't a bad guy, I'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. I think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it's pretty separate. 

So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him.

I didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. I was  so embarrassed and mortified. She had already read the whole thing and my comments. I honestly didn't know what to say I could only say I was so sorry and that I didn't want her to find out like this. She was calm.. Told me it was okay, said it touched her.. Can't really describe how I felt. We just held each other for a very long time. Might be weird but I knew I needed to be with her when she found out. I started thinking about a life without her, and I simply couldnt. I can't give up on this girl. We've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. I have apologized over and over.. She's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. A person this special I won't find again, but I hate myself for having thought about breaking up. She's still the same person. I should have communicated my feelings to her. I'm a very lucky guy. I really do love her to the moon and back. 

Regarding therapy, I have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. Y'all were right. Can't hurt to give it a try, maybe I was unlucky with my former therapists. But I already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. And the girl who I talked to I've cut off completely. My gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. Didn't realize she was into me. We're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

Thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. I was lost but I know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. I'm with her till the end. We're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. We're doing very well now. She knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. Hope everyone here has a great day. Thanks.

"I [22F] kept my sexual abuse a secret from my entire family for 15 years. Today, everyone found out.","I was around 6-7 when an uncle of mine sexually abused me repeatedly. It was absolutely horrible. I lived with a lot of emotional pain for a very long time. However I dealt with it internally and it took me many years to be in a good place mentally. After a long tome, I finally learned to not let it control my life and I was happy. The whole time, NO ONE knew. No one in my family had any idea. My mom had a suspicion but I always refused to admit it to her out of embarrassment.

Today, the same uncle who sexually abused me( let's call him X) accused another uncle  (Y) of  being aggressive with X's 10 yr old son. Now multiple people who all saw the incident say it was very playful and in no way violent/abusive. But X insists that it was and wants to take this to court and press charges on Y. This argument really blew up. And my mom decided it was time to confront X on his behaviors with me to end his hypocrisy and let him know that he needed to stop bullying members of the family. 

After she said it, I burst into tears. My whole family heard it. Now everyone knows. All my aunts and uncles. My younger cousins, my siblings. I can tell some of them are heartbroken for me. Others I think are in shock. By my aunt (X's wife) doesn't believe it even though he used to abuse her as well. I think she is the only member of the family who thinks I'm lying. I feel so embarrassed and I haven't stopped crying because I've had to relive the memories all day. I had buried them for over two years. I am typing this at work and I don't even want to go home because I am feeling so embarrassed. I don't know why I feel like ashamed. I have nothing to be ashamed about but I still feel it. I feel dirty and exposed and I don't think my life will ever be the same anymore. But the worst is that there's someone who doesn't believe it ever happened

TL;DR my uncle sexually abused me as a child. I kept it a secret and never told anyone. My mom had her suspicions. Today my family had a falling out and my mom brought up her suspicion to the whole family. I finally confirmed and most believe me but my aunt thinks I'm lying. Everyone knows now. I feel ashamed and dirty and I feel like i never want to see any of them again.

AITA for feeding my sons vegan friend meat?,"Hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, I'm not one to really do this but I'm genuinely wondering if I'm in the wrong.


So my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


I don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


Well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


Well, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


Well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no. So what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE: I write a pseudonymous blog. Someone posed as me and got a book deal. I've been ordered to hand over my website.,"[Previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5uzlut/i_write_a_pseudonymous_blog_someone_posed_as_me/)

Thank you for all the advice to my last post. I especially appreciate the supportive private messages I received from IT experts and fellow mommy bloggers.


As for the update, unfortunately this problem has become too complicated for me to fight and I've chosen to walk away. I know this does not make much sense at first, but there are many personal considerations that have gone into my decision.


In the comments to my last post, I alluded to being worried about the financial security of my family. What I did not mention is that much of this fear comes from the fact that my mother in law was recently diagnosed with a serious (though hopefully treatable) disease. My family and the families of my in-laws are helping her through this difficult period.

But the difficulties are more than financial. This has been a very emotionally trying time for my husband and my children. Prior to this legal problem, my husband and I had discussions about me reducing my blogging or stepping back entirely for a stretch. The amount of time it took to write for my blog is honestly time that I need to put towards supporting my family right now.

So one consideration in my decision to not pursue a legal fight was the money and (more importantly) the time it would take. Although my husband and I figured the money would work itself out, especially if our case was as strong as everyone here said it was.

But the real reason I decided not to fight the publisher is this: I wrote things on my blog about my in-laws (including my MIL) under the assumption that I was writing anonymously. I was never mean, but I did state some difficult truths about their behavior and unintentional emotional manipulation. 

We came to the conclusion that any effort to fight the publisher carried with it too great a risk that I would be outed publicly as the author of the blog. Given that emotions are running high now that we are all caring for my MIL, it would be devastating if my in-laws  became aware of my writing. This concern settled the issue for us.

The publisher filed a DMCA complaint against my blog. Thanks to the advice of everyone here, I made a backup of all my writing for myself. Strangely enough, a (very poorly formatted) archive of old posts also appeared on the new blog run by the impostor and the publisher. It looks like they just used copy and paste. I sent an email to the lawyers saying that while I was not conceding ownership of the blog or of my posts, I would not be fighting them at this time. They want me to sign some papers, but I have told them that I will not do that. They seem to have backed off.

Honestly, I am heartbroken to lose my blog, but I would be more heartbroken if it became something that would create a rupture in my family as we try to support my MIL. 

Thank you again to everyone. Hopefully somewhere down the road I can begin writing anew.

An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar,"The first mathematician orders a beer

""I don't serve half-beers"" the bartender replies

""Excuse me?"" Asks mathematician #2

""What kind of bar serves half-beers?"" The bartender remarks. ""That's ridiculous.""

""Oh c'mon"" says mathematician #1 ""do you know how hard it is to collect an infinite number of us? Just play along""

""There are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.""

""But that's not a problem"" mathematician #3 chimes in ""at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-""

""I know how limits work"" interjects the bartender

""Oh, alright then. I didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics""

""Are you kidding me?"" The bartender replies, ""you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?""

""HE'S ON TO US"" mathematician #1 screeches

Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.

The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. ""FOOLS"" it booms in unison, ""I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA""

The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. ""But wait"" he inturrupts, thinking fast, ""if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!""

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!"" and with that, they vanish.

A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. ""How did you know that that would work?""

""It's simple really"" the bartender says. ""I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.""",Jokes

UPDATE My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion,"Yesterday I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because I didn't have ""ThrowRA"". I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**ORIGINAL** 

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""I'm pregnant.""

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**UPDATE**

So today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

After the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   
I wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \[daughter's name\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else. 

Now I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

My daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.

TIFU by getting my whole family mega high on edibles for 48 hours over CHRISTMAS,"So as the title says this wasn't today, it all started on Christmas Eve. I'll set the scene, it's Christmas Eve at my family home with my parents, brother, sister, my gf and my brothers gf. All of us are in our early 20s, besides my parents who are mid 50s. They have never had a problem with us smoking weed and would do it with us on occasion. A few months before, me and my gf had made a batch of edibles and got pretty high off them but nothing too crazy. So on Christmas Eve I thought it would be a great idea to make a new batch of similar strength and get the whole family high as we are rarely all together as all us kids are at different universities. 

So I start making the edibles but I can't remember exactly how much weed I used in the first batch. I had 6 grams on me and used it all as there was 7 of us so nothing too crazy, or so I thought. Now when we made the first batch me and my gf cut the brownies into 12 pieces and only ever had 1 at a time. However my mum has a fancy brownie maker which cuts them for you into 9 pieces. So straight away I knew these would be a bit stronger than before but still I didn't think they would be that strong, boy was I wrong. So I finish baking the brownies at around 2pm on Christmas Eve and the family descends on them like a plague of locusts. 

Half an hour goes by and no one is feeling anything. Mum is just about to serve up dinner, we had it early as we knew no one would be able to make it later. We sit down to start eating and then one by one we start to feel it. My dad, who has a history of passing out after smoking weed, finished his dinner in a matter of seconds and crawls off to the sofa as he ""can't stand up"" and needs to ""lie down"". So off he goes and about 15 minutes later we finish our dinner and go to see where he has got too. We walk into our lounge to discover him already asleep on the sofa. So about 20 more minutes go by and we are all feeling pretty high at this point. My mum starts freaking out and saying she ""doesn't like this at all"" and needs some way to stop the high. I tell her that there is no way to stop it and to just ride it out. 

After about another 30 minutes my dad suddenly gets up from the sofa like he's the Undertaker and dashed off to the kitchen as he ""needs more food"". He then proceeds to make about 15 slices of toast for everyone to eat as well as about 5 for himself. At this point we realise that no one has wrapped any presents yet and my 85 year old grandmother is coming round for Christmas tomorrow. So we hastily try to wrap some presents but no one really gets anything done as by this point no one can even stand up anymore. 
Now me and my brother are seasoned stoners but even we can't move more than 2 steps before falling to the floor and needing 15 minutes rest to get up again. We decide that the only thing we can do is to try and sleep it off and hopefully we feel better in the morning. So after a while of all 7 of us struggling up the stairs we finally make it into our beds and try to sleep it off. 
We all wake up on Christmas Day still whacked out of our minds and not able to function properly. We then realise that we have to go and pick up my brothers friend up who is joining us for Christmas but none of us are in any state to drive. So, after explaining to my grandmother that none of us can drive to pick up the friend as we are all too high to move, we had to call an Uber to bring the friend to us which cost a small fortune as it was Christmas as he was about 25 miles away. So we soldier on through Christmas all of us trying to just not be high anymore and we finally make it to the end of the day still high as a kite. 

We go to sleep and wake up the next stay and guess what, we're still high as fuck. I genuinely thought it would never end but eventually later that day we all started coming back down to planet earth. So yeah, I ruined Christmas by getting my whole family too high to move.

Update: People are asking for more things that happened so I'll share a few with you. As I replied to one comment my mum was answering the TV every time someone on the TV asked a question.

This next one needs a little context. In our kitchen we have an aga. This is basically a fancy oven that is always on as a way to heat up the house. I never use it as the temperature isn't consistent and I always burn anything that I put in it. This is because I don't know what temperature it is and my mum always says it's around 200 degrees Celsius. My mum always has a go at me whenever I use the regular oven as it's ""wasteful"". With that out the way I'll get to the funny bit. This was right before mum served up dinner. She got the Yorkshire puddings out of the aga and they were completely burnt. I ask why they are burnt if she knows the temperature and she looks me dead in the eye and says ""I have no idea what the temperature of the aga is"". This was enough to send us both into fits of laughter for about 5 minutes.

Update 2: Thank you for the gold kind stranger! 

Update 3: For those saying this story isn't true I can 100% guarantee that it is. 

Update 4: Wow my first Platinum! Thank you so much!

I found a weird note on my windshield,"So this morning I found an envelope on my windshield, under the wiper. I thought that it was some kind of a fine but I've never got fined before (been living in my house since 04), plus the envelope had no text or stamp on it. Opened it and found a weird note inside with a bunch of numbers written with pencil. I have no idea what this is about but the next house is like 100 meters away from mine so I don't think that somebody simply mixed up the addresses or the cars.

Husband's Co-Worker,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years and together for 16. We are high school sweethearts. We just had our first child in August this year. I am 32 and he is 34. 

My husband works full time as a pharmacist, and I work at the power board. We have a great relationship, and rarely argue. He is my best friend. 

He took a position at a 24 hour Pharmacy as a staff pharmacist to train for a management position in 2015. This is one of the busiest pharmacies in our area. There are 15 technicians and 5 pharmacists including him at this location. They hired a new tech there that I will call Jane. She is 24 and married with 3 kids. I think she may have gotten pregnant with her third child after working there. Anyway she was a hard worker and my husband got along just fine with her and everyone there. 

However, she started texting him about work related things when he wasn't at work and started calling him Bossman. I was annoyed by her calling him that but I let it go. 

When I would go visit my husband at his work, she was always always overly complimentary to me. Telling me I was the cutest pregnant person ever, etc. I didn't think much of that as that is not my personality type but each to their own. She added me as a friend on Facebook and I accepted. I am friends with multiple coworkers of my husband both male and female. 

She began telling my husband about her marital problems. That she thought her husband was cheating on her, etc. She also wanted him to pick her up and take her to work when the weather was bad, she had car trouble, and other reasons. Now the current pharmacy manager does all this, so my husband didn't see an issue with it. So he picked her up a few times when the weather was bad. 

Fast forward to May of this year, my husband gets promoted to pharmacy manager and Jane wants to transfer to his store. She picks up all the extra shifts there. I'm still pregnant with my daughter and this point, and so I go see him one night. She straight up avoids me. I try to speak to her to be nice and she ignores me. So I ask my husband, he shrugs and says he don't know. 

The texts start increasing and it's more non work related stuff than work related stuff. She starts tagging him in things on Facebook and I am uncomfortable with it. So I tell him to put a stop to it. The final straw is she asks my husband to pick her up at a car dealership and take her to work since her car is being serviced. Keep in mind that her husband works at the dealership where her car is being serviced and they have a vehicle each. That's when I lost it and put my foot down. 

Well she no longer wanted to transfer to his pharmacy after he told her the texts and asking for rides had to stop. She basically went silent. I was still fuming and friends with her on Facebook so I posted a meme and she deleted me. She did not block me just deleted me. 

She told everyone at work that I didn't like her and she just didn't understand why and she wasn't transferring to his store anymore because my husband didn't like her. 

My husband had to go back to the store she works at to take care of something and he didn't speak to her, she went to a coworker and was on the verge of tears because my husband didn't speak to her. 

So anyway she gets a new job at the hospital and leaves the pharmacy. I'm so glad to be done with her and the fact my husband will never see her again until she tells another coworker at that Walgreens who I am very good friends with that she is coming back on 1/10/19 because she doesn't make enough money at the hospital and has filed for divorce from her husband. I'm not too upset by this. He rarely ever has to go to that store and will never see her. 

Well on Friday we got news he is going to be promoted to manager of that store and his first day there will be around the time that Jane starts back working there. I trust my husband completely but I just don't know how to handle this situation.  They will be working together every day. 

Now I realize that a lot of this stuff happened while I was pregnant and hormonal but I just have a bad feeling about all of it. 

Any advice is appreciated, and I'm so sorry for the long read. ",relationship_advice

My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,"My wife and I are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

When I was in my 20s I donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (I literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). I've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. Always. And she has always said she's okay with it.

Fast forward to yesterday I answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" Obviously I have no idea what the fuck is going on, so I ask her to explain what she's talking about.

Turns out this girl is my daughter (I understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when I didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. After turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. She called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. Apparently my wife told her that I wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

Honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman I loved could be so fucking heartless. So for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when I was home.

I tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that I did not say any of that. We organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night I blew up at her. Honestly, I've NEVER yelled at anyone as long as I can remember, but I couldn't hold it in.

AITA for calling the police/CPS on my SIL?,"Going to try to make this as short as possible while including details needed. 

I have been with my fiancé for 6 years. Fiancé has an older sister, we'll call her Sally, who is 28 and has a 5 year old child. I was there the day Sally was in labor and Baby was born, she is my niece. His entire family has referred to me as his Auntie since day 1. I am not blood but we are family, she calls me Auntie and we have sleepovers, zoo visits, etc. 

2 years ago Sally was in rehab from drug addiction. Alcohol, pain killers, and Xanax were her thing. She had a mental breakdown and the family collected money to send her to rehab and all organized a schedule to take care of Baby. The baby's dad, Sally's boyfriend, has a welding/construction job and was out of town for 2 months so he wasn't there for all of this. 

She checked herself out after 3 days, insisting she was ""fine and just needed a safe withdraw"". I pick her up, take her to her house, and she immediately goes to smoke weed and drink a beer. I don't think weed is a drug and am very pro-cannibas although I don't smoke, but that was not appropriate considering I just picked her up from rehab. 

A week later she was fired for snorting in the bathroom., evicted for being 4 months late, totaled her car driving while high and is being sued for $50k from wrecking into a house, and was kicked out of Fiancé's other sister's house for forgetting the sink was plugged up and running (she was high) and the entire downstairs was RUINED from water damage because nobody else came home for 8 hours. $20,000 of damage and thank god their house insurance covered it. 

That was all last year. They've been in their new house on their own for about 6 months. In November she called FIL and said their electricity was shut off because she didn't have the money because BF's paycheck got messed up and didn't go through. He paid their late electricity bills.. a total of $500. I thought it was suspiciously expensive but kept my mouth shut. All has been quiet since. 

Two weeks ago, she asked me to borrow some money to get groceries for Niece. Of course I'm not going to let my niece or sister go hungry, no matter what is going on otherwise, so I say I'll be over at 5. I got off work early and get there at 2:45. I come in using my spare key, walk in, see Niece playing with dolls in the corner, Sally passed out on the couch, and heroin on the coffee table. Unfortunately coming from a family riddled with addiction, I know what heroin looks like. I don't know how much it was, but I could have scooped it up and filled my palm with it. I noticed radiators everywhere in the front room and Niece was in multiple layers of clothes and her winter jacket. The heat was off. The house was maybe 40F - it was 30 outside. 

I took Niece to my car, and called 911 for an ambulance as I was scared Sally was overdosing.  I didn't want to alarm and freak out Niece so I stayed in the car and let her play on my phone until the ambulance arrived. Of course police and CPS showed up as well. I explained the situation and because Niece's dad is out of town working, FIL/MIL were called. When they arrived they were quiet and cold, didn't really talk, took Niece, and told me to go home. 

An hour later I get home and fiancé asks me what I've done. I explained everything to him and all he had was anger for me. Apparently the entire family already knew and were pissed at me for what I had done. Apparently I was ""out of line and stupid"" because I called 911 before seeing if she was actually OD'ing because it turned out she was just nodding out from the heroin. We fought for hours and I left and spent the night at my best friend's house and cried all night. I couldn't handle it all so I turned my phone off and tried to relax and just calm down. My best friend was up all night with me, telling me I did nothing wrong, and I'm okay. 

I turn my phone on and I had 65 texts/messages. MIL, FIL, SIL, fiancé, and their extended family members blaming me. They are saying I ruined her life, ruined Niece's life, made everything more complicated than it needed to be, made it public when it was a ""family affair"", and ruined Sally's chances of ever getting cleaned or having custody of her child again, none of them ever want to see me again and I will never see my niece again, and they want me to pay for Sally's jail bond and sue me for the CPS case and emotional damages.

I am also now single. So on top of losing my best friend of 10 years (fiancé), I will lose my apartment I had with him, what I considered my family, and my Niece.

I truly feel horrible. I have horrible anxiety to the point where I'm worried someone is going to come get ""revenge"" on me for what I did. I can't eat. I have lost 7 pounds from it. I'm not sleeping for shit. I have bags under my eyes. I've had 8 migraine-days in two weeks. At first I felt so confident in my decision but as the days go by I'm thinking maybe they were right and I should have checked on her before calling 911 and being frazzled. I don't care about Sally anymore, but I did rip a 5 year old child away from her parents and I feel horrible about it. I know someone in the family will take her in, but it's never like being with your parents. She will grow up resenting me for it and all I've ever done is love her as my own.

I (24M) think I may have been raped by male friend (25M).,"I was too afraid and ashamed to share this by my regular account, but after seeing so many confessions I thought I had nothing left to lose, people have already made fun of me for thinking something like this could have happened. Even I am not exactly sure it did. I have had panic attacks ever since that day at just the possibility of this being true. I will try to include all the relevant events that took place to the best of my recollection without letting my feelings get the better of me again.

Anyway, here goes. I live in the same apartment with a roommate (25M). I've known him for almost a trimester and I'd consider him a friend. We are straight and with girlfriends, for what it's worth. The last few weeks we've had a rocky relationship but the most we've done is yell at each other for stuff and we always made up afterwards. He hasn't displayed troubling behavior for the most part but at times I've caught him staring oddly and he's made plenty of rape jokes which most of the friend group finds distasteful.

2 weeks ago a mutual friend of ours was celebrating his birthday and we were both invited. I don't remember drinking too much, but I have a memory gap extending to around 12 hours and I have no recollection of what happened during it. When I woke up I felt like I had been sleeping for centuries and every limb of mine was heavy and numb. I had difficulty sitting down, my back was aching and my muscles were sore.

After I managed to get up and look in the mirror I noticed, to my horror, that I had bruises on my abdomen and chest. I asked my roommate about it and told me I was so drunk last night that I had gotten into a fight over something stupid. This would explain most of the symptoms so I believed him.

The reason I say ""most of"" and not all symptoms is because I experienced discomfort when using the toilet and nightmares at night (which I never did in the past). I don't think a bar fight causes these.

Then I found out from the birthday boy himself that said bar fight never happened, or at least he doesn't remember it happening (to be fair he was pretty drunk too). He told me that I got wasted, slept on the chair and my roommate with another friend of ours carried me home.

I asked the other friend who carried me home with my roommate and he told me that they brought me to the apartment, got me on the bed and then he left. I asked him specifically whether they accidentally dropped me and I hit the floor which would explain the bruises but he told me that I never fell nor did they drop me.

A few days ago it dawned on me that we were buying rounds before I got the memory gap. I don't remember whether I specifically had a drink chosen for me or if I took a random one out of a disc but a sleeping substance would explain why I suddenly fell unconscious for so many hours and so suddenly.

I try to think of it more along the lines of a ""what if"" scenario rather than something certain because my life would be absolutely ruined if something like this happened. I don't know if I'd be able to survive it. Still, the nightmares continue and I've been crying during sex with my girlfriend, something I was thankfully able to hide, but this fear is increasingly growing inside of me.

Please don't tell me to call the police or anything like that, I'm not even sure I want to know and even if I do, I certainly wouldn't want the rest of the world to ever find out. I'm comfortable to share it with strangers on the internet, but nothing more than that. I took a week off to return to my family and stay with them until I get my thoughts in order.

Could my hunch be wrong? I could have had a bar fight and maybe nobody remembers because we were all drunk, and I could have nightmares because I'm trying to self-impose on myself that I was raped. That's possible, right? What would you do in my shoes?

**Tl;dr** I think roommate drugged me, raped me and lied about it, but I can't be sure, I feel terrible and I want to crawl into a corner and never leave it ever again.

**UPDATE:** Thank you for the encouraging words. There is a symptom I was too embarrassed to mention originally, but anonymity is a powerful thing. I had rectal bleeding the first time I use the bathroom after the event, along with a sense of discomfort. Also, my roommate has made jokes about roofying women before, on multiple occasions, for example about an unhelpful airport assistant.

**UPDATE #2:** Thank you all for your comments. I wish I could reply to each and every one of you seperately, you are really making a difference because you're the only ones I've shared this with so far. I was in a very dark place yesterday but now I'm trying to make sense of it all.

So I went to a doctor. I told her everything and she wanted to check my body and also examine me from behind. She told me that I had some tearings and small cuts/scratches that could signify sexual abuse, but since it is 8 days later already more than likely none of it can be conclusive evidence. For what it's worth she told me my mental state and physical symptoms seem suggestive of abuse...At least now I know that it was not all in my head.

She also drew some blood because I mainly wanted to get tested for STDs. Now I'm waiting, praying for the better. Hopefully even if that event did happen I won't get or transmit anything to anyone I wouldn't want to. I'm also planning on what to do with that fucking scum. I think I'll return and act normal just as long as I can search his room for evidence. Not sure what I'd even do with it, but I'm taking things one step at a time.",relationship_advice
TIFU during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student,"
I'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. In this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. If you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. As this was my first laparoscopic surgery, I soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. Like many of you, I had no idea this role even existed, but I quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. I approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. I placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. After several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  The attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? Get that stopper out of her ass!""

Thank you for reading. I'll go die now. 

TL;DR  couldn't see under the sterile drapes when placing a rubber stopper in the vagina during surgery and accidentally placed it in the rectum",tifu
My(39m) daughter (17f) wants me to sleep in her room because she broke up but I suspect something mire to it.,"Edit: The title should be more to it not mire.

I know this is actually a really weird situation. I'm sorry I do my best to raise her but I know that I can never fill the void her mother left when she passed away.

Yesterday out of the blue, my daughter asked me to sleep in her room. When I asked her if everything was alright she started crying and told me that she broke up with her boyfriend and she didn't want to talk about it. She told me she doesn't fesl safe anymore. 

I just didn't push the issue and slept in her room. She didn't want to talk today either. I think something's really wrong, because we are super close and she tells me everything but reluctant to talk about this. What do I do?

Update:  Hey guys I sincerely thank everyone here for showing their support and giving me some much needed advice. I just wanted to update this. So, my sister came over and took her out so they can have some alone time together. It turns out that she broke up with her boyfriend because he's been cheating on her.

"[UPDATE] [PA] I followed and reported a drunk driver, then I got a ticket for driving past curfew","This is an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!",legaladvice

TIFU by thinking divorce was an April Fools Gag,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

TIFU when my husband walked in on me naked with 7 emergency service men,"I'm 6 months pregnant, barely showing and randomly woke up one day last week unable to move. At first, I'm terrified that I'm paralysed. Then I realise it's really severe sciatic pain and I genuinely cannot walk/get up or really breathe too deeply.

I have no signal in my room but I DO have WiFi, so I call my husband who calls emergency services for me. Within 20 minutes, 2 firefighters turn up knocking on the door. My husband is a good hour or more away still and they have to break into a window in the bedroom (big french windows). They try to move me, realise they can't and call another two firefighters from the truck outside. Even with four of them trying to gently move me up and off the bed, it's not possible. I am in just too much pain and screaming every time they try. They also have no medication. 

My cleaner turns up. Idiot me forgot she was due and I could've saved the window, oh well. FU number one. 

In my area, there is a shortage of ambulances so firefighters get called first. They decide we need to wait for the doctor. The doctor takes around an hour to arrive and brings 2 colleagues. They can't numb me, because I'm pregnant and it is only achievable to move me by extremely slowly moving me bit by bit.

Of course, at this moment my husband arrives, with an extremely puzzled expression, walking through the smashed french doors. I am at first confused, why does he look so befuddled by this situation, starring his ailing wife? 

Oh, yes, probably because I am absolutely buck naked as I cannot move to get dressed, legs akimbo as they are being slowly moved one by one into a better position, surrounded by 7 not unattractive tall German men, 2 of whom are *actively holding my legs open to help me*. It slowly dawns on me I am basically in a porno. And this suddenly becomes really fucking funny to me, so I laugh. And as I laugh, the pain goes all the way from my left big toe to my right middle finger like an electric shock and I pass out. FU NUMBER 2. My final image of this scene was my poor cleaner giving me a sympathetic look from the inner doorway and trying not to cross herself looking at my naked state of being. Deeply catholic woman. I would rather my entire family see me like this than her. 

Turns out later, when I come to, I've really caused my back quite some problems by passing out in this delicate position and I'll be bed-ridden for a few weeks. Without decent pain medication because of my developing crotch goblin. I bet the emergency service workers are going to get some mileage out of this one.

TL;DR Thought I was paralysed, emergency services had to move me naked, husband walks in and observed 7 men tending to his naked wife, I laugh and do more damage than was there in the first place. 

Edit: some people asking why I didn't get covered with a blanket. I'd guess in the half sitting half lying position I was in, a blanket would have slipped off and been really inconvenient for the doctor having to delicately move me. I didn't even notice my nakedness until husband showed up, the pain was way worse than the embarrassment. ",tifu
TIFU by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina,"12 hours before my first ""grown up job"" interview, I was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company's grounds. Considering I smoke weed daily I started looking up ways to pass a drug test. I came to the conclusion that I was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. I had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they're just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

Unfortunately I was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time I had to prepare, but knowing that I wouldn't be able to pass if the temperature wasn't correct I had the idea to stick it up my vagina. I tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so I could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

Fast forward to the interview.
It was an hour and a half away so I decided to wait till I got there to insert it. I did it in my car w some coconut oil before I walked in just Incase they decided to drug test me first. I walked in and everything was fine, I signed in and they told me to take a seat. As soon as I sat down I knew something was wrong. I went to the bathroom to make sure I could still take it out. I began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn't move. I tugged again and the string broke. At this point I'm freaking out. I try getting it out with my fingers but I can't reach it. The only ""tools"" I have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. So in a 3 piece suit and heels, I squat and begin to use these ""tools"" to try and remove the bottle. About 4 min go by and I'm really freaking out but need to go back Incase they called my name. I walk out and the HR rep sees me and asks if I'm okay. I tell her I have a tampon stuck up my vagina that I can't get out and that's why I'm freaking out. She then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! Not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, I ask her if I can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. Obviously that didn't work. So she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... Still didn't work. At this point I just have to do the interview. It lasted 3 hours and I had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

When the interview finally ends I rush to the closest urgent care where I have to explain to the doctors why there's a 5 hour energy in my vagina. At this point I'm convinced I just don't have the right tools and they'll get it out in no time. Upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it's also sideways. Her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle IN MY VAGINA and then fish it out. ~Luckily~ they just sent me to the ER instead. 

So now I'm at the ER where they then inform me that since it's behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since I wasn't actually giving birth my body wasn't dilated and they couldn't remove the bottle without putting me under.  

Well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.
I didn't get the job and I didn't even get drug tested. 

TLDR: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. After 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the ER it was finally removed

Edit: this isn't made up. Idk if I have all the ""anatomy"" right I guess? Yes it was very painful. Yes, I have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don't believe me

I'm just telling you guys what the doctors told me. They might have just told me a dumbed down version without the right medicinal terminology, idk

What is the legal definition of a sandwich?,"Certain unscrupulous individuals that I am aquatinted with have recently asserted that in some jurisdictions (namely New York)  Burritos are Sandwiches. 

This is clearly a scurrilous lie.

Thus I ask you good people of Reddit, what is the legal definition of a Sandwich?

I have provided this [handy chart](http://imgur.com/5yzsKJ5) for reference purposes.

Edit: at the request of /u/foxhunter I am changing the location to Tennessee. It's a race for gold people.

Edit 2:

Full definition given by /u/JustSomeBadAdvice

Here is an attempt at a definition that includes all things commonly referred to or thought of as ""a sandwich"" and excludes all things not commonly thought of as sandwiches.

First two definitions to help:

 • Bread: A ""bread"" in this parlance refers to any grain-based dough that has been baked either by itself or with other ingredients added to it that do not constitute the sandwich ""filling.""

 • Filling: Any ingredient or ingredients normally eaten by human beings that is used to differentiate between ""two pieces of bread"" and a sandwich.

** Bread may be made of corn instead of grain if corn is merely substituted for grain using a grain-based dough receipe.

And now the definition:

 1. A sandwich is a single piece of bread or two pieces of bread(of roughly equal size) that and surrounds a filling on both the top and bottom as it is eaten, where the bottom of the sandwich is gripped by thumb(s) and the top is gripped by finger(s).

 2. The bread must have been baked prior to being combined with the filling(i.e., no Calzones)

 3. Where the sandwich is one (rather than two) pieces of bread, the filling must be typically found in two-bread sandwiches in the same form. (I.e., no burritos)

 4. Where substituted as a low-carb option, lettuce can be substituted for bread provided nothing else is changed and filling is the same as is typically found in two-bread sandwiches.

Things included in definition:

 1. Grilled Cheese Sandwiches

 2. PB&J sandwiches

 3. Submarine sandwiches

 4. Ice cream sandwiches

 5. Meat, cheese, and cracker sandwich

 6. Wraps, flatbread sandwiches, pita wraps, and gyro's (when eaten as one).

 7. Hotdogs when consumed by turning them on their side and eaten as a sandwich.

 8. Melts and Panini's

 9. Chicken salad sandwiches and tuna sandwiches.

 10. BLT sandwiches.

 11. Lettuce wraps aka unwiches when folded and eaten as sandwiches.

 12. Sloppy Joe's

 13. Quesadilla's if eaten as a sandwich.

 14. Oreo cookies and other sandwich cookies, if the cookies were baked prior to joining the filling

Things not included in definition:

 1. Tacos(how eaten)

 2. Burritos (Rule #3)

 3. Calzones (prior baking)

 4. Poptarts (prior baking)

 5. Salads (improper bread).

 6. Ravioli (Prior baking, how eaten)

 7. Chicken wings(fucking colorado) and fried foods. (how eaten, one or two pieces of bread)

 8. Pizza (bread surrounding, how eaten, prior baking)

 9. The double down is not a sandwich. It is the shame of the U.S. (And the pride of 'Murica).

 10. Burger bowls & taco salads. (how eaten)

 11. Stuffed Grape Leaves(rule 4)

 12. Chili in a bread bowl(how eaten)

 13. Dumplings(prior baking)

 14. Uncrustables(prior baking)

 15. Pigs in a blanket(prior baking)

I have no idea who created the term ""open faced sandwich"" but it is an abomination. It is either ""X on Y"" or ""X and Y"" ala Bagel & Cream Cheese or Buttered Toast or eggs on toast.

I was unable to exclude quesadillas without also excluding other things that are functionally identical to sandwiches(Wraps/grilled cheese), and I was unable to include uncrustables without also including calzones.

Public North Carolina High School. Says my son's hairstyle and color violates school's social norms. (Update: Found a way around it),"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/789wcm/public_north_carolina_high_school_says_my_sons/

I want to you all for the help and advice that you gave us. I realized that this, while stupid, is probably within the rights of the school. But that didn't mean there was nothing we could do. A lot of you brought up the idea of a using a wig. Sadly, wigs also weren't allowed except for ""legitimate religious, cultural or medical reasons with prior approval.""

However, what did surprise me was that there were two girls who were on a green dye for months without a problem. This definitely sounded like gender discrimination. Allowing that dye for girls and not boys. So I went in there to speak with the principal again, I told him that I'm recording the conversation and after speaking about wigs, told him that they're allowing girls to do that but not boys. Principal said this is a matter of judgement because unnatural hair colors doesn't diminish the feminine attributes of women, but unnatural hair colors for men does diminish their masculine attributes. I got it then, that nonsense is all this has been about. They think a long and blue hair on a boy isn't manly enough.

I reminded him that this is gender discrimination and gender is a protected class. He remained silent for more than a minute, I expected him to say it's fine and they'll backtrack but I was shocked when he told me that I'm right, they'll reinforce this requirement for girls too. ""It's best to get rid of these unnatural colors from our school.""

I hate what I did. The last thing I wanted was to cause trouble for those girls or start a chain of actions that could have ended up with them being forced to change their favorite hairstyles. They were contacted too, and were given the same choice.

Two days later my son came to me and said he's spoken with the girls and they have a solution. They want to dye their hair a very white silverish color. It's naturally occurring because you get it when you get old, and some people are born with it as well. I know the more mature thing would have been to tell him to end this game, but I was a teenager once as well and I was even more stubbern than he is now. So I allowed it.

The school didn't like it. The three of them were called to the principal's office where they argued their case that their hair color is naturally occurring now. They said it's the same color as one of the teachers who is quite old, ""are you gonna suspend Mr. X as well over his hair color?""

The principal laughed at them and backed off. It's been a couple of weeks since then and there hasn't been any issues. And this new color looks good on my son.

Judging people by their looks works well for the vast majority of cases.,"So here's the thing: Looks are not something that just randomly fell into place or whatever, but they are to a large part the result of choices and efforts made. For example, if you are well kept and wear a professional outfit, you're probably someone that cares a lot about impressions and your career, and most likely you have a fairly conservative outlook on life. Equally, if you look like a stoner or like you don't care about your looks, then that also says something about your values and beliefs. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's just obvious. If you are a woman, cut your hair short, and dye it three different colors, it's also not too hard to guess your political leanings. Same for someone running around in polo shirts and boat shoes only.

In the vast majority of cases, going by the initial impression leads to fairly good results. No, looks don't mean everything, and yes, I am aware of the halo effect, but really this ""Don't judge a book by its cover!"" nonsense needs to stop.",unpopularopinion

"AITA for ""allowing"" my 16yo daughter to get a tattoo?","My daughter is 16, and will be 17 in August.  In September, I'm going to move her across the country because she will be starting College at a very good school (she skipped a grade, graduated HS a year earlier than her peers).  

&#x200B;

Last week my daughter graduated HS.  We packed up her room (the essentials) from her Mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her College dorm.  A few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend Tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  I was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. It was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. We stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  The next day we went to Tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  I've known Tony since High School, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  I completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  He even did MY first tattoo when WE were in High School.  The entire experience was actually a blast for me.  I haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  To see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200B;

Of course the next day she posts pics online, and her Mom flips her shit.  She calls me screaming about how irresponsible I am.  I honestly didn't know her Mom wouldn't be OK with it.  She has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about Daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and I'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  She's also cut me out of multiple milestones in Daughter's life.  Graduations, performances, games, etc.  Until Daughter was old enough to tell me directly, I was never invited so I missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200B;

Obviously Daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""I'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  I definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  Wife has been OK with her having sex since 13, picked her own High School and College, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  Why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  Would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  

&#x200B;

Mom is livid.  She threatened to call the police.  Threatened to pick up Daughter and bring her back to her house.  Tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  None of this is happening.  A culture was created in which I don't get input on things regarding Daughter.  A culture was created in which Mom allowed Daughter to make decisions for herself.

TIFU by peeing in a girls mouth thinking i was ejaculating.,"Me and this girl met up after ages of speaking on snapchat (about 6 months), with the whole intent to have sex. 

&#x200B;

She gets to my house and we talk for a bit and things are going well, Things go to things and were kissing, then sex, you know the usual. After a few struggles of putting on a condom (never had used one before) i was able to fuck her and it went well. I came and threw the condom in the bin. 

&#x200B;

This is where it gets fucked, shes sucking on my dick, i feel as if im about to cum again, thinking to myself thats kind of weird because i dont usually cum is such quick succession but i go along with it. I feel as if im about to do it and end up what i think is ejaculating in her mouth. I could not be anymore wrong.  


I ended up peeing in her mouth for a few seconds, she swallowed that, and then took my dick out thinking i was done, pee shot out of my dick on her boobs, she realised, i realised, i panicked so hard and immediately got her into my shower taking off the rest of her clothes.

&#x200B;

Grabbed a towel and made her drink some mouthwash and gave her a glass of water, i was on my feet the whole time and she wasnt even making a big deal about it, i felt like utter shit

&#x200B;

In the end she said the sex was good and that she heard about times her friends had that happen to her, told her i'd go to the toilet before fucking next time, and we are all good now.

"I (28M) wrongly accused my gf (24F) of cheating, don't know how to move forward.","Basically my (28M) girlfriend (24F) was acting shady. 
By shady I mean that she was on her phone a lot, making phone calls and I saw payments from her card for events and things I wasn't doing with her. 

I waited it out a week or two and the weirdness continued. She fell asleep and I went through her phone and found bookings for a hotel at the weekend in a city a while away and tickets for some sporting event on that weekend. 

I woke her up and shoved the phone at her, demanding she explain. She looked distraught and said ""do you really think I'd do that?"" And began to cry. She then told me to look at the bookings properly and when I did my heart sank. 

We rarely get time off together and she had booked me the weekend off through my boss as a suprise, booked a hotel in the city I said I wanted to visit and it just so happened my team were playing in that city that weekend so she'd spent a good amount on tickets. She'd also booked a table at my favourite restaurant. 

I instantly realised how stupid I'd been and I can't believe my first thought was that she would betray me when she's given me no reason to distrust her. It's kinda tainted the suprise weekend and she's so disheartened. I've tried to apologise but she's just shut off from me and is so hurt by my assumptions.

TIFU and almost died in the most hilarious way possible,"Not today as per usual. But 18 years ago.

I had moved to California a few years earlier. A few blocks away was a grocery store. In that store was a toy section. Back then. 1998? It just had an assortment of coloring books and some ""squeaky"" toys. Rubber animals you would squeeze to make a noise. I would grab the ""squeak"" thing from those toys. They are the size of a pill or vitamin. If I placed it in my mouth and pulled it to the back I could talk while making a stupid noise. One time heading back to my friends after grabbing a fresh squeaker I accidentally chortle\ snorted and inhaled the thing. I'm behind the store now ready to hop the stone wall back home. No one is around. Nor will there be til the trash is dropped at end of night. So I'm choking. But instead of a gasp its a loud squeak. Reeeeeet, ruuuuuh. I'm grasping at my chest. Reereet, ruuuh. My vision fades and a fall down on my back. This dislodges the squeaker with one more loud REET. After a moment on the ground I get up and go home. Deciding I'll never take a squeaker again.

TIFU by asking my bfs mom to read my text while I was driving,"Obligatory; this happened a couple weeks ago. 

TL;DR at bottom

Some background of the story is my boyfriend sold his RV to a lovely family he met on some place like Facebook market. He forgot that the vehicle actually had 2 keys that go to it and he only gave them one key. He was at work so he was unable to give them the second key. He calls me in a panic because he had no idea where this key is so he asks me to find it and bring it to the people who bought his RV. 

I am uncomfortable meeting strangers on the internet so I asked his mother if she could go with me and I will give her a ride home as she does not drive. I didn't tell him she was going with me (important to the story later). 

He kept texting me and by the third text I thought there was something wrong or I needed to know. I asked his mom if she could read me what he said because I don't text and drive. 

She started reading his text ""omg thank you so much. Tonight I am going to get you off so hard your head will spin."" An awkward silence ensues and she broke it by saying ""ok then."" 

I asked her just to respond saying that she is texting so he would stop dirty texting to prevent further awkwardness. She responded by calling him his childhood nick name and saying ""this is your maternal figure. Your girlfriend is driving."" He responded with ""well this is super awkward.""

We laugh about it now, but never ever again am I letting people read my texts. If it is important enough they can call. 

TL;DR my boyfriend's mom and I were meeting with people who bought my boyfriend's RV to drop off another key to them. While I was driving I kept getting texts and asked his mom to read it to me. It was a dirty text that said ""thank you so much, I am going to get you off so hard your head will spin. "" His mom responded to let him know that she was with me.",tifu

I [27] think my dad [late 50s] is a pedofile and I've ruined my relationship with my sister [32] beyond repair.,"I don't know why I'm posting this, but I have to get this out and tell someone or I think I'm going to go certifiably insane. I can't sleep because this is keeping me up. 

The last few months its like a switch has been turned in my head. I'm getting fuzzy memories. I think they are memories at least. However they aren't clear and sort of feel like a dream at times. Part of me really hopes they aren't real. I think all started because my dad has repeatedly brought up my sex life with my husband on multiple occasions over the last few months. In really creepy and weird ways to where I'm fake laughing and trying my hardest to change the subject because my dad and I have never talked about sex. I'm 27 and married, I don't need a sex talk anymore, that ship has sailed. Him bringing it up at all, was just really out of place for our relationship and for some reason made me extreamly uncomfortable.

One memory is where I'm about 7 or 8. I'm home sick from school and in the garage with my dad helping him with stuff. I'm talking about a boy I like at school. My dad asks me if I've ever french kissed anyone. I'm confused and don't even know what that is. To put it lightly, he proceeds to teach me how to french kiss. 

Heres the thing though, I filled in a lot of blanks above. Its like peices are missing from my memory. I don't remember exactly how old I was but I remember, crystal clear, I was home sick because I had a test I didn't study for and faked not feeling well that morning. I also don't remember him kissing me, at all. I remember him asking if I had french kissed anyone pretty clear but after that its like the rest of the memory is gone. But somehow I *know* he taught me how to French kiss after he asked me that. I get a sense of feeling very uncomfortable whenever I get to that part of the memory. 

My sister is the black sheep in our family. She got pregnant in highschool, dropped out, got into drugs pretty bad, and has been in and out of rehab/mental institutions her whole life. Shes 5 years older then me. I tried helping her when I got old enough to get over my childhood mad-ness. My parents drilled it into me after she got pregnant and dropped out that she was the problem. I believed them for so long. Then I got older, got out of my parents house and realized life is not black and white. She wasn't a bad person, she was going through a bad time. I *tried*helping her. But she burned me too many times and eventually her lies and manipulation made me cut her out of my life. 

A few years ago she came out to everyone in my family saying my dad molested her. By this time I hadn't talked to her in years. My dad works a high profile job, an accusation like this would basically ruin his career. She had lied to me my whole young adult life about almost everything that it was easy for me to not believe her. I saw my dad as my hero, there was absolutely no thought in my mind that he could do the things she said he did. 

Until a few months ago. 

Another memory I have now is when I was younger, about 5 or 6, and its sort of like a ""this is how it always was"" kind of memory. Its not of a specific time but its like I'm re remembering something that was really common and happened a lot. My sister and I shared a room and at nap time she was always be in her bed next to mine when I fell asleep, but when I woke up she wouldn't be in the room. Whenever I'd go and find her she'd be dazed and not in a good mood. It makes sense. In her accusations she said he would always wake her up at nap time and they'd go to his bedroom. 

I don't know what to do. I didn't believe her. Part of me still doesn't want to believe her even though I know thats really fucked up. Ive not spoken to her in years. My whole outlook of my dad being my hero is tainted and smashed. I've been ignoring his calls these last few months, avoiding him. 

I ache for my sister. She must have went through something so tramatic and her way of dealing was the drugs. I know abuse can tear people up and cause so much mental illness problems. I feel horrible because I thought her crippling anxiety that caused her to loose every job I got her was her way of getting out of working when in reality it was her way of dealing with the abuse. I feel lucky that my mind somehow blocked it out and I really want the memories to stop because I feel like if they continue I'm going to be just as messed up as she was/is. 

I don't know what to do. Do I call her? Tell her I believe her? Do I apologize? Do I throw open the roof and accuse my dad? Or do I do what I really want to do and ignore all of this like it never happened. I know, fucked up, but I wish it never did. I don't want these memories. I miss my dad. I don't want to ruin his life by accusing him of anything that I'm personally not 100 percent sure of but I also don't want to let my sister continue to suffer and think no one believes her. And, my dad has always been very friendly to kids. Most people think hes just good with kids. But now, I think its because of this. I haven't been home in awhile, but if hes anything like he was when I was there he's making friends with the neighbor kids. If I don't say something am I forcing another kid to be abused? Was it just his own kids he did this to or did he move on to other kids when we grew up and moved out. I can't be sure of course but in the back of my head its like, I know he was too friendly to the kids in our neighborhood in light of my recent memories. It wasn't normal. 

I'm sorry that was so long. I can't tell anyone about this, I'm scared to even tell my husband because I know saying it out loud will make it all true. I know my husband would support me in anything I wanted to do, but telling him seems like this big chore that I keep putting off because I don't even know what I want to do. I'm not sure how to proceed here. I don't even have my sisters number, I don't even know what I would say. What if its too late and she doesn't care that I believe her. I've heard she's doing better and had been in a good place this last year, what if me bringing this up again hurts her progress? Maybe she's gotten past some of it and bringing it up will only hurt her? What if no one believes me like no one believed her? 

I feel like I'm just rambling and going on about what ifs at this point so I'm going to end here. I don't even know if reddit can help me with this. I know I need to see a professional but I'm scared to remember more and I'm scared to talk about this. 

Edit: It's been a rough morning. My husband knew something was off when he woke up. I told him. He agrees I need to see a professional which, with my insurance could take weeks due to needing a referral since I can't just go see one. Until then he thinks its a good idea to write down what I am remembering as I remember it. 

We've agreed not to tell my sister about this until I establish some sort of new relationship baseline. Her and I don't even know each other anymore and to jump right out with this, well it would be too much. I plan to reach out to her and slowly start talking again if shes willing. When the time is right, after I've talked to a professional, I'll bring it up to her and go from there. 

Thank you all for the advice. I think just writing this out helped me see what I needed to do.

My boyfriend expressed his rape fantasies after sleeping with me for the first time.,"Long time anon lurker, first time poster. I'm so utterly dumbfounded that I have no idea who to turn to.

Up until last night, I (21F) was a virgin. A late bloomer, I guess; I never had the time nor confidence to fool with it. I met my boyfriend (22M) seven months ago after signing up to my university's sign language society. We settled into a relationship about two months following that, so it was probably a little hasty in hindsight.

Things had been fine, and I'f been rendered utterly smitten. He's charming, well-kempt, and has been nothing short of understanding of my inexperience.

Last night, however, things took a really sharp turn. An evening spent on the wine had made us both a little comfortable and we went to bed together. I was initially happy to do so as everything leading up to that point had me convinced that he'd be gentle and thoughtful about it, but he wasn't. I was manhandled, pushed down, and he would insult me occasionally throughout the whole ordeal. I was tipsy and hurting, and at one point he even kept me held to the sheets by my neck when I tried to sit up. When he'd done, he left me until I'd almost fallen asleep, before rejoining me in bed. It hurt throughout the night, and I'm still really sore almost a full day later.

When I sobered up this morning, I asked him what went so wrong when he joined me in the dorm kitchen to get some water. He played it as though everything was fine, but I told him that I didn't feel fine. It's hard to pin how the conversation led, but he basically told me that one of his deepest fantasies was - in his words - ""defloration and conquest."" I was undeniably disturbed and basically blurted out the term rape fantasy. He got irate over this and described it as consensual non-consent. I became upset and removed myself from the kitchen when I heard my flatmate's door open, and I'm not sure what he did with himself following that.

I've not left my room since, and I've had an absolute flurry of messages from him that I can't bring myself to open. I feel dirty, and hurt, and stupid, and can't help but feel like I've been groomed as an object of this fucked fantasy of his.

I don't know where to go from here, or who to turn to. I'm desperately tempted to ghost him and just be done with it, but we each attend the same campus and its sign language class, of which I will likely quit.

I don't know if I'm overreacting and being too hard on him. I don't know if this is something I should raise, and if so, who to? I'm feeling god awfully irrational at this moment and wasn't sure where to express this, so here I am.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.",relationship_advice

Every single trip, he will have some wild caught, exotic, fancy, or otherwise intriguing catch. There will be a little barter, I'll probably buy it.

**Wednesday**

This day is no different, I walk in looking for some coley (great alternative to cod, please try it, sustainable), when the fishmonger is like ""ah my friend! Only the best for you? I have the special stock out back"" 

Of course I want the special stock.

So he goes out back, and brings back this little fella, beautifully blue, with just one antenna, he puts it on the table. It wiggles that little antenna at me... And in that moment, I decided that the lobster in front of me was special. I say that I'll decide if I want it tomorrow. 

I go home... distressed? I don't know why - but in those small moments I emotionally connected with a fucking lobster. I go on a panicked 2 hour frenzy (this is the middle of exam season, I should be revising) looking for tanks, looking up lobster information, trying to work out how I will hide a lobster in my room. Eventually I realise that there is no way of keeping this lobster. I try to find friends and family with tanks that have no fish, or someone that want's a pet lobster - nothing. I decide to purchase it, and try to find it a home, and if not, quickly put it down with a knife (instead of boiling, which I am confident, having read the scientific literature, causes a lobster distress and pain).

**Thursday**

*I feel at this point I should inform you that my confused girlfriend now knows I am getting a pet lobster*


Now before I go to the fishmongers, I head to the supermarket. I need supplies to transport the lobster; and if I have to put it down, it will have a nice meal before it dies.
I purchase the following

1) Sea salt

2) Ice

3) Salmon, Cod, Prawns, Broccoli, Carrots (stuff that the internet said lobsters like)

4) Tea towels

5) Apple juice (to help me with the emotional stress I'm currently in)

I go to pick it up, the fishmonger (ex-chef) asks if I want it boiled, I say no, and that I will cook it myself. He gives me seaweed to keep him comfy and hydrated in. I take it home. Turns out the lobster is male. I name him Qui-Gon because there's always a bigger lobster. I take apart my plastic drawers, and pop him in one of them. Along with the sea weed and food. I play some underwater sounds I downloaded on my phone. I take pictures and post pictures of him on pet sites on facebook looking for a home and/or a tank - my third plan, was now to house him at my parent's home. 

*At this point my family knows I own a pet lobster*

Oh, I have a 24 hour bug and feel very very sick? Fantastic.

Wait? It's Thursday - I'm meant to be making the two hour journey back home today - I have to be back to go to Comic Con on Friday morning.

But this little guy needs a home. Being in a tank isn't good. He needs the ocean.

Anyways, me and Qui-Gon have a nice day. I work out a plan to get him to the sea. I'm too ill to make the 6 hour journey to Skegness. However, I can make an hour and a half journey to my hometown, and my friend has offered to drive me the other hour and a half to Southend the following evening.

I put him on the side, fill the box with ice, place the first teatowel over the ice, then put him back in the box with some food, then food and seaweed. Finally i put the second teatowel over the box to protect him from the sun. I've made up artificial saltwater to the correct concentrations to splash him with (not great, but should keep him hydrated).

Lots of train delays, tram delays, bus delays. Should be home at 8, I get back at 10.30. Me and Qui-Gon made a lot of friends - apparently you get attention when carrying a lobster on a 110 mile train journey. He's eaten some fish, seems happy. No signs of stress such as tail thrashing. 

I get him home and put the box back in the fridge. He seems a happy lobster. I check on him before bed. Happy lobster.

**Friday** 

I wake up at like 7. I check on Qui-Gon. He is responsive and seems okay, I splash him a little more. I head to London

Comic Con stuff - whilst filled with anxiety over his wellbeing.

I get back, my friend informs me that there is a fish center that can take him, about 30 miles away - and keep him in suitable conditions. I agree on the condition that he will be released in Cornwall (where he first came from).

Sadly, when I got home, he was unresponsive - after trying to get him to do stuff, gently brushing his eyes, unclipping his claws, etc. It's clear he is dead. I'm legitimately upset. A fully grown, 6ft, bearded man, may have cried over a lobster.

However, he did eat the salmon and cod, and displayed no signs that he had thrashed or tried to escape, or was other wise stressed. It seems that he died whilst numbed from the cold of the fridge, hopefully asleep.

I wrapped him in the seaweed so it would be like home, and went to the nearest lake, and eased him into the water. He didn't last long enough to get him proper help.

I literally spent Wednesday-Saturday with my life revolving around looking up information, caring for, seeking help for, and transporting, a lobster. I do not like animals, I do not want pets.

Qui-Gon was a special fella.

TLDR: Avid meat/fish eater. Emotionally bonded with a lobster in a fishmongers. Went on 120 mile (193km) journey in an attempt to return him to the sea. He died, now I am sad. However he had a nice couple of days eating fish and making friends.

AITA for buying my sons houses but not my stepdaughter?,"I'm 48M, girlfriend is 44F, her daughter is 21F, my sons are 23M and 25M but they're mostly irrelevant to this post. I've been dating girlfriend for six years.

Years ago I bought both of my sons homes. I told them both the same budget, go find a house you like and let me see it, and I'll buy it for you. It was college graduation gifts sort of. I promised the same to my stepdaughter: graduate college, get a home wherever you want with a $200,000 budget. I firmly believe you can't get far in life with the current apartment rental rates, so this takes a major load off of shoulders.

Well, she graduated this past April and my girlfriend is bugging me to get the ball into motion on getting her a house. The thing is that when I made that promise years ago, I assumed we'd be married by now. I want to get married, but she doesn't want to. I told her I don't feel comfortable buying a house for someone ""not officially in the family"" if that makes sense.

Now the promise is if we get married, she can have a house, but I did make a compromise I could buy her a house but it remains in my name. My fear is I buy a house for someone, my girlfriend and I don't work out and split, then I've basically bought a house for a stranger.

Am I being an asshole here? If it makes a difference, my girlfriend is a SAHM, stepdaughter lives with us. Stepdaughter works in a hospital right now but it's relatively far (city over, 40\~min drive). I'm retired but have large savings, so I'm the only one with the money to make it happen.",AmItheAsshole

Google keeps marking our business as ""permanently closed"". This has happened twice and it's been during our busiest season.

TIFU by putting my dick in a year old fleshlight,"I bought a fleshlight back in February of 2018, using it on and off again for about 3 months until I decided to box it up for good. I had had enough of the joy the toy brought me, and had just started a relationship with my now lovely girlfriend.

Flash forward to yesterday, when I was looking through my old junk. I was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when I came upon the box. I smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. I put it aside for today, when I decided to use it. Out of lube, I went it dry, fuck up #1. Once I reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, I felt a tickling sensation. Uneased I pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. To my surprise, and disgust, I was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. Without thinking, I instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. In pain, I freaked out and let the spider get away.

My dick now hurts, and a spider is now loose in my house.

"My (30M) wife (29F) just told me she doesn't love me anymore and wants to end our relationship, but still live together for financial reasons and for continuity for our 3 young kids. Is this a terrible idea?","I'm going to start by apologizing in advance if this doesnt stay fully focused.

My wife and I have been together for 10 years. Married for 5. We met in college and has been the love of my life since.

2 days ago she told me she doesnt love me anymore and for her happiness wants our relationship to end.

I probably should have seen this coming, our relationship has been rocky since we met but for whatever reason I always wanted to make it work. 

We have 3 kids together, all under the age of 6. They are amazing and so happy and the best thing from our marriage.

Financially, my wife is a stay at home mom. She owns our house outright from family money. She has no student loans but also no college degree. I make a fairly decent income and support our family. 

Since my wife doesnt have a job and no way to pay bills, she wants me to move into her finished basement and continue to pay utilities and food for us and our kids, in addition to keeping her on my health insurance. She wants to take time to get her degree and file for dissolution afterwards, so she can support herself and our kids.

She also wants this for continuity for our kids. While she doesnt love me anymore, she doesnt want me out of our kids lives even weekly, and still wants to be friends with me.

I'm honestly dying inside right now, because as rocky as our relationship has been I've never loved her less, and she has been all I've ever loved or wanted.

I dont know how to proceed or even feel at this point. Im terrified because I've let my friendships go since we've been married and while my family will support me i dont have many friends left. I'm terrified about finances. I'm terrified of not being able to be happy without her. Honestly i'm so confused about everything going on in my head.

On top of that, is it stupid to stay in the house for our kids? It would be convenient for me financially too as even though if I moved out we would share custody, I dont have to pay child support this way. It's also better for my taxes. 

I'm just so lost I dont know what to think. Sorry for the long winded ramble.",relationship_advice

AITA for telling people my sister's youthfulness comes from plastic surgery and fillers?,"My sister is 34 and I'm 40, but since our early 20s people have always assumed she's the older sister. 

I don't know why she seems to have aged early or why I look younger - I was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. I used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).

I moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. Last weekend I went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and I was shocked by her appearance.

I knew she used botox, but this was next level. Her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. I asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". I'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.

She asked me not to tell anyone and I said of course I wouldn't. But then...

Now, I thought she looked weird because I know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

I was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""It's probably because I didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

As a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, I was hurt by that. Without thinking I blurted out (louder than I'd intended): ""Oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

I regretted it before I'd even finished saying it, but I thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

My mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. My brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. Pretty much everyone else thinks I am a massive asshole.

Then I remembered the scene from that movie and decided to try it out myself. I went and got a towel, and then laid down on the counter, putting my head under the sink faucet. I put the towel over my face and turned the water on. You can only imagine what happened next. I suddenly realized what was happening in the movie. As soon as I turned the faucet on, I couldn't breathe. This scared he living shit out of me, and I tried to scream, which made it like 10x worse. I started thinking to myself that I was gonna die. With my amazing problem solving skills I tried to remove my head from under the faucet and hit my head on it really hard. I somehow managed to get the towel off of my head and I was freaking out whilst turning the water off. I just sat on the ground and cried my ass off for like an hour. And that's how I learned what waterboarding was. Also after about an hour I had a half circle kind of bruise on the top of my forehead from hitting the faucet.

LPT: Start thawing a large turkey today for Thanksgiving (USA),"Retired butcher here.  
Turkey thaws at a rate of 3-4 lbs a day (edit: thaw in the fridge, bottom shelf, on a cookie sheet), so a 21 lb bird needs to start thawing now to be ready for Thanksgiving. Note- drips from the turkey can contaminate food below.

Other turkey tips: 

* Don't stuff a bird for best results. Stuffing stops the air in the cavity from cooking the bird and makes it so the outside must be overcooked to get the inside to a safe temperature.  

* A safer alternative to stuffing that still enhances its flavor: butterfly the turkey and cook it on a bed of stuffing.  This will reduce cooking time, look at a few recipes to get a feel for how long it takes.

* If you have to thaw a turkey quickly, keeping it in cold running water for a few hours will work. However, this method take more work, can add another unknown time element if done the day of, wastes water, and I don't think the end results are a good as a slow thaw.  

* Avoid recipes that cook at 350°F or higher for the duration. I cook my 18-22lb bird at 250°F for about 3 hours, then go up 400°F for about an hour. (Edit: apparently Alton Brown's method starts high, then goes low, so there are other ways)

* Use a probe meat thermometer to tell if the turkey is done. White meat should be be 165°F (maximum, after resting, the bird will continue to cook, so pull it ~10°F earlier) ~~and dark meat 180°F.~~. Apparently 170-175 for dark meat is recommended by Cook's Illustrated.

* While there are minor differences between brands, almost all frozen turkeys are the same. I always get the cheaper store brands. The only real differences are between Kosher/organic/seasoned.
* (edit) Don't baste or open the door to peek- it's more important to maintain a constant temperature. With a higher temp near the end, the bird will brown very nicely. 

Swing by /r/meat or PM me if you have questiions. I hope all your birds come out well.

After I canceled my ClassPass membership, I noticed that I was being billed by Crunch Fitness for a membership, which was weird.  I contacted their customer support and it took several months until I could actually cancel that gym membership.  Since I didn't remember signing up for a gym membership, I asked for a refund, then I would referred to the original guy who registered me - who isn't even working there anymore.

I finally got one of the customer support reps to give me a copy of the original application -- turns out they fucking FORGED my signature.  Not sure how they even got my credit card information - I never actually paid for anything through them.  It is possible that they were able to obtain that information through Class Pass.  Note at this point, it has already been nine months since I started to get billed and they owe me over $500 - and I still haven't been able to get a refund from them.

Can I sue?  They can't just steal my credit card information and forge my signature.  What would be the best way to go about this?",legaladvice

TIFU By being the only man alive who doesn't use Vaseline as lube,"This didn't happen today but last night. I've been back home visiting my parents with my gf for the past week. Now me and my dad have always been really open about things in our life, including things like relationships. So yesterday night around 10pm things were winding down while myself and my gf decided it was about time to go to bed. Right as we head to bed my dad makes the joke ""Now remember my room is right above yours, I don't want to hear any funny business up there!"". He was clearly being sarcastic so we started joking back about how we were going to have crazy sex up there and he'd just have to listen to it.

We all laugh and then we head upstairs to get ready for bed. Now for the second piece of context, I have a skin condition that makes me REALLY itchy downstairs, pretty much everywhere from the groin over to the rectum. So I have a couple creams I use, but for the rectum in particular the skin is really sensitive so I was instructed to just used medicated Vaseline. I usually put in on every night before bed and it helps me from wanting to constantly scratch my asshole all the time.

So as usual I head to the bathroom, pull out my bathroom bag, and pull out a tub of vaseline. Our upstairs bathroom door has never fully locked/shut since the door was never aligned correctly so the door is always openable, but usually its not an issue. I get some Vaseline on my two fingers and start applying to the aforementioned area right as my Dad busts in the bathroom to tell me something. I still have no idea WHY he did this, but its more than likely he just wasn't thinking.

So there he sees his only son, lubing up his asshole from a tub on vaseline, naked as the day he was born. He starts saying ""What are you doin-"" and then you can see it click on his face. The tube of vaseline, me effectively lubing up my asshole, the jokes about having ridiculous sex, all of it. He immediately goes pale and gets super embarrassed, then runs out of the bathroom yelling ""O-oh, s-sorry!"". 

I was too embarrased to go talk to him right then so I just went to bed. This morning when I came downstairs I started to bring it up and he just looked away and said ""What you two do with your free time is no concern of mine"". I will probably never be able to convince my dad that I am infact not into pegging.

TL:DR I used Vaseline on my asshole for medical reasons and now my dad thinks I like having my girlfriend peg me

EDIT: For everyone asking, I have definitely seen a doctor about my condition. And for everyone in a similar situation who wants advice I highly recommend doing the same!",tifu
AITA for Introducing my GF as a Model?,"So I have been dating this Girl for awhile now. She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said ""Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.

\*\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.

I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Edit

At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.

&#x200B;

First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200B;

Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.

&#x200B;

After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200B;

What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).

&#x200B;

The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200B;

I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.

&#x200B;

I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200B;

First off its not as glamours as I thought it was

&#x200B;

She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200B;

She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a ""Model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200B;

She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200B;

This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200B;

Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.",AmItheAsshole

Found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens,"This has been going on for several years. I live in a small rural neighborhood with an HOA where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. As with most HOAs, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. There will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. It really annoys my husband. I just laugh at it

Well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. There were a lot of emails sent about this. A lot of drama. I don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

So then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. Some people thought it could be deer eating them. There were several theories. The next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. This year it started happening again and people flipped out. All caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. Two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

It started out being funny because I'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. But this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

So anyway, you already know what happens. I walk down to the bottom of our property that I don't visit often and I find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. Like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

I went inside and told my husband jokingly ""I think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" He got this really weird look on his face and I had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

He confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. He was sneaking out at night to do this. I asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

I don't even know. This makes me really uncomfortable. The man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and I didn't even notice? Why wouldn't he just tell me? Like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

I don't know what to do. Can anyone help me think this through. Maybe I'm overreacting but I'm pretty upset

My (36F) husband (40M) has been accused of harassment.,"
I've been told to update here. Thank you everyone for all you did today. Here's my update.

The children are asleep and he is upstairs after one of the weirdest days of my life. Everyone will be ok but things are different than they were when I woke up this morning and asked the internet for advice.

Here are how things are different.

First, everything was settled with the complaint. All he knows is that a settlement was reached with her lawyers. He keeps his job. I was mislead about when the complaint was filed and what the timeline was. It was much further along than he said when he first told me. I'm still not sure what the sequence of events was because he was very sketchy, but there were weeks where he knew before he told me at least. During the investigation some problem with an expense report came up that was unrelated to the matter. He's going to have to pay some money to the company. This will come out of his share of the marital assets. I don't know if he did or didn't with this woman, but she is definitely hurting and I can't stand that.

Today I prayed on it, and I decided to ask one of the nannies. I messaged her and asked how she was doing. She's fine and happy. I asked this. ""I apologize for the abruptness, but I want to make sure the people in my life are ok. I have to ask. Did anyone, my family or friends, in my house ever make you feel uncomfortable or did anything inappropriate toward you? Please know I love you and nothing will change that."" The little three dots popped up immediately but then disappeared. This happened many times over the next hour. She responded and it was long. She said she didn't tell me because she didn't want break up what she thought was a perfect family. I was away with the kids at my parents. She helped us get in the car and get going. He had to stay back to work. He asked her to help with some organization and cleaning that I wanted done. He fixed himself a drink and offered her one. I won't go into the details except to say I know she is telling the truth that he and she had sex that night. She described generally what happened. There is a thing my husband likes to do that she described about how he started to have sex with her. I recognize the move from being married to him for thirteen years. I told her I loved her and that if she needed anything from me she would get it. I can't imagine what she is going through right now.

I texted the other former nanny. Same situation. I was away with the kids on some vacation. He was staying back for work. She said he made a move toward her and she rebuffed. Told her I loved her and that if she ever needed anything I would do it. I haven't asked the current nanny, but I will.

I've emailed a friend of a friend who is a divorce attorney. I'm tired, and I've cried inside a lot tonight. I'm thinking about what the future brings, but I think everything will be ok.

I won't check the old post anymore. I will check this one as I can. If you have any prayer requests, I'd love those. Either for you or for someone you know is hurting. If you do pray, keep my family and all the women in yours. If you don't, please send us love. Always be kind. Thanks.

Original Post:
We have been married for 13 years and have seven kids. I'm a stay at home mom with the kids. He works for a company and is relatively high up in the org chart. 

He has always been a loving husband and great dad. Our marriage has had the normal ups and downs and life is hectic in the house but we have a good marriage I believe. He's there for me emotionally and physically even though his job demands a lot from him. He's always there for the big events for the kids when he can and is wonderful with them. 

He came home recently and dropped a bombshell. A woman in his company has said he forced her into an affair for a promotion. He doesn't directly supervise her but she's in his department. He told me she's lying. I cried for a long time and we talked. He gave me his phone and email and I didn't see any correspondence with her. She said he made her get hotel rooms to have sex. I don't see anything in the bank account for the last three months that suggest anything weird. He says she has hotel receipts but nothing that ties him to it. He says she is pissed cause her salary negotiation was bad and she's pissed at what she got when she was promoted. 

I'm scared for my family and our future. I just use Reddit to talk to other SAHMs and for mommy advice. Never thought I'd be posting here. 

I believe him. I haven't seen him ever lie to me and he'd have no reason to step out cause he knows I'm here for his needs. There's no problem in the marriage I can see. It doesn't make any sense why he would try to have an affair with this woman.  She's attractive but not the type he normally thinks is attractive. 

But there is a seed of doubt because she went to HR and I don't think you make up something like this without any evidence or just to lie.

How can I be sure? How can I know or have more evidence that nothing will come of this? Please help.",relationship_advice

Tricked into eating something I don't eat at work. Is this illegal/a toxic work environment?,"This is in Alabama. I'm really really upset over all of this so I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense. This happened last week and it was only brought to my attention today what exactly I ate and I'm a mess. My coworkers all cook a lot and bring in food for everyone.

One girl brought in a pie and was very proud of herself, saying I could eat it. So I did because I'm a trusting idiot. My stomach was a wreck that night and the next day but I'm pregnant and have a weird stomach anyways so I didn't connect the dots. There's been some other shit since and I'm on even stricter rules right now. One of my coworkers was commenting on it all today after seeing me eat my sad work dinner, and said outright that it isn't the end of the world if I eat the stuff I'm not supposed to because ""a lightning bolt won't come from heaven and kill you"". I sort of gave her a look and she laughed and said it didn't when I ate the pie and told me what was in it. I'm so so upset right now. I genuinely don't know what to do or say. They've ignored my wishes and been outright hostile before but never like this. I went home crying last week over something else and filed with HR over it but they didn't take it seriously and this is just my breaking point.

You've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
This is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. The reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of Disney fairytale. What a joke. But this is really ingrained in our culture. Think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

The fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. They take commitment. They take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

What does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*It means... not scrolling through the Facebook or IG pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. Saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if I was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*It means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""She/he was mean to me."" ""I deserve this."" ""She doesnt love me anyway. I can sleep with someone else now."" - Nope. you made a commitment. Stick by it and work on your issues.

\*It means... putting down the video games, the TV controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*It means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&#x200B;

These are just a few examples of things I see so often that kill marriages. The truth is that marriage between 2 people can be amazing and last a lifetime, but you have to work hard at it and ignore a lot of what our selfish, hyper-consumer culture tells us about how to behave.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by getting fired because of the movie Supertroopers,"Not today but back when I was waiting tables at a steakhouse years ago we used to do all kinds of dumb stuff to keep ourselves entertained. One thing we did was play the infamous ""cat game"" from the movie Supertroopers. Basically we would follow someone out to their table and when we placed the customer's food down we would say something like ""here's your strip steak meow"". Then, on a busy Saturday night, I followed a co-worker out and dropped of his customer's food followed by a ""here's your chop steak meow"". Apparently, the guy thought I called him ma'am, made a big scene, called over our freshly hired new GM who ended up comping a $80 check because of his bitching. I finished my shift and was fired before I left because he said he needed to make an example of me. In retrospect, I should have called the guy a chicken fucker.

Edit: yes I know I played the game wrong, hence the reason it backfired :)

TL;DR I got fired for playing cat game from Supertroopers",tifu

TIFU By Asking For Vagina In a Japanese Convenience Store,"For context, I'm on a vacation to Japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. To show a bit of gratitude, I wanted to cook for her so I decided to go for something simple like a Chicken katsu.

I've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. This is the moment I realized that I was out of breadcrumbs so I have to go to the convenience store to get some. I am somewhat decent in Japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? No.

As I walked in the store, I couldn't find the breadcrumbs I was looking for so I decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

Me: ""Sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

At this point I didn't realize that I mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". The staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking I was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. I repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. After the change of the staff's expression, I realized that I fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. I then explained that I mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

TL;DR I mistaken the word panko(breadcrumbs) for the word manko(pussy) asked a convenience store staff for pussy",tifu

AITA for cutting off contact with my son due to him refusing to accept his own responsibilities as a paren,"I am a father to 3 ""young adult"" (ages 18, 22 and 24) sons who live with me and who for the most part have always gotten along (normal brotherly fights but nothing serious). However throughout this summer I've noticed a bit of a tension between them. I told my youngest to spill the beans since I figured the conflict was between the older two since they seemed the most tense. My youngest tired to avoid eye contact and kept trying to play dumb but I kept pushing. My eldest child had some bad history of impulsive behavior when he was a few years younger (the worst being an incident which resulted in his expulsion from college) but he had been slowly improving his life and I didn't want to be too late to help him if he had done something to jeopardize itI really didn't want my youngest keeping secrets.

When I finally got the truth out I was in shock, it turns out that middle child gathered a baby (my granddaughter) over a year ago, but had refused to even see the child. My oldest found out since he happens to work with a cousin of the mother, and he has been trying to get his brother to take responsibility and be there for his child, but he has refused. 

I confronted my middle child and we got into a huge fight. He claimed that being a father would ruin his plans for life but I told him that he had to take responsibility for his own actions and that his child deserved to have a father in her life.

This went on for a while when I told him that if he didn't think his own child deserved a father then he didn't deserve a father himself and I told him that he had to leave the house. He is 22 years old and has a decent job and plenty of friends so I wasn't too worried about him. 

I have met my granddaughter and her family and have made some plans to sell my house and downsize to begin a college fund for her since my youngest child will go to college and my oldest has been saving up to move out. 

It has been about a month now and while I feel like I made the correct decision, I still feel terrible. I chose to end my relationship with my son, which hurts so much, since I have always felt closest with him throughout his life (he had the same interests that I had and was the most willing to spend time with me) I feel horrible that I raised a kid who was willing to not care about a human he helped create, I feel like i ruined any chance of a relationship between him and my youngest son, and I feel guilty since my wife has been crying a lot the last few weeks and I don't know how to fix anything.



AITA for this? Was my reaction too strong?


Edit: He is also incredibly lackluster at paying his child support, he has to be told to do it and even then he is reluctant.

Edit 2: a lot of people are getting upset about my reaction to the youngest child, however my oldest and youngest both have been trying to get him to own up on his own for months before I found out

[Update] I think my mom is going to try to kill my grandmother and make it look like suicide.,"I wanted to thank the r/legaladvice community and give an update to [my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9sudc9/i_think_my_mom_is_going_to_try_to_kill_my/) from about 4 months ago. For privacy purposes as this is an ongoing situation, this post will be fairly short and vague.

Last month my grandmother was admitted to the ICU in respiratory failure. She pulled through, but with the help of my aunts, uncles and cousins we determined (with evidence) that my mom has been both neglecting my grandmother's medical needs and drugging my grandmother without her knowledge. Although she wouldn't outright say it to me, it turns out that my mother had been insisting to my cousins that my grandmother was suicidal, and even tried to keep pushing the 'she wants to kill herself' narrative while my grandmother was hospitalized. We believe that she may have even attempted to OD my grandmother at the hospital, but her plan was thwarted by ever-present relatives. As an aside, we did alert the hospital of the situation and unfortunately were told they couldn't do anything because ""it's a family matter"". Everything is now in the hands of my aunt, who's working with a lawyer to address the situation in the least stressful way for my grandmother. Thank you all for your advice and support on my last post, and I'm so glad that my grandmother is still with us. I truly believed that this situation would only end in tragedy, but it seems fate had different plans. My grandmother is still in the care of my mother for the moment (with relatives checking in daily), and while my mother is not yet aware that my family knows of *everything* she's been doing, she does at least know that her siblings are seeking to change the POA and insurance benefits out of her name, and has since completely changed her tune about my grandmother's mental health. Otherwise, my grandmother is home and doing well, and is under the close eye of her children, doctors and social worker while my family works out where to go from here. Thank you all again.

UPDATE Mother in law suing for grandparents rights,"OP POST BELOW

&#x200B;

So we have court 4/10 which is actually best case scenario as our house is now sold and we close early May. We passed this by our realtor whom we had supporting documentation of us moving back when we talked to her in May of 2018 stating we were going to move south. She is so awesome she wrote a letter stating we were moving prior to all this happening and got it notarized by the state.

This should be a slam dunk and the judge will likely ask why are you wasting my time? Her reason for the requested visitation is ""she loves her grand kids very much and deserves to be apart of their life"" per the law she has no leg to stand on and this is not a valid reason she would be able to get visitation even if she does we are moving and i don't believe NY state can stop that. One last thing about this is the petition she filled out my sons birthday isn't even correct its off by 4 days.

Court date is 4/10 will update once court is completed.

"Tittyfucking is Fraud, Plain and Simple","Coffee and popcorn smell better than they taste. Fine cheese tastes better than it smells. 

With that in mind, I feel like tittyfucking has a spot on the coveted go-to sex moves list that is wholly unearned and flat out fraudulent. It simply looks better than it feels, in an unforgivable way. Tittyfucking is packaged and sold as a comparable experience, but it doesn't hold an erotic candle to a blowie or old fashioned HJ. 

The mechanics are faulty at best. Full disclosure, I prefer busty ladies. It's just who I am. Even so, being properly TF'd without embarrassing and perhaps painful slippage has been a unicorn.

TIFU by listening to Tenacious D around my 2yr old daughter.,"Yesterday afternoon, I was cleaning the house while my 2yr old was at her kiddy table coloring and I was in the living room with her, cleaning, and had my earbuds in while I was listening to my playlist (which includes all the Tenacious D albums). I should mention that I have a soundbar stereo system that also has Bluetooth connectivity.

If you're familiar with the works of Kage and Jables, you'll know of a song called, ""Double Team"". It was at the end of this song that my earbuds caught around the vacuum I was using and yanked them out of my phone, prompting the phone to connect to my sound system automatically. Over the speakers comes the ending of the track, which is Kage and Jables saying, ""Hail Satan!"" back and forth.

After reconnecting my earbuds, I looked at my daughter, still coloring, apparently oblivious to what just happened, and continued cleaning. About 10 minutes later, I'm in the kitchen to grab my daughter a snack, when my sweet, innocent, 2yr old baby girl in the room over starts saying, ""Hail Satan"" while continuing to scribble happily in her Frozen coloring book.

Being the poor father that I am, I began to laugh like a madman at the image of a 2yr old saying those words. That was a bad idea, because now, whenever my daughter wants to get a reaction out of me, she screams, ""HAIL SATAN!"" at the top of her lungs.

My wife is still pissed at me and doesn't want to take her to daycare next week...

-Your up beat spirit, always laughing, always joking.

-Your dimple smile.

-Your integrity, your honestness

-The way you provide tirelessly for your family

-Your handsomeness  

-Your big heart.

-The way you play with the boys and make them smile.

Things that are not working. (We have talked about everyone of these, to no avail.)

-Your selfishness with your down time. 
(Always doing what YOU need, video games, on your phone, running your personal errands, not recognizing that I need personal down time too) 

-The way you isolate (we have no friends, no social life, you don't even want to visit with my family)

-The way you expect me to isolate with you. (If I'm not with the kids, and doing something while you are working or having YOUR down time, you expect me to be there with you when YOU are ready.)

-Manipulating me to not leaving you alone with the kids (when I was at the gym or my AA meeting or an appointment, you would demand me back right away, guilt tripping me. when I would leave and rush home Caleb would be calm anyway.)

-Our intimacy issues. (We have never been on the same page, sadly I have begun to loose interest in you sexually) 

-The way you have exhausted the extravagant gift giving, (buying gifts doesn't replace the glue that is slipping away) 

-They way you act like you are better than everyone else because your now on a sober path, (you look down on people who drink or smoke pot, 75% of the population does, it doesn't make them a bad person, or an addict)

-The way that I'm 100% ignored; physically, emotionally, mentally, sexually, (you are always so lost in your phone or game you never hear me, you are not interested in me until I get upset.)

-The way you hold financial burden over my head. (Belittle me because you are the breadwinner, ""good luck having a life with no income"")

-The way you take ""jokes"" too far. (You know you are making me upset and you turn passive aggressiveness into a game and claim you are just joking, having fun.)

-The way we both are stubborn, butting heads, never backing down, trying to hurt each other with words. (We are unhealthy, the kids hear us fighting and it's untrue that they would be better off if we stick together. they need two happy, healthy parents, even if we're not under the same roof.)

Where do we go from here.

I want a separation. I want to share custody. I want to be healthy co-parents, we don't have to go through courts right away. I don't want half of your everything. I want to be amicable. I don't hate you in the least bit. I just cannot be happy married to you.",relationship_advice

AITA for telling my coworker about the reality of a 478 MCAT score,"The MCAT is basically the entrance exam for medical schools in the US. Applicants are graded from 472 to 528 based on a percentile. A 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. The median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. You must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.

Results for the June 15 exam came out yesterday. This coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. I myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the MCAT because I have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. I have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. Throughout this process, I have noticed that she didn't have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).

So when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, I took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. Threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the Kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).  I asked her to reconsider postponing her applications until next year. She had already sent out some primaries but haven't gotten any secondary applications back.

She was in near tears. It feels like I just crushed someone's dreams. She couldn't look me in the eye the rest of the day.

Open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

This has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

EDIT: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't MEAN that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. Either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

"Former grad student, considering suing my university for $14k unpaid wages (Texas)","Long story short, I completed my graduate degree back in December and my graduate advisor still owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages for the work I did in their research lab during my last year of grad school. This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me ""Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true"".

I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing. I informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. One of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. I gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. University legal still did nothing. I contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.

Granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but I spoke to them months before that. As far as I know, at this point my only option is to just sue the university directly. They have a massive legal department and they've argued in front of SCOTUS multiple times in the past few years, so I have no idea if or how I should approach this, but the simple fact of the matter is that this professor owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages, I have written statements promising me that amount, they slandered me in professional settings, and they're lying to the university and the federal government about how they're using research funds. What are the odds of suing a top-tier public research university with a multi-billion-dollar endowment and coming out ahead?  I'm in Texas if that's relevant.",legaladvice

my boyfriend and i were walking around scoping out the ranch and trying to see if we could find the host or anyone that worked there, petting the dogs, taking some photos/etc. then we saw this other dog walking around slowly. when we got closer we were horrified at his condition — i don't even know where to start. 

you could see every one of his bones. he looked like a lab/retriever/shepherd mix but his hair was so matted and dreaded i wasn't sure. he could barely barely walk. he was covered in flies and smelled like a corpse. his eyes were so infected they had sunken in and there were flies in his eyelids. his nose was super rotted/scabbed up and raw, and he was missing half his teeth. i'm pretty sure he was deaf because he only responded to us when we knelt down in front of him. he was covered in sores and open wounds. he was wearing a heavy studded leather collar with no tag, and there was an open wound under the collar from how much it had rubbed into his skin. the pus/blood from the wound had rusted the buckle on the collar so we couldn't even get it off.

when we found the dog we desperately tried to find someone at the ranch but for some reason no one was there (it was like 5/6pm). we had no cell service so we couldn't get in touch w our airbnb host and the wifi code they gave us didn't work. we were positive the dog wasn't theirs anyway, because there were several other dogs on the property who looked very fat and happy and healthy. 

we got the dog some water and fed him some soft bread. he was ravenous and practically inhaled that water and two more bowls we filled for him. then he collapsed at my feet and legitimately thought he was going to die. we decided to take him to a vet or a shelter  but because we were in the wilderness, the nearest one was an hour away. 

i wrapped him up in a blanket and held him in the backseat while my boyfriend sped to the vet. the car was full of flies. we cranked the AC and he slept the whole way there. we carried him into the vet and they took him back. while i was filling out paperwork, the vet tech came out and told us that his wounds were full of maggots that had gotten so deep into his body it wasn't possible to save him so they'd have to put him down. 

i knew he was in bad shape but i guess part of me was sure he could be saved. i was fucking heartbroken, and i know he's not in pain anymore but i was so so sad he was stuck out in the desert without anyone to love him for so long. we named him stevie. 

ANYWAY! we got back to our airbnb, the next morning got breakfast and met the host etc etc. we were chatting and i decided to tell her about the dog in case the owner ever came around looking for him (doubtful). it turns out that the dog belonged to the fucking ranch!! the lady was saying all this insane shit about how the dog just pretends to be really droopy and sad so you'll give him attention, and he's just old. she said they'd been thinking about putting him down for the last SIX weeks but they wanted to ""let nature take its course."" i was losing my shit but just kept my cool cus i didn't wanna piss her off considering the delicate situation of me uh, putting her dog down. she seemed very nonplussed about it, but she did say that she's glad we told her because if the dog had gone missing, ""we would have frantically looked all over for the little guy."" ???? how do you care about a dog and also let it become malnourished and infested with maggots and flies? 

and THEN she asked if we were able to recover the collar from the vet (!???&$) and i said no because the collar was rotted into his flesh...

we left the airbnb a little later and then she messaged me via airbnb and asked me for the info and name of the vet we took him to. i gave her the info and called the vet just to give them a heads up that the owners might come asking for the dog. 

so to get to my question — i'm concerned this woman might try to go after me for getting her dog put down (despite the fact that she said they were planning on doing it themselves and that they wanted ""nature to take its course""). is this even remotely a possibility or am i just being paranoid? i should have maybe tried harder to get a hold of the host once we got into cell service, but all i had on my mind was getting the dog some medication attention asap. thanks in advance for your help. 

(also RIP stevie, hope you're painlessly frolicking in pup heaven and someone's brushing your hair and giving you tummy rubs and snackies. you were a good boy.) 

**tldr:** found what we thought was an abandoned dog in near-dead condition on a ranch. took it to the vet, had to be euthanized. turns out he belonged to the ranch owners who said they were just letting ""nature take its course"" and now they're asking me for the vet's info. should i be worried/do they have any grounds to sue me or press charges for my killing their dog??

**UPDATE:** I've reached out to Airbnb and let them know what happened so that I can post an honest review without any repercussions (although based on some comments here, it seems as if Airbnb is not favorable to the customer and usually sides with the host). I've also reached out to the clinic and got copies of 1) the Good Samaritan form I filled out upon arrival detailing his condition, the place I found him (the ranch), and his lack of identifying tags; and 2) the medical report from the vet detailing the large number of maggots and the need to euthanize him, as well as the fact that he wasn't chipped and was classified as a stray. When I spoke to the receptionist on the phone this morning, she recommended I report the issue to animal control, so I'm going to do that shortly. Still waiting to hear from Airbnb, which is concerning.

"TIFU by pissing my pants, puking on myself, almost killing/losing a $1800 snake, and confessing my undying love to 20 different women on a facebook status (I tagged my girlfriend as well).","Happened last night, a good friend of mine drove us to a downtown octoberfest around 5pm, I had about six beers by 7pm and I was definitely feeling drunk. He only had two beers and offered to drive to a liquor bar we frequent, I completely forgot about the age old ""beer before liquor never sicker"" and we went. I remember drinking 2 rum runners at one bar and then leaving to go to another and this is pretty much where I blacked out. I woke up this morning in my bed, still dressed in my button down and slacks, covered in pee and vomit. I took a shower and checked my phone, I had sent a bunch of extremely embarrassing messages to random friends and old girlfriends. I checked my facebook and saw I posted a status confessing my love for 20 different women, and I tagged them. I also confessed that I loved my ex more than I could ever love my current girlfriend and tagged them both. I had a ton of missed calls and a voicemail from my girlfriend telling me she didn't want to see me again. I ate breakfast and sat down contemplating my life when I noticed I did not see me extremely expensive female black eyed leucistic ball python in her cage. I was not sure my stomach could sink any farther but it did, I freaked out. I looked all over my room before finding my python wrapped up in my piss covered bed sheets. My guess is I took her out of her cage before falling asleep.

TLDR: Drank 6 beers before drinking 4-5 cocktails, woke up in a pool of my own piss and vomit, messaged a bunch of random women and posted on facebook that I loved them, girlfriend broke up with me, almost killed/lost an extremely expensive ball python. ",tifu

TIFU by accepting a Fed-Ex package in a towel,"Do I get bonus points? This happened less than an hour ago and I'm still laughing. 

I had been expecting a delivery all day, but I had to get ready for work. ""I'll grab a fast shower, what can go wrong?"" Ha. Hahaha. I was shaving my legs when I heard the doorbell ring repeatedly, and my 120-lb German Shepherd going ballistic. I knew this was a delivery I would have to sign for, so I leapt out of the shower, fumbled for my glasses, and threw on a towel. I didn't notice that I was still dripping soap at this point. (This is important later on).

I THOUGHT I locked my dog in my room as I ran to the door, but I guess the door didn't shut all the way (also important). So I opened the front door, hiding behind it to maintain some decency as I scribble and drip on the pad the poor driver offered me. Then I hear it- the dreaded sound of paws racing across hard wood. My moron dog slips in a puddle of soap, looses his footing, and crashes into the door, sending me, towel, and scribble pad flying. I landed on my ass, naked as the day I was born and sopping wet, sitting on the very same scribble pad. The poor driver got a very X-rated look at my tattooed hide as I scrambled for my missing towel (somehow it landed halfway across the room), one hand across my tits and the other trying to cover my half-shaved lady garden. I stammered an apology as he grabbed his scribble pad and practically RUNS to his truck, so red his ears might be smoking. 

My furry asshole of a dog is now watching me type this and I swear the bastard is laughing at me. Fuck my life.

Lyft charged me $100 for throwing up in my drivers car on the way to the bar on NYE. I was sober at the time with my girl friend and neither of us threw up. What should I do?,"North Carolina: Lyft has pictures of his stained car with food strewn about. Looks like possible throw up, but in now way was caused by us. Also some of the throw up was on the seat we were sitting directly on...

His car was already a mess when he arrived. We would be late to the ball drop if we had chosen another ride. We were in the car for 6 minutes and had a nice conversation. 24 hours later I was charged $100. What can or should I do?

Update: Lyft has informed me that the evidence the driver gave was enough to close the claim indefinitely. Also, the last email that they sent me said that my driver ""Roy"" (not my driver) filed the claim promptly.... Who the fuck is Roy and where is my fucking money! 

Looking in to get the info behind the photos. Still no reply from Lyft. Used my debit card and the bank said they may be able to challenge the charge.

Will update soon with photos .",legaladvice
AITA for telling my mom I think it's disgusting she is having another kid,"I feel like I was in the right but my aunt, three of my siblings think I'm an asshole. I'm 31 and a female and I'm the oldest of ten kids my parents had me at 15,16 respectively. They both dropped out of high school and they got married when my mom was 17. My dad joined the military and they had my next sibling on my moms 18th birthday. My brother is 28, the other kids range in age from 10-27. I grew up taking care of my siblings, my mom and dad expected me to basically help raise their younger kids. Because of this I have no interest in having kids myself. My 23 year old sister pretty much took over my role and still lives at home. 

My mom is 46 she homeschools the 10,12,14, and 17 year olds. She has never worked although she doesn't do chores or clean the kids chores cover that. Her and my dad bought a fixer upper he planned on fixing up when he retires in a few years, they plan on turning into an organic farm.

However now that's all up in the air as my mom just announced this weekend she is pregnant again. She thought she was suffering from pre menopause..nope she's pregnant. Thing is she also admitted she had not been taking her BC for the last year and had hoped to have one more child. 

I lost my cool because my dad has a bad back and he should have retired this year. Now with the new baby he is saying he may have to work another ten years. I told my mom she's disgusting for doing that, and she had ten kids that's plenty enough 


She burst into tears and ran out of the room, my dad told me to leave unless I was going to apologize and my 20 year old brother and 23,25 year old sisters told me I was an asshole. 

My 28 year old brother and my gf said I maybe could have said it nicer but they think it's messed up.

"UPDATE: Un-permitted contractor next door did $5,000+ of damage to my home, contractor and homeowner won't pay or provide insurance information","Hi r/legaladvice. Just wanted to provide a ""thank you"" for all of the responses and an update on the situation detailed in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atin99/unpermitted_contractor_next_door_did_5000_of/). Basically, I'm a homeowner in Philadelphia, PA, and a contractor working on my neighbor's house caused a leak that led to a lot of mold and water damage that needs to be repaired, and the contractor and homeowner have ghosted.

&#x200B;

Since so many people suggested we file a claim with our homeowner's insurance, I gave that a shot. However, according to the adjuster I spoke to about our claim, our policy apparently has an exclusion for ""faulty workmanship"". Even though it's completely insane, I was told that our insurance company would not cover the damage or provide any legal assistance because the damage was caused by someone doing work on the house next door. The adjuster told me this is a very common clause in insurance policies. Basically, all insurance companies are completely manned by psychopaths and capitalism is an endless nightmare that will surely swallow us all.

&#x200B;

So now it looks like I'm back to square one. The police have suggested that I try to find information about the contractor and homeowner through the Licensing and Inspection Department to pursue legal action, but previous attempts at that came up with basically zilch aside from a suggestion to hire a lawyer. So I guess I'll try and find a lawyer that will take this case, although my previous attempts to reach out to lawyers about this issue have not been promising at all.

&#x200B;

Going forward, are there any additional avenues I should pursue? My insurance company (Farmer's by the way. If you're thinking of going with them I might suggest drinking poison instead) is completely worthless. The two lawyers I've spoken to seem to have absolutely no interest in taking up a case, one of them specifically advised against hiring a lawyer because of the relatively low cost of the damage, the amount we'd owe in legal fees, and the fact that cases like this are rarely paid out even when they're successful.

&#x200B;

It's been a bleak couple of days, but thank you all for your responses earlier and wish me luck.

Edit: ...Uh, whoa. I'll be responding to pertinent comments as I'm able, but being a dude with a 9 month old, it might be pretty slow going. Thank you all so much for taking the time to respond, and a big thanks to the mods for removing the lock on this post!",legaladvice

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

[Update] My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) are going on a week-long vacation. They uninvited me.,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/copzwa/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend_29f_are/)

Update, as promised.

I was really upset the day I dropped him off and he was texting me but I wasn't responding. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I didn't want to do anything at all in the state I was in. I waited until the next day, and then I sent him a thought out text letting him know that I didn't feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that I would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. He called but didn't leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn't understand.

The rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but I couldn't bring myself to pick up or text back. On Thursday, I think that he realized that I was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things — I told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

When he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. I was working all day, but also I still didn't want to respond. He asked me to explain because he didn't understand what was going on. The next day, I sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn't understand why I was throwing away everything that we built. He left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why I was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that I had made up about him to his face.

I wasn't going to respond to him and I wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. So I sat down to write him this letter. It's long, so skip over if you want. I tried to call him but I started crying and told him I'd just send him an email instead. This is what it said.

""The time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. I have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and I see that we should not be together. I am sorry that I have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn't have to change at my or anyone's behest.

From the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who I had never met that either she goes or I go on this trip, and you picked her. You didn't offer to have her meet me (theoretically I was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn't encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn't consult me at all. That's enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. However, I stayed.

This is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. Here is what I understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. Nothing happened. The other thing I understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. According to what I also understand, it took a long time for 29F's boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after I'm not sure how long. This is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that I was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). You did not tell me this was happening until I asked when the trip to Hawaii would be.

You purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which I have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which I repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. There is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. This makes me feel sick to my stomach.

So, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, I tell you that I want to meet this person. On my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend — a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. The first conversation that we have is one in which 29F and her boyfriend argue about how she dm'ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. You tell me about conversations that 29F has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship — stuff about kids and dogs. I have a discussion in which I let you know that I see that and that it worries me. 

Meanwhile, I am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. I, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. I want it to work out. But each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. Your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. It is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29M, we had only been together for nine months. How long did it take before 29F's boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? Much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

We go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our AirBnb for Copenhagen, we go over it when I tell you that I still feel uncomfortable and I do not feel good about the trip. Talk about repeatedly saying something! Although I ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. Surprisingly, I have no ideas either. 

Ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29F will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. You attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. This is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. This upsets me. You do not know what to do. I don't blame you — at this point, it was well out of hand. I don't know what to do either. There is no good solution that I can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. I tell you that either I have to get over it, or I have to break up with you, and that I don't want to break up with you. But my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down. 

She arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. After all of this lead-up, I know that you can tell how unhappy I am. I fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy I am. You leave, and when I don't respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope I'm okay and you're going to bed. No call.

The rest of the week was rough. My text to you was met with, essentially, ""I'm sorry you feel this way."" You tell me that I'm being unfair.

There is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. This is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. This is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29F, I guess.

In the end, all of this is to say that I have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

There have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what I can only assume are personal differences.

I cannot handle your relationship with 29F. And I suppose I could ask you to pick between her and me, but that's not what I want to do. I want you to have your best friend, and I want to leave. I did love you, but I am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that I'm crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

It seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. I am not happy in this, and I do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

There is no need for this to be mutual. I do not need your permission to break up with you.""

He wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that I would not be able to handle their relationship.

He said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

I wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

He agreed and apologized. For me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn't work for me and I don't feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. I stand by my decision at this point.

TLDR: We broke up.",relationship_advice

Am I in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?,"Context. Happened a few days ago. Me and my boyfriend were staying in a hotel with his friend and his wife (we've been together 3 years). We were all drinking and after awhile his friend and wife left. Me and my boyfriend had drunk sex and then went to bed.

After awhile his friend came back alone. My boyfriend got up which woke me up. I was half asleep, and heard the friend say something about my body. My boyfriend asked if he wanted to see. I was on my side away from them and heard them walking over. I panicked and didn't know what to do. Was I suppose to jump up and let them know I was listening? Freak out? (I have sever anxiety so this caused an attack). I froze and he lifted up the covers I was under. Edit: I was naked 

I confronted him the next day but he says I wanted him to see me because I didn't stop him and he should be upset at me but is understanding and I should be too so we can let it go.

Am I an asshole? Can I not be upset because I didn't stop it?

Update: thanks everyone so much for support/ advice. I've been with this guy forever and we were talking about starting to do foster care and marriage. I thought I was crazy and this wasn't as big a deal as I was making it since I wasn't touched or anything. I'd like to make an update after I talk with him again. When you make one do you just add it in here or make a new post? Im new to this.

To everyone saying it's ultimately my fault for not doing anything, mental illness is paralyzing. I was sexual abused as a kid and this was the same way my body made me (or wouldn't let me) react. I wasn't sure at first but I know I didn't do anything wrong. 

I'm sorry if it seemed like an obvious answer. It's hard to accept these things when it's someone you had a future with.

MORE INFO: I am hesitant to tell the friends wife because they have a baby together. I know she should know the kind of man he is but it makes me think of how I went through divorce but then again would he be a good father to the baby girl anyway?

TIFU by throwing out 18 pounds of meat in the Texas sun.,"Hello!

Last Wednesday I cleared out the freezer. My shitty ex-roommates had left 18 pounds of cheap meat in there, and I was so preoccupied by my thoughts of ""who the fuck even does that"" that it wasn't until after it was all in the bottom of the can that it occurred to me that the trash had just come the day before. 

Hm. Well, the lid will be closed. It'll be fine. Right?

On Friday, I exited the house and was greeted by several dozen flies. Ah. I've fucked up. This is immediately apparent to me. Well, it'll just have to wait until trash day.

Saturday. I need to take the kitchen trash out. I leave it outside, figuring that I can just wait until after the can has been cleared. 

Sunday. Raccoons have been in my bagged garbage. I need to take care of that. Hesitantly, I open the can lid. Oooooooh boy. In a split second, I get the immediate impression that there are hundreds of maggots in the can. I'm short—just barely 5'3"", So this was based entirely on the ones I could see far up the sides of the can. But I'm fairly tough, I think. I've pulled maggots out of a baby skunk's leg wound before. And I'm  a budding baby biologist. I can handle this. So I throw the bag into the can.

I am now sure there are at least 1000 maggots in the can. 

Monday. Otherwise known as today. I gear up. Poison, rubber gloves, eye protecting glasses, a face mask, and a box of moth balls. I can do this. I'm a scientist. I throw open the lid. It had not occurred to me that they might be on the underside of the lid.

There were at LEAST a thousand maggots JUST on the underside of the lid. These rained down everywhere, their hideous bodies plopping onto the ground. I thank my lucky stars none got on me. I screamed like I was being murdered, an entirely involuntary sound wrenched from somewhere deep in my spine. I sprayed. And I sprayed, and I sprayed. I walked around and sprayed the writhing layer of maggots on the underside of the lid. I sprayed at the ground. A fly flew at my face and I gave up, running back inside, sobbing. 

For a while, I watched from my back window as they crawled around on the can and the ground. I called my mom, who laughed at me. I called my dad, who was seven hours away and couldn't help. I called my boyfriend, who was five hours away and without a car. I'm here for school; I have friends, but none good enough to help me with something like this.

And it's Labor Day. I called eight different pest control places until I found one that was both open and able to send someone out. I'm currently awaiting my savior, who should be here in a few hours. I'll update with the cost of him coming out. 

TL;DR: grew maggots in 100° weather for a week, made it rain when I tried to take care of it. Now scarred for life. 

On the bright side, I now know for a fact that as much as I enjoy learning about bees and ants, I should not apply to that entomology master's degree program I was looking at. 

Edit: the bug man came, he was super sweet, really excellent. If anyone in the Round Rock/Austin area needs pest control services, PM me, I'd be very happy to pass his info on. He didn't charge me, said I reminded him of his daughter, so I gave him the money I had set aside for a tip. 

Also: I threw out the meat because I didn't know if it was safe or not. I have no idea when it was frozen, most of it was unlabeled, and I have no way of knowing how long they waited between buying the meat and freezing it. If you want to be mad at someone, be mad at my ex roommates for buying and failing to eat 18 pounds of meat before moving across the country.",tifu

WIBTA if I still give my stepson the birthday gift I bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift my upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first?,"My husband Joe and I have been married for a few years. He has a teenage son, Jack, with his ex-wife Kim. Joe and I have a great relationship with Jack, who lives with us half of the time, and we are civil with Kim. 

For a couple of years now, Jack has been into a sport that I am also into, and last year he decided to train in that sport seriously. He has been doing very well so as a reward and to encourage him further I decided that for his birthday this month, I would buy him an important 'equipment' used in our sport. He has always wanted to own one himself and if things go well it will be with him for the next ten years so I know he will be very happy with it. 

Yesterday Kim called me and told me what gift she will be getting Jack (we do this now to avoid getting him the same gift, which has happened before). I told her that I got Jack the equipment for our sport. She was quiet for a while and then asked me if I could get another gift for Jack's birthday and just give him the equipment in October.

Kim said that she knows Jack will absolutely love my gift, so if he gets my gift and her gift at the same time, her gift will be upstaged by mine and all of Jack's attention will be on my gift. She said she has been saving for Jack's gift for a while so she would like to see him be happy and thrilled about her gift, and that is not likely to happen if Jack receives our gifts at the same time. 

I understand where Kim is coming from, but to me it doesn't seem right to treat giving gifts to Jack as a competition for his attention or affections that we have to resort to 'taking turns'. Why can't we both give him our gifts and make him as happy as he could be on his birthday, a day that it supposed to be about him and not about us?",AmItheAsshole

See, since I'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""Accounts"" folder and terminating the ones I don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn't get it by registering at the service directly. I'll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal. But little did I know.

Later in the day I get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some Imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. In addition to that I still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. Being the total jackass of an idiot that I am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, I decide to google the #1 top Reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on Imgur (yeah, the one about the Senate, with a total of whole damn 310K updoots). I open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise Satan himself. Of course Imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? It can't be this bugged, right? (I hadn't clicked one by then YET). So I click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this TIFU.

"[Update] ""My work's fun committee ignored reasonable request, HR told me to pound sand.""","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8826mu/ny_my_works_fun_committee_ignored_reasonable/

(New York)

A lot has happened over the last ten days.

I realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  I cannot live like this anymore.  And I mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

I was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that I was completely prepared to just stop living because I was too scared to find help.  So I went and found help.  

I took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, I found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  I've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

When I finally went back to work, I took the head of the Fun Committee aside and talked to her.  I explained to her that I have PTSD and some very severe anxiety issues and I apologized for not being more clear to her when I asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

And she cried.  She wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought I was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

Then, I spoke to my Manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where I can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  It is literally all I have ever wanted.

So, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  Apparently.

Thank you.",legaladvice
AITA if I back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? Best man is my ex fiancé who cheated on me and I can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.,"Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fiancé for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

I confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

And on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

I've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

Woukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?

Edit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I'm so sorry I haven't been reading I'll try and catch up

Edit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""Panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


Edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiancé not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiancé to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up.",AmItheAsshole

About a month ago I posted about my preggers roommate who knows I'm not a kid person. I came here to see if I was the jerk for not wanting to deal with it. This post garnered more attention than I expected but I wanted to thank you all for sharing your thoughts. It was truly divided between people who thought I was the jerk and people who thought I was in the right. I gave me a lot to think about.

After sitting on it for a few days, I contacted a local lawyer in my area and got a free hour of advice. She told me to go over my lease contract again and check all the fine print. It was good that she did because I found a clause that states I have to have all tenants on my lease even if they are temporary. I broke that rule by not putting my roommate on the lease. I had a meeting with my landlord and admitted my mistake. He said I didn't really break any laws by not having my roommate on the lease but Betty needed to come in and prove her income can sustain her and another person (her unborn baby) before they can add her. No big, right?

The result? Betty now knows she can't afford a baby. She has to apply for welfare if she wants to keep it so she moved back home (to another state) with her parents.

TL;DR - Betty moved out and back home with her mom. I AM the asshole for pushing it as far as I did. But I found a new roommate (19F) who is on the lease and who has no desire for kids for another five years at least. Betty is clearly better off with a support system at home and even emailed me a tiny picture of some white blurry thing with a big head that she called her son. It was gross.

Edit: Look -  I'm not a baby hater I just like them better out of the womb. Example - I like sex but I don't like unsolicited dick pics. Those are gross. That doesn't make me a man-hater either.",relationship_advice
AITA for saying I wont pay for my daughters education if she switches her major?,"As I said in my title, last night I sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major I will cease her tuition payments.

My daughter is currently a freshman in college. She has just started her first semester and I'm the one paying the bill. I have been saving for over 10 years to do this and I am happy to do it, as long as I feel she is actually setting herself up for success. During high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. She took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. I supported her through all this because I thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

This last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. My daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. I was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. She is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. Now I know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but I was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. When I tried to get why she was switching all I got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in LA. Apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

I tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""How do you plan to get a job"", etc. And she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. This angered me. I'm the one paying for this I feel I have a right to know and not be blown off like that. I thought over it all day and so last night I sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. I am the one paying for her education and I won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. I told her if she doesn't want to do CS that's fine. But she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys AND can get her a career. And if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. She can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

This did not sit well with her. We fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. My ex called me up after and told me that I'm no better than a dictator right now and that I'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what I want.

&#x200B;

All I want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. AITA here?

Edit:

Wow, did not expect this.

I have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. Before I say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because I see the same question sent to me and I don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

I do not have a problem with my daughter getting a LA degree.

If my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, I would support her 100%. I don't care what my daughter does with her life. I just want her to do something with her life. I am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. The least I feel I can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. I get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. And many of you have told me that I should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. For those two last points, I feel you are wrong.

This money that I have saved is not a ""gift"". This is what I have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. This is my investment in her. For people who claim that I should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, I respectfully disagree. Giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing I could do for her right now. Supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. And the fact that she seems to think that I am owed no explanation and that I should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment I am making in her.

I am not arguing whether or not I am wrong. If you all feel I am an asshole for this, then I will accept that.

&#x200B;

I called my daughter and left a message saying that I wish to talk with her about this and that I feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. If my daughter wants to go into LA, then that is her choice. Weather or not I pay for it will be mine.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for turning off the dryer on someone who removed my laundry before it was done?,"I live in an apartment complex that has a common wash room for clothing... laundromat style. Today I did a load of laundry, and all was normal until I went to go get my stuff out of the dryer. Someone had taken the liberty of unloading the dryer and setting my clothing on a random washing machine. My clothes were dry, yes, but I had set a timer for about 4 minutes before the dryer ended so I could free it up ASAP. I walked into the wash room knowing I had time left on the dryer, expecting to see my clothes still drying. Upon noticing the disparity I became pretty mad.... so what did I do? I noticed the other residents clothing still had 37 minutes left, they probably bought 40 minutes. I decided to open the dryer door, stopping the drying cycle, close it, and not start it. The question is, am I the asshole for ensuring my fellow resident a soggy pair of underwear after they stole dryer time from me, AND took the liberty of throwing my personal laundry around without my knowledge.

TIFU by sending my crush eleven drunk texts.,"I awoke this morning with a killer headache, only to discover I had spam texted my crush last night. My completely wasted brain probably thought it was the greatest idea ever to text him, and now my mostly sober brain wants to move to Cuba.

Such wonderful messages included: 

- ""Jar jar Binks was a fucking mistake"" (After drunkenly purchasing the Prequel Saga DVD set on Amazon).

- ""I've had several beers and a whole box of lucky charms. . .that means I am three percent made of lucky charms now""

- ""Also I figured it out finally. Why you're such a cute, You look like jospeh Gordon levity and he was great in the movies""

- ""Get ready for some math""

- ""You're a smart guy you will undertaken""

- ""I don't think I ever been so drunk than right now what is more than several because that is how many""

Honestly, I'm hoping we can laugh this off. If you see this, man, I'm sorry! 

TL;DR: I drunk-texted my crush several times and sounded like the biggest idiot ever.

Edit: For anyone asking if he responded, yes, he did! He agreed that Jar Jar Binks was a total mistake, and suggested hangover cures. And I admitted he was really cute and that [I threw up the Lucky Charms](https://imgur.com/a/mo3A7jo).

Edit #2: Yes, I am female (not that it should really matter). By ""Man of Culture"" he meant the meme.

Edit #3: Holy moly, thank you guys all so much for your kind words! (: Here's the original texts in all of their [not-so-glory.](https://imgur.com/a/APDAjj4) He found the post, and everything's cool.

AITA for not wanting my in-laws to visit our new baby?,"Just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. I feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. 

I just had a baby on July 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. I know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like I have to entertain also. It would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that I expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). She also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores I could get in while he's asleep don't get done. 

She texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. This is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and I'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. I wrote her back and told her that I'm really not up for visitors this week because I'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. She hasn't talked to me since yesterday after I wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. AITA here?",AmItheAsshole
Should I (23F) tell my boyfriend (26M) about the egg?,"Pretty short and sweet. Together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. He admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. This guy's pretty good! Up until then I hadn't seen any. But I just spotted the giant one. I really didn't mean to, I haven't been trying to look for them. 

Should I tell him so he can re-hide it? Or do I take it tomorrow?

Edit: I forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because I was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

Edit update: he came to the room and I said ""What if I told you I found the giant egg?"". He laughed and told me ""Well, I got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" I jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help I will."" 

I am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! Will update then :)

Mini update: doing my morning routine. SO left for church with his family while I get ready to go and clean a gentleman's house and answer some of the Reddit comments! One of the eggs was in my coffee pot. I guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! I'm so touched, honestly. It kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! Will be back later once we're both home and I can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

UPDATE: firstly, a couple people I think asked so [here are the eggs in question](http://imgur.com/a/Lw1xoy3). The Reese's thing is more of a basket, but I won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. On the shelf I could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's Reese's for me in the ""egg"" xD. If you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; I took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) And ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. As for the last one, both of us swear I found it, but I must have dropped it somewhere? Under the couch or something. Idk. In the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

For everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. BUT, I mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way I've got it planned MUCH better."". Which isn't much news to me, as I've said we've discussed marriage at length (I even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). All I've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to DO IT.  I mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so I'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. Searching for the eggs was very fun!! I needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg I needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand I was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

And no, I don't think I missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. I think I really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

Now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! I'll put slips of paper in each egg I hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things I love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) So, that's all folks. No proposal, but a very happy Easter on both ends! Thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. Keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. And to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; I've been there too. If you go through my posting history you'll actually find that SO and I went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. It took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

TLDR; boyfriend hid eggs. I found eggs. Reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini Reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

Edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their SO, Easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",relationship_advice

Update to caught my (27M) girlfriend (24F) masturbating and she started crying,"Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bt4yar/caught_my_girlfriend_24f_masturbating_and_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Damn I got a ton of great advice on my post, thanks guys. Reading your comments made me realize that I'm probably a dumbass and should have thought about it more. She didn't have any trauma but her family was pretty religious and conservative growing up which I relate to, my parents were the same way and they never talked about sex or anything. But it was different in my house, they knew or assumed I would jerk off, they said little things sometimes and acted like it was completely normal. I got her before she fell asleep and asked her about it. She told me that they never mentioned masturbation or sex (we had our own ... interesting problems with that too) as if it didn't even exist but she knew it was bad and she couldn't ask about it or anything. 

It was good, we had a long talk about it like a discussion, we were just talking. No judgment, it was nice, I missed her. Basically she had only started doing it when she was 19 and she liked it but always felt guilty afterwards because she felt disgusting. She tried to stop and it was hard and she saw it as a big personal struggle but she eventually ""quit"" around probably a year later and hadn't done it for a long time. So when we met, she was masturbation free and wasn't lying all this time when she said she didn't do it. 

And then when she walked in on me, she started thinking about it and just started doing it again sometimes because it was fun and she still felt guilty so when I saw her, she felt embarrassed. She admitted that her teasing me and mentioning for weeks was her projecting and trying to make herself feel better in some way. I told her it was completely fine and normal and her private business to do what she wants, no fap or pro fap. Obviously I didn't change her deep rooted views so quickly. I tried telling her that I knew she felt gross but my view of her didn't change at all and I still love her the same and she liked that and gave me a hug. So that's that. She didn't cry again but she did talk to me with her head under the comforter. I know a couple comments told me not to do this but my brain screwed up and I said that it was so hot and I wanna watch her. She felt embarrassed and told me not to hold my breath but maybe one day. We're good now. Had breakfast together and she was fine and back to normal. 

Thanks for all the help. I knew I wanted to bring it up but all the pointers and lines really helped. We talked for a while and opened up an interesting discussion, it was good. 

Some people mentioned that she may have been thinking about someone else, had someone hidden under the covers or our sex isn't good. That's definitely not it lol. And just wanted to say that the comments calling her a hypocritical bitch are really fucking weird. I did not make that post thinking ""wow my BITCH girlfriend has double standards, I should have continued to tease her, it's what she deserved, she made jokes on me for WEEKS, how fucking dare she, I'm gonna get revenge"". I love her, she's my girlfriend, not my enemy. I can take a couple harmless jokes about choking the chicken, it's not that serious. Some of you guys have a concerning lack of empathy. And the comments about her being immature and needing to grow the fuck up and act like an adult. Again, real lack of empathy. No one's perfect, everyone has their own problems.",relationship_advice

The current lack of human natural selection is detrimental to progress,"Right now, there are 7.7 billion humans sharing Earth. This population is unsustainable considering the average intelligence of a human. The standard where we are now required to keep everyone alive and with basic necessities goes against the fundamental principle of how life has always worked. Why are we letting low IQ people who are addicted to drugs and on food stamps reproduce? A couple of hundred years ago, and these people are systematically taken care of by nature. Now the burden is on everyone else to take care of a growing class of idiots who will never contribute to society. Not only are they not producing, but hinder the progress of the brightest because their hard work is being sapped by the bottom 50%. No other species does this, humans are a special and remarkable species but to ignore the rules of nature has proven to be foolish. Other animals love their offspring as well, but they also understand that if their kid is too weak to independently survive, keeping him/her alive will cause their entire species to eventually go extinct. The short term value of not naturally selecting a better human population is just asking for the entire population to collapse, which will probably happen in the next couple hundred of years at this point considering how greedy humans are.

TIFU by going on my first date in years,"So usual disclaimer, this happened last week not today but I've only just recovered enough to talk about it. 

Also for context I am a detective with the police which was on my profile.

So I have been single a few months now and finally decided to give those tinder style apps a go. I was recommended Bumble by a colleague which is essentially just tinder but bee themed.

I downloaded the app Thursday and by Friday I had a date so I thought things were going well. First date I arrange for Saturday at a busy shopping centre.

Now I've been out of the dating game for a while and we were chatting about movies so we went to go to the cinema to see Mortal Engines.

I knew the first greeting was always going to be awkward, the whole ""hey is that x? 《YOU NOW HAVE 1 SECOND TO DECIDE ON KISS ON CHEEK, AWKWARD HUG OR LAME WAVE THING》 but what happened was none of those things. Instead I get hit with "" TELL ME WHO YOU ARE I NEED TO VERIFY YOU"" which not going to lie is as romantic a greeting as smearing yourself with marmite and announcing ""let's have a toast for the pretty lady!""

Anyway she then asks ""WHAT'S THAT ON THE FLOOR"" pointing to a large pile of dust. It's a pile of dust I tell her and she makes me double check.

Dust confirmed we move on to the cinema and purchase tickets the announcer in my brain exclaimes 《YOU ARE NOW LOCKED INTO THE DATE》

We got an hour and a half till the movie so we grab some ice cream cause that's cute as shit and head to Starbucks (which fyi is a crowded mutherflucker) grab a table and she leans close... zero chill just dead pan asks me ""...what's the darkest job you have ever dealt with..."" 

Now I've got some H.P. Lovecraft dark stories so I try to give her a PG version of a double murder I had some involvement with. (Note: everything I discussed could also be easily read about online)

""HOW DID HE KILL THEM? WAS THERE A LOT OF BLOOD? DID YOU SEE IT? WAS IT LIKE THE MOVIES? I LOVE MURDER STORIES, HAVE YOU SEEN MAKING A MURDERER? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT X MURDER? DID YOU KNOW THIS ONE GUY ONCE CHOPPED HIS MUM'S HEAD OFF AND HAD SEX WITH THE CORPSE ISN'T THAT FACINATING?!?!""

(Let me just remind you it's as crowded as balls in leather pants in this coffee shop and people are looking over)

She also hits me with a few probing questions ""Have you ever committed a crime? Have you ever done drugs?!""

Trying to recover some semblance of a date I joke ""haha only if you count downloading showbox as a crime""

Next it's my turn to ask some questions and throw out the classic ""Tell me about your self"" (I know it's lame but I panicked)

""Oh I've just been released from 18 months locked up in a psyche ward in Broadmoor, it was pretty much a doss and I got to meet people like naked Phillip""

Now gripped with what can only be described as the terror a double D breasted woman feels in a slasher flick I decide I have two choices.

1) Run into the crowd and disappear

2) continue date (what could go wrong in a cinema? It's just 2 hours of awkward silence)

Let's just say I chose poorly...

Before we move off though she asks me to search her chair... I don't really do much except say it's fine but after walking off she decides my efforts were not good enough and goes back to search it properly.

Finally into the cinema now 10 minutes after start time so it's adverts but most people have sat down... of course there are people in our seat, what looks like a family of 14 parts like the Red Sea so we can sit in the seats we paid for but they are somewhat miffed.

Suddenly my date whips out the flashlight on her phone and starts search the chair! The woman from the family is also some nutbar and starts yelling ""MY EYES! TURN OFF THAT LIGHT!! ARRGHHFYFBIFWYH""

my date sits down in darkness for a whole 5 minutes before deciding that she wants to have a round two of flashlight rodeo.... cue raging snickers lady ""I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOU OUT I TOLD YOU TURN THAT LIGHT OFF"" 

I'm not about to white knight defend this woman, I'm a god damn spectator here! The fruit and nut villain is eventually calmed down by her fella.

Date goes for lucky number 3 flashlight gamble, this time I have to step in and say thus is not ok.

So movie time. I'm sure Mortal Engines is a fine film... but it's pretty out there and loooong. All I'm thinking about is the 3 pieces of advice I was given prior to app dating

1) don't get drunk
2) don't send dick pics
3) don't stick your dick in crazy 

So despite the horror movie Mortal Engines has become I am still a man and she is still an attractive woman so I'm repeating number 3) again and again in my head like a monk trying to achieve enlightenment. Lucky the date is so bad and my fear so palpable that logic wins out.

After the movie she goes to the bathroom and hands me her coat and bag, can't run yet... got to wait...

She returns dead serious ""I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW ME""

this is where I die i think, I'm being lured to the bathroom to be filleted like a fish and used as a skin suit in some crazy sex game.

She walks me to an isolated area and points at an especially large pile of dust

""WHAT'S THAT?""

I say just a large pile of dust ""ARE YOU SURE, CAN YOU CHECK"" 

Sure enough it's just dust...

So keen to make good my escape I lay down a ""woah look at the time... 8:30! Got to grab that train"" she responds ""you know I'm really thirsty... could really go for a drink!""

Not willing to be the 3rd party to a human centipede I push on ""central line that's Me! Oh you too? Great..."" 

Next she smashes out a ""you know the Overground train for me is an hour wait.... I don't really want to wait an hour... so thirsty..."" 

The next stop I just decided the wrong station was the right place to be, ""oh look at This! Haha my stop lovely to meet you BYE"" 

The journey home was the most paranoia driven thriller of my 29 years...

AITA for not telling my wife that I am dying?,"Male, 31 here. For the past 15 years, I've been dealing with a medical condition that requires constant medication and consistent doctor's visits. I had always been projected to live until 50-60ish, however, a recent complication has cut that down to 12 months, 16 at best. In about 10 months, my condition should start getting a lot worse. After 12 months, I'll essentially be living in the hospital.

I am married of 4 years (no kids). I haven't had the heart to tell my wife the news. I don't even know how. We always knew I'd die younger than I wanted to, but we never expected it to be this soon.

As much as I know I should tell my wife, I don't want my last year to be plagued with an impending doom.

My wife and I have always talked about living abroad somewhere, maybe Australia, but we've never found the time or money to do so. I've been saving up to go to graduate school, however, I don't see much point in that now.

So here's my idea: take some of that money, and take my wife to Australia for a few months, and enjoy the time together. I have a job I can work remotely from anywhere, and she has a job that she can easily find work anywhere. We can work part-time, and enjoy our time together. When we get back, or maybe towards the end of it, I will break the news to her. I just wouldn't want the trip to be ruined for us by constant reminders of me dying. I know my wife, and she's very emotional - to the point where I feel like she will be crying everyday and not enjoying herself. I want this memory to be a good one for her, and not plagued by my time ticking down.

AITA for putting off telling her I am dying?

Note: I have life insurance that will take care of her, so I am not too worried about spending this money now on this trip. And I plan on talking to her about a sperm bank, just in case she decides she wants my kids in the future, as well as premised birthday cards and other things for her to have.",AmItheAsshole

The tote will be shockingly useful in a lot of surprising ways, too. One time someone hit my car, knocking my bumper half off. Luckily I had rope to tie it up and get it home. Another time I was drinking at a friends' and we all decided to go swimming. I got the gym shorts out of my car and didn't have to go swimming in my jeans/naked. I also had a towel to dry off with.

TIFU by letting our dog hang out while we did the dirty," So  my girlfriend has been working early mornings all week due to some  staff shortages, and even though we've been feeling frisky all week, we  haven't had the time. So, when Friday night rolls around, we're raring  to go.

Usually, our dog hates being near  us when we're rolling in the sheets (literally) because there's nowhere  for her to lie on the bed. So, her thing is that she curls up in her  doggie bed and waits for it all to blow over before coming back onto the  bed for cuddles.

Sparing everyone the  details, the foreplay's pretty good. Unfortunately, it's a little too  good, as for some reason our dog starts getting concerned and maybe  thinks that our sounds are distress calls or something. She hops on the  bed and starts licking my gf's face. It's cute, until she decides to  start to lick mine.

In a fit of ""oh no I  can't let her lick my lips because then I can't kiss my girlfriend  anymore"" madness, I reflexively back away... and knee my girlfriend's,  uh, nether regions in the process.

She  rolls over in pain, but she's cry laughing, and both of us just are lost  at how absurd this has been. Meanwhile, our dog, oblivious to it all,  is having the time of her life as my girlfriend is dying of pain and I try my best to comfort her.

Needless to say, I didn't get any last night. Will try again tonight, but I'll keep the dog in her crate as a precaution.

American Colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.,"According to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


In those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



Saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


Edit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

It honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. Allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",unpopularopinion
(Ohio) Woman sent me video of her setting my priceless painting (family heirloom) on fire because I called CPS on her,"My boyfriend's sister in law abuses and over medicated her autistic child so I called Child Protective services on her months ago. I was living up there near his family and long story short, when I drove home for the holidays (was just supposed to be a short trip but all hell broke loose and my boyfriend quickly packed everything we owned and followed me down a few days later) He forgot this one painting that has been in the family for over 100 years and my grandfather gave it to me before he died 14 years ago. She and her husband sent me a video saying ""this is for calling CPS, bitch."" They're both clearly seen in the video and called it a priceless painting. 

Do I have any ground to sue or press charges? I wanted to see if anyone here might have advice before I go and shell out my savings for a lawyer. This was literally my most prized possession and my heart is in so many pieces because my grandfather gave it to me so long ago. I would give everything I own just to get it back.

"People are brainwashed into thinking a 40 hour, 5 day work week is an appropriate amount of time to spend working.","The government and society want to keep us working and spending as much as possible, so obviously they can tax us all along the way.  The amount people work to spend their money on the useless shit they don't need is in my opinion unbearable.  Especially to anyone doing hard labor work.  People wake up and prepare for work, work all day often until the sun goes down, and by the time they are done washing up and feeding themselves, you literally have 1 or 2 hours of time each day to spend by yourselves. For anyone who plays a musical instrument or does any other practice time consuming art, your entire life consists of work and practice; leaving you a overworked, unhappy husk.

"LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.","The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",LifeProTips

TIFU by not finding a better place to hide my weed.,"Well thankfully this didn't happen today or yesterday.  This fuck up actually happened when I was a kid...about 16?(which is why I can laugh about it now!)  

So anyways... back in the day I used to enjoy a little bud as a high schooler.  Most of my friends did as well, but we lived in Utah at the time which means pretty much none of our parents were cool with smoking...quite the opposite in fact. 

So with our strict parents in mind as little stoner high school kids we have to think of some pretty creative ways to hide our weed. I even unscrewed my DVD player, hid weed in it and my mom still almost found it. 

This time I was going to make sure was different!   I was going to find the best place I could to hide it.  I thought to myself shortly after buying some weed for my friends birthday...""I bet hiding this outside would be perfect!""  ""She won't smell it and she never comes out here, so she won't just find it!"" So as I'm outside smoking with my friend, I feel like I hit the goldmine of weed hiding ideas! We wrap up smoking and my mom's coming home soon, so I scout the yard and decide to hide my weed in the very back of the yard, wedged in between a fence and my shed. Over top of the weed i placed a big wooden 2x4.  I go to bed happy as can be because I think I've finally won.  
So I wake up the next morning and went to school. Just another normal day.  I get home to both my parents being at my moms.  This already sets off a red flag in my mind because having divorced parents, the only time they hang out together is when someone's in trouble.
So I walk in the door to find them sitting at the table waiting for me.  At this point I'm expecting them to have find a pipe or some papers. Ha! I sit down at the table and my dad pulls out this bag of weed.  I was just like what the fuck how did you find this?!?! Do you have hidden cameras or some shit!?!?  My mom slowly starts smiling and points to my Australian Shepherd.  Apparently my dog saw me hide it, got a little curious and decided to prance around the yard with my bag of weed in her mouth right as my mom was outside having a cigarette. 

Yes I definitely got grounded.

Also, yes the dog is still alive and I'm writing this right next to the bitch!

Edit: Punctuation, Picture of the culprit http://imgur.com/WDZP2dX

Wow front page! 

Edit: For those who don't understand why my mom would be mad when she smokes cigarettes... it's because I was in high school.

TIFU by eating the green paste,"This happened yesterday. I got sushi with this girl after finally getting the courage to ask her out. (To those out there going through the struggle of feeling like you can't talk to someone you like, just do it. It's nowhere near as big a deal as you're thinking. Don't be too proud to ask your friends for advice either.) 

Anyway, this is the first time in years that I've had sushi. Everything's going well as we're just talking about school until I'm so focused on what she's saying that I pick up the tasty-looking green paste with my chopsticks without any thought to what it is. 

After I throw it in my mouth and start chewing, she pauses and asks, ""Did you just eat that whole thing of wasabi?"" 

I stop chewing as the spiciness kicks in, and I realize that I'm dumb as fuck. I figured it would've been gross if I just spit it out into a napkin right in-front of her so I keep chewing slowly instead. That doesn't help, so I grab the salmon with my sticks and start eating it along with the wasabi so that the taste isn't so bad. This doesn't help at all either and she can see me struggling to maintain.

""Drink your tea."" She suggests.

""Ah yes! Liquids! They exist!"" I think to myself. 

After this only somewhat helps, I just smile, point towards the restroom, and nod my head in hopes that I at least look cute while dying on the inside. 

The door's fucking locked. 

After this I just swallow everything left, walk back to the table, and live with the flames inside my nose. The rest of the lunch was enjoyable though. Will probably jokingly ask her if she wants to go for some wasabi next time.

TL;DR: Wasabi. Never again.

Edit: I saw Cars 2 once around the time it came out but hardly remembered any of it. I just watched the Mater scene on YouTube though and honestly I could still see myself making the same mistake had my memory of the movie been better. 

I also wanted to say many of the comments have been pretty informing as well as heartwarming. Also, those of you who've tricked your family and friends into eating wasabi are straight up evil haha.",tifu

AITA for 'promoting religion at work'?,"I'm a man with a Hindu background working in the UK - that is to say I'm not very religious but my family are and if they're doing something related I don't mind joining in. It was a Diwali this past weekend which is a pretty major festival in the Hindu religion. 

I had a lot of Indian sweets left over, and so I decided to bring 2 unopened boxes and leave them in the break room. At the end of our morning briefing, I stood up and said 'Hey, it was Diwali yesterday and so i brought in these sweets. Help yourself and happy Diwali!'. 

What was meant to be a nice gesture to ingratiate myself (I only started a fortnight ago) has left me seething after a meeting with HR. Apparently, referencing Diwali was akin to promoting a religion and therefore inappropriate at work. Apparently I'd also given out Hindu sweets (this i find ridiculous as they are just Indian sweets with no religious connotations).

To me, it's no different from saying happy Christmas which I know this company has no issue with, as evidenced by their Christmas promotional video I watched in preparation for my interview. 

To be clear I know I'm not TA for brining in sweets, my question is to do with the promoting religion bit. I'm pretty sure I did no such thing, but it's possible I'm being blinded by my own involvement in the issue.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being mad at my cousin who let her autistic son watch YouTube videos during my wedding ceremony?,"So my husband and I both have really BIG families. I originally wanted a child free wedding, but hubby thought there would be too many hurt feelings over it, especially since I did still want my little sister there as a flower girl. My cousin, Anne, has a 5 year old son, let's call him Ben, who has autism. I love Ben to death, he's a sweetheart, but he has a tendency to act out and throw long tantrums, so I was a little nervous about having him there. I tried to have a heart to heart about this with Anne as delicately as I could, but she immediately got offended and told me she ""knows how to control her son.""

So it's my wedding day. I wasn't there to hear it because I hadn't walked down the aisle yet, but our officiant makes an announcement about our unplugged ceremony preference. A pretty common practice. My dad walks me down the aisle and I'm seriously overjoyed. And then I hear it. Ben has an iPad that Anne gives him to keep him occupied. He can sit in front of it for hours watching YouTube videos about trucks. She gives it to him all the time at restaurants and stores to keep him occupied. And she also gave it to him on my fucking wedding day. 

Ben is on his iPad, watching his truck song videos at a more than audible volume and Anne is just........ letting him. It totally throws me off and I think my poor officiant saw the complete panic on my face because he stopped and did another quick ""reminder"" about our unplugged preference. Anne didn't get the hint? My husband said it was fine and told him to keep going because he doesn't like making a scene, but seriously, all I can hear is this fucking truck song and the quiet chaos going on around it. At this point, people start telling Ben to shut it off and Anne is telling them to leave him alone. My stepbrother told her to take him out, which just made Anne cry, so then I have to say my vows to the tune of Truck Tunes and my cousin crying and the uncomfortable laughter from some of our other guests.

I'd definitely consider my wedding ceremony ruined, which we put a LOT of money into, and I'm still livid about it. I didn't speak to Anne at the reception, and later SHE confronted ME about how she couldn't believe I let her and Ben be humiliated like that at the ceremony. WHAT. I went off on her. Totally lost my mind and said a bunch of shit about how she lacks any shred of awareness or common decency, among other not so nice words. My mom thinks I'm overreacting and that it really ""wasn't that bad"" and ""kind of funny if you think about it"" and that the iPad debacle was way better than Ben having a meltdown in the middle of the ceremony without it. She thinks I should apologize to Anne and basically give her a pass because she's the single mother of an autistic kid, but I just don't think it's fair to play the disability card here.

My son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family,"I'm going to preface this by saying I love all three of my sons equally. They are 29, 24 and 22. It is my unequivocal truth.

It's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

After years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and I have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. We let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

I disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

After losing literally everything after my divorce, I have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. All three of our sons work in the business.

A week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. I was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. My oldest son managed to see it.

Our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. My oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

I feel like I have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. My ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

If she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

The plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

My son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. He stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and I. Our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

I am devastated. I have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him I want the will to be changed to split everything equally. But the damage is done.

He's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). His brothers and my wife and I are so hurt hearing this. It couldn't be any further than the truth. It's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

He has refused to come in to work since the past week and I've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

I don't know how to fix this. He won't take my calls.

My ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on Facebook that I am considering legal action over. But I know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

I'm not sure how to salvage this. And I am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. My younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. It's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. My wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

TL;DR My oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. But now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after I have tried to fix it.",relationship_advice

When you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

I've hiked on mountains, I've swam in oceans, Ive been on the London eye, I've run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have I felt ""yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away""

And I'm not some anti social weirdo, I go out of my way to interact with other people. Nobody is different, at the core of it people still act like people nothing more and nothing less. Yeah sure there are differences, but they aren't interesting. A quick google search or a reddit post will tell you the major """"""""""""""""""culture shocks"""""""""""""""""""""" anyway. 

You wanna know my favorite part of traveling? The fucking trip. The plane ride, the train to the hotel, the taxi caught in traffic for 4 hours. Unironically this is my favorite part because I get to fucking sleep

Whenever someone says they love traveling I immediately think they either haven't traveled much or they are just so god damn boring they find entertainment by fucking moving the ground under their feet",unpopularopinion
AITA for deciding not to tell my family that the surgery I'm getting will probably kill me?,"I'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It's 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and I'm following all the rules. So let's say my chances of dying are 60%. That's not great but not too horrible.

The thing is that I've had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.

My family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F) who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like I'm her little boy. The only reasons I could think of to tell them would be:

1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don't think this is something they can prepare for. I'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. I don't want that.
2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because I might die soon. It would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and I'd be unhappy because I would know they're miserable.

I'm leaning towards ""ignorance is bliss"" for everyone involved. If I survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. And with My Medical Condition (TM) it's unlikely I'd make it to retirement age anyway.

But is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? What are your thoughts?

EDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.

Edit2: I've already gone over how I'd want my body dealt with the last time I had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). I have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.

Edit3: I will write letters to them.

Edit4: Maybe I wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. I'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. They're going to come see me off and we'll say our I love yous and good lucks at the hospital.

Edit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this surgery.

And YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You're all very sweet for wishing me well. It turns out Reddit isn't as scary as I feared (I just joined and this is my first post).

Edit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don't know what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. I'm going to take a break and recharge.

EDIT7: Okay I'm feeling very overwhelmed here. I was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. Now there's nearly 400 comments. I wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but I wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that I hadn't considered. After reading over 100 of these comments I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm feeling guilty for hiding this but I can't see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn't* a right thing to do.

So many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. I'm truly sorry you had to go through that and I appreciate your perspectives. I'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.

PS: To all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but I understand) you should make it for four weeks. If I survive, I'll need time to recover and get out of the ICU before I come back to Reddit.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for not letting my wife borrow my car anymore,"Hello redditors

Me and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married for about 15 years. I'm very passionated about sports cars and I own for the time being only a sports car. This led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. I care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a ""milestone"" in life that I've worked very hard for. Well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that I was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. Now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.

So I told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as I neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when I sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.

So she got really upset about this and I told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. This blew into a pretty big fight and even though I didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out I still feel like she is pissed at me. So..

Edit: To clarify: the sports car is the only car that I currently own, I used to have another car but I sold it. I've planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.

Context update:  It's not like we barely have any money to spare. She makes over $100k a year (she makes a bit more than I do). And could go and buy a car today if she wanted to. The problem is just the fact that I don't let her drive MY car which is pissing her off.

Edit 2: Saw this post blow up and thanks for all the replies. Some made me think again on how this played out and I just wanted to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on the post.

1. My wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up by her driver. Yes driver. lol. (Provided by her work).
2. She only uses the car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when she is shopping ""heavy things"".
3. We've talked several times about her getting a car which she always postpones for some reason.
4. Yes, I did ""warn"" her that I would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.
5. I do no treat my wife as a child.
6. We have our own personal things that we own, she has a horse. The horse is HERS not mine. The car is MINE not hers. I'm not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted 50/50. We also own things together of course.
7. The reason I sold my ""other"" car is that I felt I already spent so much on this new car and I didn't want to have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and her occasional shopping and some other minor things.
8. A lot of people wanna know, the car is a 2017 911 991 Turbo
9. I'm not a multimillionaire and neither is she. That is the reason for why I'm not (as some people suggests) ""go out and buy her a car and get over with it"". I saved up for many many years for the car. I don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching my budget very very far.
10. A lot of people asking regarding the ""driver who picks her up"" and it not making sense earning 100k. I'm not sure it is normal at other companies but at hers they offer this service. My wife makes well over 100k, the reason I said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove my point that she can afford a car. She makes somewhere around 250. I make around 175. We have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into ""our own"" saving accounts. This is where I during the course of many many years saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. 
11. Both the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. Nobody else but her and the concrete pillars involved.

AITA for telling a coworker that the office is NOT a daycare center?,"I work for a local government office, in a large complex with a whole lot of people. When their kids are sick or when they don't have a sitter for their kids, they take the day off from the substantial leave that we're allowed per year. My entitled coworker feels that when she doesn't have a sitter, it's perfectly fine to just bring her 5 year old in with her for the entire day. The kid ""camps out"" under this coworkers desk, laying on the floor, being constantly told to ""Ssssh"" and left to amuse herself with an ipad and toys. This coworker also does not ask our supervisor beforehand if it's alright to do this, she just brings the kid in. 

Also, when she has her kid here, numerous people come over to our office to chat and coddle the kid and ""meet"" the kid and baby talk the kid and it's really disturbing when you're trying to concentrate on writing or creating graphics for a project. 

This morning, I heard her come in and she told her kid to say hi to me. Coworkers says she didn't have a sitter today. I said, ""you mean she's here all day again?"" She said yes. I asked if she asked our supervisor if it was okay. She said, ""No, he'll know when he gets here."" I told her that the office is NOT A DAYCARE center and she should use the leave she has to stay home and watch her kid.
All day she's been whispering to people about how I'm an asshole to telling her this and how I don't like kids. I love kids. Just not in the office all damn day! Am I the Asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by not hiding my sex bag,"I had decided to reorganize my room some time ago and only made it about halfway through. My mom thought she would be nice and help clear out the clutter. Amongst my crap was the sex bag. What's a sex bag? I'm not sure if anyone else has been so clever, but I decided it would be easiest to have all the sex equipment my SO and I use in one central location, or one plastic grocery bag. You know, condoms, lube, wet wipes, etc.

I came home yesterday to find my room empty and sex bag relocated. She said nothing but it was clear she had seen and moved it. We're kind of even because she recently bought a vibrator on the family amazon prime account and accidentally used my credit cards. There is now an unspoken agreement between us to not mention it. My SO and best friend had a good laugh at my embarrassment. Just remember to hide your sex bags better.

TL;DR my mom found my sex bag but I also know about her recent vibrator purchase so we're even in the worst way.",tifu
"My girlfriend who I am living with told me I'm not good enough for her...... ""but""","So this kind of discussion has been popping up here and there for the entire year that we have been together.  We have a lot of fun together and most of the time it is great in every way. I'm 31 and she 29, not married.

We were having a general (or so I thought) conversation about relationships and what people in mixed-culture couples want and ask from each other, as well as differences between men and women.  Then she told me this:

&#x200B;

*""You are not good enough for me, but you are the best I could find. But I love you""*

&#x200B;

A little more background: I'm north european and she is from central asia which means we have some cultural differences to overcome. We have been living together in my apartement for most of the time that we have been together. I work and make decent money in engineering and she makes twice of what I make.

&#x200B;

She wants me to get a better job so that I make as much as she does, or almost, or more. What bothers me is that she wants me to make money so that I will be able to provide her with money to pursue her hobby in fashion and buy her dresses and the jewelry she want, when she for some reason gets unemployed. She believe it is natural for the man to pay for everything in the relationship (including house, food, car, expenses etc) while she spends her money on herself, and then contributes whatever she feels like, even when working and making twice what I make. For me the natural thing is to share expenses, and contribute more or less equally since we are a couple and live together. This is very hard for her to understand. From my point of view she seems entitled to special treatment.

There are more issues...  she told me that she told her ex that he had a small dick, she called her other ex worthless when he was depressed. So I basically worry she will treat me the same way if I won't be her little dog. That's the feeling I get.

What is going on here? I'm just trying to understand...or rather figure out if it is worth staying. Thanks people.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:  Thanks for all the comments. First reddit post so this is very cool.This post was all about the bad, crucial stuff and the stuff she would start a silent and stubborn tantrum about.The good things in this relationship is that she seems very caring and attached to me, tries to understand all these differences in culture. She is very honest and we have a great time on a day-to-day basis, laughing, fooling around, sex and more.

I just can't get my head around her expectations. Is it just ""cultural differences"" that I can accommodate to some degree or is it her deep character...One of you said this about her thinking:   "" your money is 'our' money and her money is her money"" ( [FirstFarmOnTheLeft](https://www.reddit.com/user/FirstFarmOnTheLeft) ) ....which is spot on. That mindset bothers me a lot.

"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case. I did nothing wrong.","Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

I was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.

When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and I was released.

What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

EDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told ""good luck"". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",legaladvice
"[FINAL UPDATE] My [29M] fiancee [28F] of 4 years randomly claimed I abused her, and called the police. This came completely out of the blue.","Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
Update post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

So firstly thanks for all of your input. I read and considered every single reply. First I'll update you, then I'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. I want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, I'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and I feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

Update: 

I spoke to her in person after I posted my update. From her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. Her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. She was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""I don't know, I'll probably tell him that I feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. Then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

I said great, all that is understandable. Just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

She said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

I thanked her for telling me, and then I called off the wedding entirely. 

She cried, I cried, it was a goddamn mess. She asked where we go from here. I told her I don't know. I don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but I know that the engagement is over, and that **if** I decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. And now I have to decide if **I** want that. Do I went to spend another 4 years being undecided? If I'm being honest with myself, I imagine it taking another couple of years before I can trust her again. Do I want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? Close to 40? 

I told her that I have a lot to think about. 

I spoke to her dad last night. We shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. My ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. She's been crying a lot. I do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

Her dad caught wind of the situation on Facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. He'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. She told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. He told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. He said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

So that's it. I still have a lot to think about. I know a lot of you guys are telling me that I have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that I still love her and have loved her for a few years now. Right now, I'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

As for my reputation, nobody thinks I'm an abuser. It's firmly out there now. Her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. I haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. There's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

My family agrees with a lot of you. They're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. Just give me some time. I'm not going to make another update post, because I've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe I'll just update this post in a few days after I've decided what to do.",relationship_advice

Here's a quick update. You guys all really hyped me up so thanks for the thousands of pep talks, I wouldn't have been able to muster up the courage on my own. So I told him that I didn't enjoy sex. I could tell by his face that he already knew it wasn't fun for me and he was frustrated I brought it up. 

basicallyyyy I asked him to please do something for me for once or I can't do it anymore. I don't like giving ultimatums or being confrontational like that especially knowing he is in a tough spot. But He agreed to touch me over my underwear but he was very obviously trying to distract himself when I was getting wet by kissing me. He was upset afterwards and locked himself in the bathroom. I couldn't help but cry like it felt so fucked up, how does he get me off and then go hide in the bathroom. and he heard me so he came out and I said I hated him. Not the most constructive thing to say but I couldn't help it. He said he couldn't do that again and offered opening up the relationship so I could have sex with other guys and get oral from them. 

I do NOT want to be in a polygamous relationships. I am a strictly monogamous type of girl. I don't want 2 boyfriends. So I told him that wasn't an option and he just shrugged. I asked him if he was gay and he said no. I asked if he was sure or if he had a traumatic experience or if he's trying to get out of doing the work. he told me we can break up if I want since he wouldn't answer my questions. And when I told him ok it's over, he started crying and I asked him to please tell me what was wrong and he said no. 

Basically we broke up. I wanna help him and figure out what's wrong but he doesn't wanna open up so there. I didn't think he'd get emotional but yeah",relationship_advice
[MA] Landlord let new tenant move into my vacant unit DURING my lease,"EDIT: Thanks everyone for the sanity check. I was originally a bit annoyed but considering letting this slide along with the return of my entire deposit + my A/C unit, but now I think I may go for more. Contacted a couple firms in my area to see what the next steps are.

tldr - I had overlapping leases and left my old unit vacant for a month but with a few items still there. I showed up today to do final cleaning and pick up my items and the unit was remodeled and the new tenants things were stored in the closets. My things were gone. What is my recourse?

-----

I have overlapping leases, one of them ends Aug 31st. I moved out of that unit last week of July. I was in contact with the new tenant moving in Sept 1st and he was unwilling to pay to move in early so I told him as a courtesy he could move in Aug 31 free of charge. I then left some cleaning supplies and an AC unit at my old unit, just using it as storage as I lived at my new place. I let my landlord know I was planning on moving out early and that I'd let them know when they could do a walk-through to assess the unit, and they said ""okay, let us know."" That was the last communication I had with them.

I went to my old unit today to retrieve my things and they were all gone and the unit was remodeled. The new tenant had also stored his belongings in my closet. I paid full rent for August and they did all of this without my consent or notifying me at all. They kept the AC unit and have offered to deliver it to my new address but all my cleaning supplies ($50) are gone.

I talked with the landlord and she claims the new tenant called once a day claiming I said they could move in early and the landlord eventually caved and let them. What is my recourse here? It seems insane they thought they could do all of this without my consent. I assume I am at least entitled to my full security deposit back as I was not here to confirm any damages, but what more could I hope for if I decided to take legal action?

Last communication I had with landlord was on 8/13 where I said 

""I'll let you know in the next week or two when the unit is ready for a walk through, I have a couple things still there and have to finish cleaning.""

And she said that was fine.",legaladvice
AITA for refusing to lift something heavy for a woman as a man?,"I was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while I was working at my desk, but when I got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. I was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while I was working just because I was the nearest available man, so I refused. The other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought I was joking, so I kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. I thought one of them should have done it in the first place.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: To clarify, the women in the break room weren't on official breaks. They just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. There are no official break times in my workplace. Also, I was working on something at my desk when I was asked to lift said object.

Edit 2: At the time of being asked, I was asked to help ""lift something"" in the break room. I assumed it was a package of mail or paper and I didn't know I'd be doing it myself, nor did I know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.

Edit 3: This was not the first time in the day I refilled the dispenser. I'm the closest man who sits near the break room, so I'm regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. However, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn't exactly petite either — none of them in the break room are. Furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it's placed on the dispenser. I have also witnessed a 4'11"" woman change the bottle, so height isn't exactly much of an issue here.

Edit 4: The woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. She is also married with children and I'm the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, I highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.

Edit 5: I never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume I did. I just refused to do the task for her.

Edit 6: I am not the strongest person in the office — far from it. I don't lift weights and stay slim out of preference. We even have some female gym fanatics here. Also, I barely know the woman who asked me. She's in another department in another part of the office.

UPDATE: I very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. She still defends chivalry, while I obviously find it illogical. Our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. Yes, everything I posted happened almost a decade ago. Our discovery sparked a heated discussion and I wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others' viewpoints to close our debate. I put little effort in my original post without thinking I'd get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.

I'm still employed with this company, and some involved have left. If there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. I'm glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. It's no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and I am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men.

TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.,"Obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

I had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! Or so I thought. 

About 3 weeks after our proposal, I notice she starts acting different. Not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. She had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of M-F each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. I went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when I have work the next day, so I often opted out.

We would also share our google location with each other at all times. Mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and I would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. I looked at her location one day and it was turned off. I texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. Hadn't been a problem for the past year. She turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. She also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. I only had the location for the personal phone. Eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

Two days ago, about a month after the proposal, I decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and I just wanted to put it to rest. I used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. She had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. I called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. She said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

I waited until she got home and confronted her about it. She said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought I would get mad. Turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. I kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time I asked.

The next day when I got home from work, I asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. She said she deleted them. So I said I wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. I started recovering the data from the last backup. She sat down beside me while I was doing it, and asked what I was doing. I told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! So she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. I asked her one last time, ""before I look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" She was silent. I asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. Turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. Funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. So that's a win I guess.

Planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. Havn't told her yet. Still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. Feels shitty but I'm keeping my head up.

TLDR; TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. It has been one month since the proposal now.

A woman on a train is refusing to let a tired soldier sit down,"An American soldier, serving in World War II had just returned from several weeks of battle on the German front lines.

The soldier had been granted rest and relaxation and was on a train that was bound for London.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat.

The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog.

The weary soldier asked, ""Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?""

The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?""

The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again.

Again, the soldier asked, ""Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.""

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!""

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand, you drive your autos on the wrong side of the road and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window!.""

I'm disgusted.  It was her ex, whom I've always felt inferior too like she just hadn't gotten over him even after over a year.

I'm distraught.  I don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  My two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into Uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.  My family and I don't even get along nor communicate much.  I lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

She's REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn't know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  I had to do it.  I told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don't know how to cope with this.  I can't eat.  I can't sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and I'm just disgusted.  I'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

I snooped on my brother and found something horrifying,"I just found something pretty disturbing, and I'm not sure what really to do next.

My brother is usually a super private person and doesn't hand out his phone to anyone. We're currently on a family vacation overseas and he is the only one with a working data plan, so we've been using is phone quite a bit. His open web tab was on a popular fiction website, and I saw his logged in username before he swapped tabs to a new one.

I frequent the site too, and when back in the airbnb, went to check his profile to see if he too ran in the same fandoms as me. I must admit that this situation is entirely my fault as I snooped. I know I shouldn't have, but I was so curious. To my surprise, he had a few published works, but when I opened one, I almost puked - his latest story was of a brother violently raping his sister in graphic detail, who had the same first name and general description as me, in a setting I recognised as my parent's house. He insulted my eldest sibling and also my parents in horrible ways too. I won't go into further detail but suffice to say it was the single most horrifying thing I've ever read. Ever.

Now I'm in the bathroom of this airbnb typing this and I'm not sure how I'm going to go out and face my family. Should I just ignore this? Is this normal and am I overreacting? I mean, everyone has their kinks and my brother has never, ever acted inappropriately towards me or anyone in my family in real life. Please tell me this is so.

Urgh. Moral of the story, don't snoop, never ends well.

Edit: I am 19F and my brother is 23M.

**Update**: Thank you to those who replied, I still have no idea what I'm going to do. I really do get that it is fiction, and I completely understand that part of the appeal is to push characters to extremes because it would never happen in real life. It would not have disturbed me at all if the people involved were literally any other fictional character, emphasis on the fictional. All I expected when I searched his profile was to find a list of his favorite fics and thought we could discuss any shared fandoms, and I know I shouldn't have gone looking. Didn't expect him to be an author, much less this. Sorry for the long para, it's late at night and I can't bring myself to sleep in the same room as my brothers, might just crash on the couch where I am at now. Also I'm planning to beg off tomorrow's planned tour, will catch up on sleep then.

"If your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her.","For the record, I'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

What I am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. She had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200B;

There are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200B;

The first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. He is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. I know, crazy right?

&#x200B;

The second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. You are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. Does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200B;

Now, Reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200B;

1. No guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. I'm not saying that a guy should say ""Do this for me, or I'm leaving."" I'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. That relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. This obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, I only picked men and sex because I tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. Obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. If both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then I guess it's a match made in heaven.

&#x200B;

EDIT: **Holy shit! Gold! OMFG!!!**

EDIT2: ***""I would like to thank the academy...""***

EDIT 3: I'm gonna fuck off for a (long) while, but I keep getting the same question so I'll answer it here:

&#x200B;

This post was inspired by myself and a group of guys talking about our past relationships and the commonalities we noticed with each other.

For me, it was a girl in high school who refused to kiss me (we did everything else but no kissing), but admitted to me that she'd kissed her ex a lot. I dumped her. Girls I've been with since haven't held back like that (at least not that I was aware of.)

Another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

Another guy wasn't getting blowjobs, but found out from a mutual friend that his girlfriend loved giving them to an ex.

"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",Jokes
AITA for not giving my husband a baby right now,"So we've been married for just shy of 3 years now and my husband is really getting on my case to have a baby.

I've stated that I do want to have kids but not right this second. My main concern is that there is A LOT in instability and uncertainty in our lives right now. His job has taken us to live in Europe for 3 years and in a year we will be moving again, but we don't know where to yet. I want to wait until there's a little more certainty in life and to know that I'm going to have a good support system in place because he travels for work for long periods of time. His response to all of that is ""I don't want to wait anymore"" and ""people do this all the time"" and ""it's not fair to him"" 

Now I understand that there is no perfect time to have babies however I'm a firm believer that if your gut is telling you that it's not a good time, then it's not a good time

UPDATE: honestly I'm surprised on how fast post took off. I am seeing a lot of the same INFO requests. So let me clarify.
Age: me 33, him 30
We did have extensive discussions prior to and after our marriage. We both agreed that we wanted to have time together before we brought kids into the picture. He was planning on switching careers to create a more stable life to start a family. He has since changed his mind on that which means lots of moving and moving away from friends and family for the foreseeable future. As for my education, that was also discussed extensively but was put on hold because of financial constraints. Until lately.

Correcting someone elses child's disrespectful behavior should be acceptable,"I was recently at a party and one of the partygoers brought their child. I have nothing against kids but this little one was being an outright menace. He started screaming and crying when the cake was being served because he wasn't the first one to get cake and then flipped his mom off when she asked him to stop. He's four. It was extremely uncomfortable because Mom did nothing and awkwardly stood there and just let this happen. Party continues and he then is pitching golf balls at a window. My fiancé asks him nicely to stop (there were other kids nearby who she didn't want caught in the crossfire) and the mom went ballistic on her saying ""don't tell my kid how to act"" etc. If you can't be bothered to instill good behavior into your kid I feel like you shouldn't be insulted when other people do it for you

Edit: Hi everyone! So I wanted to quickly edit the main post because I've noticed a trend in people saying that physical reprimands on other people's children is okay, and I absolutely DO NOT approve of that in any way shape or form.

"Me [18M] and 9 other friends [18M] on holiday in Spain. One friend won't pay for the Villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. Shall we kick him out?","Okay so it's essentially the title but I'll try to explain it as best as I can. Names have been changed. 


There are 10 of us in total. 8 of us in the Villa, and 2 have an apartment near our Villa. 


1) Harry was going to come. 


2) Harry cancelled around 1 week before we were going to come, so we didn't know until then that he wasn't going to come. 

3) Zack was going to come. 


4) Zack cancelled around 1 month before we were going to come, so we had plenty of time to find a replacement. 


5) Hank and Mark replaced them but none of us were told, one guy literally invited them out of nowhere, and none of us are that close with both of them. They both said Yes. 


6) He asked them both, even though at that time only Zack had cancelled. They both said Yes, so they decided Hank stay in the Villa, and Mark would get an apartment near us as well. 


7) Hank is replacing Zack. At this point we didn't know Harry wasn't coming. 


8) Hank is booked in for the villa, he pays all the money like everyone else (£240 just for Villa for 1 week). 


9) As we didn't know Harry was going to cancel, Mark books his own little apartment near to the other 2 people. 


10) Harry cancels around 1 week before we're about to leave. 


11) Without the rest of us knowing Mark refund his apartment, and decides to just stay in our villa, even though we've told the villa owner there's 7 of us only, since Harry cancelled. 


12) We had to show and sign documents showing our passports, and documentation basically to confirm there is only 7 of us staying in the villa. 


13) So, the only thing Mark has paid for is is own flight which is £160. 


14) So, he needs to pay around £240 for staying in the villa for 1 week, like everyone else has.
 

15) The rest of us only found out yesterday that he hasn't paid, but he's already said to 2 other people, he's not gonna pay because ""ITS EASIER FOR ME"". 


16) He goes ""I'm doing you guys a favour by taking the extra spot that Harry was gonna go on"" ?!?!?!


17) Also, basically because Harry isn't coming we all decided to do something nice and all give him the refundable deposit for the villa which was £250 which means between us we are paying like £35 for the deposit. By doing this we are minimising the amount of money he loses, since some of the things he paid was non-refundable.  


18) If you think about it, if Mark paid, we would all get our deposit back. But he's not, and the deposit that's going to Hank, is covering £250 worth of the shit at the villa. The villa that Mark is staying at free of charge because it's ""easier"". 


19) So we are literally paying £250 to Mark essentially  and he is saying ""im doing you guys a favour"". We are basically paying for his holiday, and losing money ourselves. 


20) So yeah we are going to ask him to pay later on otherwise he's not staying in the villa he can actually fuck off and find some other accommodation. Do you think that's fair? But we really don't want to put him out on the streets, but we don't know how else to get him to pay. 


21) If he says he will pay after the holiday, he literally and simply just won't, he will be lying, and after the holiday is done there's nothing that we can do really. 


22) How can we get him to pay? If he pays that means we can all get our refundable deposit back too, which is around £35 per person which would be nice too. 


23) 2 people have asked him to pay already, and he told them all to Fuck Off. We know for a fact that he has the money, so that's not the issue. He himself has money in his account, and his family is also decently well off, like not poor or anything. 

EDIT : Some confusion, we are in Spain right now. It's been 3 of our 7 days. 


What can we do? HOW CAN WE GET HIM TO PAY?

"LPT: Genuinely caring about somebody a lot, does not guarantee they care about you equally (or at all) in return. Some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say. So don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them.","This is something that I unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - It may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  Most of my life I thought if I really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. It always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. Despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, I would do everything I could to make them happy. I would go out of my way to help them, say & do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  I'd think ""how could they not care about me when I make it so obvious how much I care about them? If I just keep trying they'll come around"".  This was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.

What I've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. The amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. People can and will use you and your emotions. And just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words. 

I'm not talking about classic ""nice guy"" syndrome. Not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...I'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. Whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.

I wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. I'd be convinced I could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if I was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. Looking back I should have cut my loses far sooner. I should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.

Its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.You can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.

*********

**Edit** I should note, I don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return. There is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). But you can't expect them to some day change their minds. And you shouldn't let your desire to please people who don't care about you distract you from finding people who do.",LifeProTips
"TIFU By having, what is hopefully, the strangest sexual experience I encounter. NSFW","Literally happened a half hour ago.

Husband and I have been together 15 years.  We are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  Nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.

He asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  I did.  Unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  It was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.

I walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  He's not home 90% of the year because of work so I, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  I thought ""I'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls"".  

He's loving it.  I'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.

I feel something as I'm making circles with my tongue.  No big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so I quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  As I pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) I glance at it.  It's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  It took a half a second to realize that I had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.

TIFU- By not knowing about sunblock expiration dates,"I applied SPF 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. I was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

I pretty much had no idea that I had a problem until I scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. I considered for a split second that I had a burn but like an idiot, I rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

The blisters formed by the next day and I started reading the can to see if I missed something about applying it. I found the customer service number and called it. Before talking to anyone, I heard a recording tell me that the FDA doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. This bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

I had no clue. 

I went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

It was easily one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. Trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. I soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


This was preventable- Sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions.

 https://imgur.com/3nge8Nm.jpg 


EDIT- I want to clear up: I'm naturally, very pale person, I was at high altitude while on and in the water. I do not blame anyone but myself for this. Whether expired or I stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. I should have been careful with making sure the things I use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
I agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, I just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
This isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

I'm not planning to sue anyone although I appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
I just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! Be safe! Skin cancer is a real danger.

Fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick,"I'm SO sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/HAES movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. I'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but I'm well inside the 'normal' BMI range (BMI of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. I work out, I eat healthy, I have learned to control my urges and I take pride in taking care of my body. It irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  Because of this, I find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me I'm curvy or thick. FFS, you're fat! If you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. Rant over. 

EDIT: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why I care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. Fat is fat. Not curvy, just fat. There are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on YouTube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). I simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. Thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations.

AITA for kissing my ex-girlfriend before her parents pulled her off life support?,"About a year ago, my ex-girlfriend (I'll call Anna) was involved in a terrible car accident. She received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). She had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. I was devastated to  hear her go through this.  Despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. 

After months of visiting Anna, sitting by her, I was getting drained. Her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that I shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (I am 20yo). So after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in God, I put myself back out there. I eventually met a new girl who I loved (Katie), and I saw a lot of traits in her that I saw in my ex. 

A few days ago (May 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. At first I was extremely upset, but realized Anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). Katie knew about Anna and it was no surprise to her I wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. When I got there, I kissed Anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her I loved her. After the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. I kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""I love you). 

At the funeral I gave her a eulogy (which Katie attended) and told Anna again ""I love you.""

After the funeral, Katie was angry with me. She asked what I mean't when I said ""I love you, Anna."" Then I told her about the kiss  because I felt guilty. Now, Katie is now super pissed at me. She is staying with her parents and said I cheated on her. This was not my intention at all though, I just wanted Anna to know (if she was even conscious) that I loved her, and would see her again. The kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, I wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time.

TIFU by helping a stranger change his tire in the middle of the night,"This happened 2 years ago, it was saturday night 2am, i went out with some friends and they dropped me off about 40feet away of my car, no big deal, i'm a 20 yo man and the street had good light. When i approached my car i noticed it was unlocked and my glove compartment's stuff was scrambled all over the car. I got my phone and dialed the police number but when i was about to call i was approached by a young man with a hoodie that was in the car behind me, he asked me if i had a wheel wrench to change his tire because he had a flat tire. I said ""yeah sure but first let me call the police, my car got mugged"" but he insisted that i didn't called the police because he was drunk driving.

He kept insisting and i didn't want any trouble so i got my wheel wrench and gave it to him, and indeed his car had a flat tire but something seemed odd, he kept insisting to help him but i was just looking at him with the feeling that something was off and i didn't knew what it was. 2 minutes passed and shit just hit the fan, suddenly 1 car that was coming at high speed breaks right next to me and 4 middle age men got out screaming ""WTF YOU THINK YOU DOING?"" in my mind i just tought ""well, this is how i die"". Behind me the young man who was changing the tire starts running and no one follows him because they have me. 1 of them grabed me by the neck, threw my phone away and pushed me to the car yelling several times ""DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!?"" while the others are puching my head. I was scared to death because i didn't knew what was going on and just said i didn't knew anything and tried explaining my point of view wich non of them believed. They said if i didn't tell them who my ""friend"" was i would get beaten up even more. 2 more cars stops and at this point it's about 15 people around me screaming and threating me. One of them mentions that they called the police and i was more relief. Police came and they took me to their van were i explained everyting, they understood my situation and said i was free to go and that i could file a complaint for assault. I got in my car, still having people screaming at me and drove to the police station where i filled a complaint against the man who assaulted me. It was several weeks later that the police explained me that the man i helped was a criminal and the vehicle had been stolen. The men that were screaming and the man who assaulted me was friends of the owner of the vehicle. Got me an attorney and i'm about to go to court next week, i will update soon.

Sorry for any spelling mistake, english is not my first language.

Edit 1: WOW this blew up!! Thank you all for your support! To clarify, he *said* he was drunk driving, but was just an awful excuse, he didn't seemed drunk but he seemed capable of knocking me off if i insisted.

Edit 2: My first gold and silver!! Thank you!!! So to clarify even more, yes shit took this long to go to court. My attorney spoke with the attorney of the guy who assaulted me and their attorney said I should drop the case that is a lost case for me LOL we'll see about that.. Thank you all once again and I will update asap!

Edit 3: COURT DAY! What happened was that their attorney said that the best to do was making a deal, because he didn't have much money to pay and it would take months and the law-court couldn't make sure he would paid me. What my attorney advised was to go with the deal of half the value of we propose and he would pay right now, so I had 2 options: 
1. Condemn him at court, the judge probably would make him pay, maybe a less value and he would have a criminal record which could have repercussions on me, and even if the value was more then half he didn't have any money or possessions and it would take time of him to pay.
2. He would pay half the amount right there and make an apology to me.

I went with the second option, got some cash, he made an apology and we went with our lives. 
I hope the fact that he needed to get a lawyer and go to court served as a lesson

Accused of sexually abusing my infant son by batshit MIL.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Bear with me.

My insane Christian MIL hates me. I listen to Metallica and Megadeth, therefore I am the reincarnation of Lucifer.

Yesterday I was changing our son's (6 months old) nappy, he had poop all over the place, because he's a baby. I cleaned around his anus and my MIL shreaked at the top of her lungs:

""You just sexually abused your son! You fucking vile pig."" Our son, obviously almost jumped off the changing table with shock and was in hysterics. 

MIL started slapping me around the back of the head, shoulders and back.

Wife came in and almost had to carry MIL out of the room. I'm in a state of shock, I have to calm our son down and finish cleaning him. Can hear MIL and FIL raging in the background. Hear the front door slam.

MIL now says she's calling CPS and has reported the ""sexual abuse"" of our son.

What's my recourse here? When CPS show up, do I bar them from entering and explain the waste of time they're in for? Do I let them in? Do I hire a lawyer and look for a cease and desist?

I'm worried about letting CPS in because people have told me that they will take a dim view of me (the father) being the one looking after him while my wife is working. Is there any truth to that?

I'm fairly certain she will call CPS because she has called the police on me in the past for driving my wife's car.

"In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket...","

As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

 Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. 

Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! 

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. 

With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. 

Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""

At this, the Texan drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""",Jokes
whats the most hurtful thing you've overheard about yourself by accident?,,AskReddit
[NY] I found out my parents have most-likely been stalking me. What do I do?,"I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbnnqn/someone_has_tried_to_impersonate_me_and_those/) yesterday asking for help because I thought someone who may want to hurt me may be impersonating me by sending messages to my contacts, interfering with my relationships, and causing trouble at work.

&#x200B;

After posting, I shared what happened to a small group of people, who started sleuthing through what-ifs. They thought that my ex-boyfriend may be behind the behavior and the app we found, but it didn't add up to me. They suggested that I look through old text messages to see if I could determine where I went that day (e.g., if I had met up with him and he had access to the phone). I used my Google Location data to find out where I was on the date and time of the app installation, and it turns out I was at my parents' house.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, most of these things make sense. My dad has a history of financial interference and abuse.  Three years ago, he opened a series of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and refused to pay. He ruined my credit. My mother begged me not to go to the police, so I didn't. Instead, I paid them off and worked very hard to rebuild my credit. He promised to pay me back and has not paid a dime to this day. 

 My parents have both expressed discontent with me considering my former landlord ""family"". They were quite vocally upset when I broke from the shared family phone plan, and opened a new plan with two of my sisters. They blamed me for influencing those sisters (who are both adults) to move out on their own. They are very conservative Muslims who disagree with my lifestyle. I feel as if they tried to interfere so that I would have no one left, and have no choice but to come home to them, as moving home until I get married is something that they've begged me to do for years.

&#x200B;

What legal recourse should I take now? I instructed my sisters to also scan their phones. One of them found similar stalkerware, while the other did not.

We have younger siblings who still live at home, so my sisters are hesitant to do anything that may get my parents sent away/harm my younger siblings' relationship to our parents.

[31] Overweight husband lost a lot of weight and now I'm [27F] insecure,"My husband and I have been married for 3 years and were dating for 2 and a half before that. In the beginning, we were both really in shape and met while training for a half marathon. About a year into our relationship (and a year before getting married) we had both gotten complacent and sedentary since our jobs were unexpectedly demanding and we gained a lot of weight. My husband went from a BMI of 20 to 26 and I went from a BMI of 19 to 27, so we both were overweight when we got married.

Over the course of our marriage, I've been gaining more weight and he's been steadily losing. I've been proud of him and trying to lose weight by joining him at the gym again and picking up running but he brought one of his gym friends home for dinner and I just felt so horrible.

After all his weight loss/working out, he's in the best shape I've ever seen him and his abs are starting to be more and more visible. His gym friend is in better shape than I have ever been; she's skinny and tall and has like 18% body fat and I just feel so horrible.

Police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him,"This happened last week, he's only 11. At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

They then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).

We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.

We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).

We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""Creepers"" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. What the hell do we do?

Edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",legaladvice
My(39m) daughter (16f) came out today and my wife(39f) cannot take it.,"This is very embarrassing to put up on my original account so please excuse me for posting from a new account.

We have been married for 17 years, together since high school. We have three children - a son and two daughters (17m,16f&12f). We all have an amazing relationship and we are super close with our children. 

Next week we are hosting a dinner for a special occasion. Everyone from our families is invited. My son's girlfriend is invited too.

So, yesterday my daughter (16f) wanted to talk to me and my wife privately. She basically told us that she was gay and we were the only people she confessed to. She wanted to invite her girlfriend over for the dinner. I must admit that I felt happy because my daughter chose to confide in us. The fact that she was comfortable talking to us about it made me proud. Somehow it made me feel like a good father. 

I reassured her that it was not something to be ashamed of and she would have our full support. This is when my wife exploded. She yelled at my daughter that she was 16 and she's just confused. She asked her she should date boys first because she can't claim to be gay without going out with boys. She also told her that no one in our families is gay( this isn't true and I'll elaborate on this later) and there was zero possibility of my daughter being one. She told her that she was not allowed to meet this girl and she didn't want freaks in her house. 

I was so angry at this point. My daughter was crying and apologizing for letting us down. I basically told my wife to keep her bigoted views to herself and took my daughter out for some alone time. I just reassured her that I would always support her every decision and be there for her and she could talk to me about anything. After we got home she went straight to bed. 

My wife didn't want to talk and told me that I loved my daughter more than her. She told me that she was the one who supported me through all my struggles and was always there for me. After that she just told me that she'd divorce me if I encouraged freaks. I was so taken aback by her behavior. This was totally out of character for her. 

Now, before painting my wife as homophobic, I think I know where this is coming from. Her brother came out to their family as gay. His parents supported his decision but he ended up taking his life because he was bullied. None of the children kniw about this and it was a very traumatic incident for her family. I asked her if thus was about her brother and she told me that he was nuts and refuses to talk to me.

How do I approach this. I want to be there for my daughter but I want my family. I want my wife to accept my daughter's choices. I feel like she just gave me an ultimatum. How do I make things better?

Edit1: Some of you have asked if this was the first time my wife expressed her views on homosexual people. No. We have friends who are gay and she was totally fine with them. 

Edit2:She loved her brother and was shaken by his death. I'm not privy to the exact details because no one in her family is comfortable discussing that but I know that he took his life because he was bullied. So my wife thinks that my daughter has to endure all this and she's upset. 

Edit3: And no. We are not doing any conversion therapy or anything like that. I will stand by my daughter alone if necessary.

TX - My pregnant ex girlfriend is told several lies about me and got me arrested. Kid was born and turns out not my kid. She just called me.,"Ex was a one night stand with no protection. She gets pregnant and we assume its mine. 

Things go to shit and we break up. Talk of custody and child support comes up and I tell her I was going to try for custody.

Three hours later I am picked up for questioning. I refuse to answer any questions, get a lawyer after release and find out I have a restraining order against me. 

The kid is born. DNA test is done and its not mine. 

Since all of this started I have been recording all phone calls on my cell phone because CYA has literally saved my job. 

I just got a phone call from an unknown number. It was my ex. She said since she was using a friends phone and wanted to apologise. I told her we should not be talking. She agreed and apologized for lying to the police about the rape. 

I immediately hung up the phone. I have her on recording admitting to false Rape reports to the police. 

Will I get in trouble for this? I made no effort to call her and she called me. The call lated 1:28 seconds and I hung up on her.

My [F28] MIL won't take my kid's [4] anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously,"**UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF POST.**

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Sorry for mobile formatting. I've never really seen eye-to-eye with my MIL because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... I understand that children need discipline, but I prefer a gentler approach with my son. I've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists I let it go, so I've tried to. 

Until now. My son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. She insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that I'm just babying him. I've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

She has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. I told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying I accused her of being an unfit grandmother. Which I admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

Now my husband wants me to apologise to her. He says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that I'm overreacting. I kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is OF THE ESSENCE because it happens so quickly. 

So, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

She's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a LOT of peanuts, everywhere. I asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

I'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a Mama's boy who thinks Mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. He says he turned out just fine being raised by her and I worry too much. 

Would it be awful if I insist she only see him if I'm present? Am I completely unreasonable and overreacting? Is there anything else I can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**EDIT/MINI-UPDATE**: First of all, woah. I did not expect this to get so much attention. Thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. In case you missed it: I'VE LEFT FOR NOW, removed my son from the situation, and I'm now currently staying at my brother's house. At least for a few days until things cool off and I'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. In the mean time, I've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). Unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. My husband has been to the same appointments I have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

Some people have accused me of being a helicopter Mom, or trying to demonize my MIL. And given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe I'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then I'm okay. I'm not even a SAHM, we have an incredible nanny while I work FT, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. In the past, I've tried my best for my MIL to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, I've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. But I'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

Lastly, I just want to say my MIL has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. She won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. So, I don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. She's very strong in her beliefs. I did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. My husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so I told him to find time or he won't be getting ANY time with my son until he does. If he's going to be so careless, I'll end up dealing with this legally.

My landlady lives in terror of her meth-addict son, and lies to the police to cover for him. Sick situation. He came back to live with his mom, decided he wanted my apartment, tried bullying me out. Attacked me twice. Gaslighting me, terrorizing me for months. I got an assault charge finally and order of protection is going through this weekend. Mother's Day he came into my apartment with his mom's key, held me down, threatened my life, pushed me out. I came back a day later to my entire apartment packed up. Meth heads love menial tasks. All doors off hinges, including main door.

Cops come. He speaks for his mom, says 'Officer, he helped us pack.' Yeah, right.

I'm getting my stuff and just moving. This is too crazy to deal with. Not even going to fight it anymore. I did nothing wrong, he'll get my apartment, his mom will lose the rent she was making from me. Good riddance. It's a gorgeous, cheap studio, but not worth this level of insanity.

I know this guy is a thief. He bragged to me about how he steals a couple of times. I just know he'll have taken some of my things. I'm sure he'll have taken my nicest things, like my really nice-quality American flag, my box of old camcorder tapes I made growing up, my camera. I just know it.

Once I figure out what's missing--whether it's something expensive or something priceless for sentimental reasons, like 40 camcorder tapes full of footage... what do I do?

AITA for telling my relatives not to talk to my young daughter about boys or her looks?,"I have a daughter, Emma, who is 6 going on 7, going into second grade in the Fall. I'm her mom, so of course I think she's beautiful, but realistically she is exceptionally very pretty and it's the thing everyone comments on about her, which bothers me AND her. People also always tie that to her 'breaking boys' hearts' or teasing her about boyfriends or marrying boys. She's not even 7 years old yet, but people have been saying this type of stuff since she was a baby.

Emma has never liked this, and since kindergarten if someone says she's pretty she'll say, 'I'm kind and smart too' or 'I am a good helper and like to share too.' She also gets upset and draws inward when people tease her about breaking boys' hearts or having a boyfriend. Since she was maybe two years old she has always talked about marrying girls and thinking boys are icky, take that as you will; we are. We don't expect a little child to have her sexuality figured out but we also don't want to make a big deal about it or 'correct' her in case she does end up wanting to marry a woman.

So long story short, after Easter, I sent an e-mail out to our family and close friends asking them if they could ease up on talking about her appearance and teasing her about boys after she cried that night because her Grandma said she'd have to marry a boy and she didn't want to. You'd think I asked my family to cut off limbs or eat a pile of dog doo based on the response and things have been tense since, with lots of passive aggressive comments about how I 'won't let them say ANYTHING' and how what they're saying is 'normal.' Her paternal grandparents responded that they are going to 'just skip' her birthday party in case they 'offend' me.

My husband (and my brother and his sister) are the only ones who don't think I'm being an asshole here, but now my extended family makes me think I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but these comments really do upset Emma a lot, so I don't know what to do here.

EDIT: Since a bunch of people have asked, this is the e-mail sent to our families:

""Just a head's up, we're trying something new. Emma has told us that it upsets her when people compliment on her appearance or tease her about boys, so we'd all appreciate it if no one made comments like that to her. You know she rarely fusses, so if she says something bothers her, we want to try to take it seriously, and appreciate your help.""

TIFU by not hiding my dildo well enough,"Two days ago I got my first dildo. Since I still live with my parents, I obviously had to hide the the sinful monstrosity. Where would be the best place to hide a sex toy? Perhaps up high in the corner of my closet. Nah, I'm short, horny, and lazy so I didn't want to climb up there everytime I wanted to get off. 

Well, under my bed the boxspring has a hole in it, perfect for objects such as a dildo. The hiding spot is set up so that when you look under the bed, you can't see the hiding spot, just the empty space underneath. 

I decide to hide my dildo, as well as a several other items of contraband (condoms and an anal plug), balanced on a piece of plywood in the boxspring. Perfect place for it, why would anyone be searching under there anyways.


After I get off work, I'm greeted with a text from my mom that says, ""We need to talk.""



Oh fuck, she found my dildo didn't she.


Turns out, while I was away at work, my mom was searching for a pair of her shoes (that I did not have) in my bedroom. I'm assuming the bed got bumped causing the dildo to fall off the piece of plywood onto the ground, but the point is she found my veiny purple dildo. 

For context, my family's religious and I don't seem like the type that would have a dildo. 


Here's a couple highlights of the conversation:


Her - I found a purple dick under your bed.


Me - Oh really? Hahahahaha


Her - I haven't had sex in [a long time] and even I've never bought one of those.


Me - Oh, well if you want I could buy one for you.
[I'm aware this wasn't the best thing to say, but I seem to lose any filter I have when I'm nervous]


At least she chuckled at that, maybe because of shock. But it made the situation slightly more bearable. 


Her - Why do you have one anyways?


Me - Well it's just my curiosity, hormones, and I felt bad for wasting so many cucumbers.
[Again, another stupid thing to say but I don't think she heard. Or she ignored me]


Then she brought up the condoms, guess a couple fell down with the toy, and asked if I was sexually active. I assured her I'm not, and that I got them because they were cheap and so that I could use it on the dildo when I didn't feel like washing it. Truth is, I got them because they were colorful (pink, yellow, and green) and I thought it would be funny to whip those bad boys out if I ever do have sex. But I felt like I had embarrassed myself enough already.

She was more disappointed in me than angry. I think we both shared feelings of shame and embarrassment, but she reacted differently than I thought she would. I have no idea how I'm going to look her in the eyes tomorrow.


At least she didn't find my butt plug. 



TL;DR - Bought my first sex toy a couple days ago. Found a good hiding spot for it, turns out it wasn't good enough and my mom found it. Don't know how I'm gonna look her in the eyes tomorrow knowing what she knows about me. Also relocated my toy to the upper shelf of the closet. Hid the other stuff in other places of my room. Don't wanna keep all my eggs in one basket. 


EDIT: I am 18 and female. I bought my dildo and butt plug at the same time, I refer to my dildo as my ""first"" sex toy because I used it first. Hope that clarifies some things :)

Blind furry sexually harassing me at work. [FL],"I'm 18 and I work part time at a Starbucks in Florida (along with another serving job). I'm a girl and I just finished losing a considerable amount of weight, and I'm receiving attention for the first time in my life and I'm still not really used to dealing with it. I do know that the way I'm being treated now is very screwed up, but I'm not sure how to handle it.

There's a man who started coming in every day, who I've interacted every shift of mine for the last month. He is at least in his mid-twenties and comes in wearing a tail and making furry jokes very often. He is somehow visually impaired and he brings in his service animal to guide him, and he makes sexually charged and inappropriate jokes EVERY time I've interacted with him, regardless of whether I'm make his drink/taking orders/giving drinks. If I'm not at the counter he yells inappropriately. The worst example I can think is him ordering a ""puppachino"" that we offer and letting his dog start to lick it and then holding it back to me. ""For the two favorite b****es in my life"" with a giant smile on his face before licking the top himself. It's usually not nearly that bad but it's pretty similar. He has pulled up inappropriate drawings on his phone and asked if I like doggy style. That specific puppachino incident was two days ago and his behavior continues to get worse. He does not seem to be severely mentally ill with anything and I think he's very aware of how uncomfortable he makes me. 

My manager generally isn't someone who is easy to get along with, and when I approached him with this he essentially handwaved away my complaints and told me that he couldn't do anything and that dealing with this was part of the job. He also explained that he knew about this specific guy because one of my other coworkers already spoke to him on MY behalf without me asking (so I know it's not just me!) but he can't do much because the guy is disabled? I know that that's ridiculous, but I'm not sure where I go with it. It's not like I can really argue back. 

Can anyone help me out with what to do? I currently live alone and I need this job but this one guy has turned what is otherwise a really fun and nice place to work into a place that makes me sick. Thanks. ",legaladvice

TIFU By not filling out a $2K questionnaire.,"This happened last month, but I realized what happened today. 

So, every year at my job we have open enrollment for insurance. During this process we get a questionnaire, a ""health assessment"". It has  questions like how many vegetables you eat a day, how many days a week you exercise, if you smoke, stuff like that. All you have to do is fill it out to get a discount on your insurance premiums. 

This year, I got a couple emails from HR saying ""Open Enrollment Info"". I didn't think anything of it because I'm not changing my insurance plan this year. Then I get an email ""You missed out on your health assessment discount!"" I look back, and fuck me, all those emails I ignored were telling me to do the health assessment! 

Ok, no problem. My insurance will probably go up like $10 a week. Sucks, but I can deal with it. 

I got my paycheck on Friday and it was a whopping $50 less than normal! I looked into it today, my insurance went up $40 a week!! (Plus other taxes going up.) $40 * 52 weeks is $2080 I lost this year because I didn't tell my insurance company how many vegetables I eat a day!!

I mentioned at work that I couldn't do any shifts after 4:00 on Saturday because I had a show. My coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

I had no problem helping him out and I knew this club wouldn't care if I slid a couple people in. But I've been trying to get more bookings at this place and it's kind of a level up from the sort of places I usually get to perform at so I told them, you know, ""please make a point to laugh.""

I'm up there doing my show and I see them and they're the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren't laughing. It bugs me a little but I didn't want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them.

So I start telling a joke about a time I gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as I'm doing it I'm slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes I'm talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn't notice or look up until I'm literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

It killed, so that was the good part. But when I showed up to work I was expecting an apology from him. Instead HE was expecting an apology from me for (I'm quoting here) ""inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke"" ""making him look like a fool in front of his girl"" and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

He basically summarized it as ""you're supposed to be a professional and if you couldn't handle me texting you shouldn't be in show business.""

HUGE. we found a 10 hour screening that showed the first 4 movies back to back. naturally, we decided to go. the theatre was mostly empty, except for this one couple and their kid a few rows down. this kid would not stop crying for a goddamn second. i ignored them for the first hour, then made some annoyed coughs that they heard, but ignored, and finally, i went up to them and asked them if they could either calm the kid down, or leave with him. they were rather rude about it, saying they were entitled to the theatre as well, and that we should deal with it. 

they were probably accustomed to the sound of a child crying, and seemed to be having a good time, but i was miserable, unable to enjoy the movies. so, i started bawling loudly as well, right until one of them shot a dirty glance at me, took the kid, and left. 

on the way out, the wife told me that they'd been looking forward to this break from parenting for a long time, and that I'd ruined their day. girlfriend thinks i'm TA. i think, leave your kid at home with a sitter if you can't get them to shut up. AITA?

Edit: Kid was an infant, probably like a year old.

Edit 2: Everyone's bringing this up; theatre staff talked to the parents themselves when the movie began, but were reassured that it wouldn't be an issue. the parents simply waved them off, and they stopped bothering after, so i didn't see much sense in calling the usher again.

AITA for taking away my niece's flower girl duty the day of the wedding?,"Got married last weekend and had a lovely day, but had some commotion early on the wedding day. 

For flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision. Unfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. 

During the wedding prep Katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself.

On the wedding morning I got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. Amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie. Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. 

My husband and I are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch with my brother before we leave. He finally called me and was extremely angry at me for taking the job away from his daughter. He said Amber has been crying the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to the job. 

As someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right thing to do after Amber's behaviour towards Katie. I can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point Katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than Amber.",AmItheAsshole

[UPDATE] Cat sitter stole our cats: PETAL AND JAMES ARE BACK HOME!,"[Link to previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4sfn3g/help_our_cat_sitter_is_refusing_to_give_us_our/)

Thank you so much to everyone who commented and PMd me on the last thread. You have no idea how much your support meant to me and how much it lifted my spirits. 

I'm so pleased to be able to update you that **Petal and James are safely back home with us!!**

We followed everyone's advice and called up the shelter she works at and advised them of the whole situation. We told them about how her credentials as a rescuer/foster carer were originally what made us feel comfortable about using her services, that she had taken the cats and was alleging abuse, that she had failed to take Petal's eyedrops, our concerns re animal hoarding etc. and we advised them that we would be pursuing her with the police and a private lawyer.

I say ""we"", but it was really my amazing husband who made the call while I was stuck at work.

That same day, I had an awkward moment where both myself and her mother were alone together in our office kitchen so I decided to just be really forthright with her and said, ""I think you should know that [husband] and I have contacted the shelter [daughter] works for, and we've also filed theft reports with the police and have taken on a lawyer. We're also notifying animal control about the number of pets she has. It's not too late for her to stop this."" (we actually hadn't gone to the station or called a lawyer yet, but I thought it might sound more serious). 

I don't know if it was her mom or the shelter that called her and told her to do the right thing, but my son called me at work just two hours later telling me that the daughter's boyfriend had just dropped Petal and James back home. My son said the boyfriend didn't say much and he didn't seem to know much about the drama, he just left the cats in my son's care and left.

I left work immediately and came home to my babies (oh, and my son lol). 

Both were well and safe, and we saw the vet that evening and had some tests done that we're still awaiting the results for - but all in all they seem fine. Petal's eyes were fine, and the vet said its possible she had access to the drops through the shelter, so that's a small mercy.

We still haven't decided if we're going to take it further legally. We have reported her to animal control regarding her pet numbers, but her instagram and facebook have gone into privacy lockdown so I don't know if she's still keeping the hero/victim narrative going or if there have been any consequences with the shelter. 

Again, thank you so much to everyone and I hope you can all rest a little easily (like I can) knowing that James and Petal are where they belong back home with us. ",legaladvice
"My vet misdiagnosed my cat and now she's about to die and is suffering, is there anything I can do? [MA]","My cat was severely misdiagnosed after I spent thousands at their primary vet. They said her labs were fine, her physical was fine, and I could send her home even though she wasn't eating, pooping, was lethargic, and wheezing and her eyes were barely open, ect. She was declining. They gave me eye drops only and sent me home. The next 2 days she could barely walk. Didn't eat or drink a thing, and didn't go pee or poop, I called out of work and brought her to the vet ER after confirming with the primary that her blood work was ""perfect"" 
I brought her to the ER and she had tumors deep on her legs that they couldn't believe the primary couldn't find, under her legs, her eyes have lesions, she has cancer, to the point where it's causing weakness throughout her body, and end stage kidney failure where she has clots in her kidneys so she can't even pee. The ER said it's unheard of that they couldn't find any of this in a physical exam or any of the lab work because the lab work alone should have found the elevated neutrophils, WBC, RBC, and her kidney failure, which would have prompted us for further testing. I am obviously emotional and haven't spoken to her primary. My cat is only 14. I know that is a good life length for a cat but I had gone to her primary THREE times for testing for X-rays, ultra sounds, and medications in regards to her wheezing and such and the ER said there is no way that they could have missed this as it couldn't have popped up overnight. Do I have a leg to stand on, I spent $3,472.23 I know that's a lot for an animal but I really wanted to try and she seemed like she was suffering but I was told that she was ""perfectly fine"" and her labs were unremarkable. The only other place in the area was the ER so that's why I went there.",legaladvice

I thought it was going to go right past him like when I say he's getting too big for me to carry. Instead, he looked at me from his bed, tears welling up in his eyes, and said in a quiet little voice, ""Daddy, that's so sad.""

TIFU by swallowing my little sister's birthday present,"I am so beside myself with shame that I almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

But reddit karma is my mistress and I must heed her sweet call. 

So yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), I was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""Look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

Now, I cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. I looked at that ring in my hand and I just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. My primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

So I did it.

I think it was the next split second when I saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that I realized what a horrible mistake I had made. 

So my little sister runs screaming from my room and I hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as I admitted that I, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. No, I didn't know why I did it. Yes, I am an idiot. No one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

So brief intermission from my sister's birthday as I make a quick excursion to the ER, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them I was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. They took a couple X-rays and I hung around the ER for about 8 hours before they broke the news that I was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

I shat out the ring this morning. 

Happy birthday sis. 

TL;DR: I am an idiot and I ate my sister's ring because I thought it would be funny. 

EDIT: good fucking god my inbox. Tune in tomorrow morning and I'll share a picture of the accursed ring

tifu by giving my boyfriend a blowjob [NSFW],"This is obviously nsfw.

And it didn't happen today, I was waiting until the weekend to post. 

So I don't mind the taste of cum, but its not exactly my favorite flavor either. I'm not entirely sure where I got he idea from, but years ago I know I had heard or read somewhere that if you deep throat when they are about to cum that it goes straight down your throat and you don't taste it. The other day while sucking my boyfriend's dick, I figured I'd try it.

But instead of going straight down my throat, somehow it ending up coming out of my nose. I had my boyfriend tied up and blindfolded, so he didn't see what was going on, and I (being the idiot I am) plugged my nose instead of letting it drip out of my nose. It stung so bad and my nose ran for hours. All day I felt like I had jizz dripping out of my nostrils. ",tifu
AITA for being upset my younger sister announced her pregnancy first?,"I know the title makes me sound like an asshole but please here me out.

I've been married for 12 years and we started trying for kids 2 years in. In the ten years that we've been trying I've had six miscarriages, two stillbirths, and two failed surrogacies. Naturally, my husband and I have been pretty devastated by all of this but try to move through it. My younger sister got married six years ago and now has three kids with no troubles. I try not to be jealous, and I genuinely love her kids and her, but I'm human and every time she announced a baby my heart broke a little more. We can't foster or adopt, my husband has a felony charge from when he was 18. He was stupid but he turned his life around and is a law-abiding citizen now.

We had stopped trying for a while but decided to try one more time this year. It took and I'm now five months along. We didn't tell anyone for fear of losing it but our doctors and ourselves are incredibly confident that this will be the winning pregnancy. The one person we did tell was my mom. She was planning my dad's 70th birthday bash and she asked if I wanted to use the party to announce it, since it would make my dad, who adores his grandkids, incredibly happy. I agreed.

The day of the party I'm hiding my belly when my sister and her family come in, and I can just tell looking at her that she's pregnant again. I take her aside and tell her in secrecy that I'm also pregnant. She was happy for me, we danced around, I may have peed a little. I told her we couldn't wait to tell everyone.

Couple hour later the party is in full swing, my husband and I find my mom and we go to find dad so we can make the announcement. My sister runs up to my dad and delightfully announces that she's eight weeks along with her fourth child. My dad was so happy, he adores kids and babies. When the excitement died down a little he came up to me, mom, and my husband said, ""another niece or nephew for you, Jess, isn't that nice?"" I said, ""yeah it is, especially now that MY baby will have someone to play with."" My dad was happy but, and please forgive me, not as happy as he would have been had I been able to make a big announcement.

When my sister announced I felt crushed. I know I'm nothing special and in the grand scheme of things, who really cares about another pregnant person. But I've got two babies in the cemetery and several miscarriages that lead up to this, and damn it, I just wanted one moment to celebrate. My sister has had three previous moments, I just wanted one. This will probably be the only baby I have. I took my sister aside and explained to her how hurtful it was to have her announce her baby when I've never got to do it before. Basically she told me to get over it and that the world doesn't revolve around me. I told her to fuck off and we haven't spoken in the week since. I know this is a trivial matter.

[SC] RA keeps interrupting sex because I'm gay (update),"Hello again legal advice. This is a follow up to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9bfpx8/sc_ra_keeps_interrupting_sex_because_im_gay/

I've got good news: the RA has been removed! I went to the residence coordinator and he called someone above him in the housing department, who told us to write down every incident I remember for housing to review, then go to the title 9 coordinator. It took awhile to get through all the paperwork, but the process was a lot less intimidating than I thought it would be.

The RA was fired and given the option of either moving to an empty room in one of the old dorms or moving off campus within 30 days. He chose to move out and stay with his girlfriend after a week, which I didn't realize he had since I've seen other women come into his room but I don't feel like stirring that pot. After I made the report, he stopped banging on the door when my bf was over, but every time he saw me I could feel him staring daggers into me. He also started doing petty stuff like ""accidentally"" knocking my towel onto the floor of the shower room and leaving it there. He left me an apology letter at one point, but it was definitely not sincere. I could've moved to another dorm temporarily but decided it would be too much work because they gave him a 30 day deadline and he started packing the Tuesday after.

Yesterday the new RA finished moving in, and after talking to him about all that happened I think we're going to get along fine! :)

The residence coordinator said that housing had done all they could do, any further action would be done as a result of the title 9 complaint, which might take several months to complete. And for those wondering, yes it is a public college and there is no no-sex policy (I looked through the housing contract and couldn't find anything except rules against sexual assault and discrimination based on sexual orientation), I should've said that in the original post but it blew up and was locked by the time I saw those comments.

[MI/NC] Bartender took my (real) ID and passport and won't give them back!,"I'm a NC resident attending a MI 4 year college. I just turned 21 about a month ago, and I went to a dive bar/music venue to drink and watch a show. I look incredibly young in person, but my ID is up-to-date and so is my passport as well. The bartender confiscated my ID last night because it looked fake because: ""it is out-of-state and your hair doesnt match."" My hair is currently dark purple, but in my license picture it's black, it looks almost exactly the same in a dimly lit bar anyway! So I tell the bartender I have a passport and he is confiscating my real ID and he says he will believe me when I bring my passport. 

I retrieve my passport, which clearly shows my age, and this time I ask to speak to the manager. The manager REFUSES to give my ID back, saying he's going to call the police to confiscate it, AND THEN HE TAKES MY PASSPORT. No, I'm not kidding, I wish I was. He went on a rant about how I tried so hard to act ""of age"" and had all this fake proof and a fake life. By this point the venue is almost empty and the bouncers kick us out. I now have 0 forms of identification on me. 

What can I do here? I'm supposed to drive back home in 10 days for a wedding, and I'm worried that he did call the police, they told him it was real, and he threw them away or something. Please help! ",legaladvice

I am not allowed to post in relationships (mods told me I am not allowed to post an update thread there) so I got the advice from someone to post the update here instead. This is the post I posted about 2 hours ago on relationship. Will try my best to update it as time goes.

Here is my previous post for the people who did not read:

[CLICK HERE to see my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wod49/i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during_her_30f/)

I will try to be as detailed as possible. I have had quite a few PM's regarding what happened and I got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. I want to let you all know that the support I have received has been incredible (both in PM and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

I am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the PM's, theres just too many to respond to but I would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

I would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, I tried to respond but I noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but I still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. Much love to you all.

I basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. I cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that I found out BEFORE i got married, with no children or attachments. I still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, I guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, I honestly dont know and dont care.

When I was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after I left reddit, she had woken up. She noticed the drinks out and asked me what I had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. I followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, I didnt want to give her any hint of what I knew. She asked my why I had been drinking and why I didnt come to sleep last night and I told her I was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. I felt detached, like I was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

She asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". She got herself done and left for work.

I basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. I planned on leaving things like furniture, TV and other things I really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. I just took the stuff most important to me so that I dont have to return here again. I dont care if she gets the rest. All in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

I called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and I really dont care at this point.

I also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

Around 1 pm I called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. I didnt leave any note or pictures at home, I just left. I am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

Around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 I start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

The only person I called back was my dad and mom. I have a huge trust for my parents, I basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. I told them its ended, and that I wont be getting married no more. I also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what I told them, I trust them alot so I am sure they wont say anything. I didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that I found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

Around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. I just told my dad not to intervene and that I need some alone time now.

I basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. Been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

I dont know if I should respond to them now or wait some more? Her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). I am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

Once again, thank you to everyone who replied. I will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, I know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. I hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

Time here is 10 pm soon.

TL;DR Found out my fiance cheated and I left without saying anything. Not 100&#37; sure what to say or to at this point...

EDIT 1:  since i still gett messages asking what happened i will leave this edit here. yes i did send the with proof to her sister (the part where the sister is talking about it) to her sister. i have since not received any call or message from the sister. my phone is still blowing up with calls and messages from the ex-fiance. havent read them though, yet. thinking of answering or something but i dont know what to say or do. might make another post later today so i can update you with what happened.

EDIT 2: Thanks once more for all support, sorry i havent updated, alot of things have happened and im too exhausted to write it all out today. I will head to sleep and try to update tomorrow morning with a new post. once again thanks for all support and all comments and feedback, i never believed i could have a community help me in such a big way. I might go for a vacation or something, dont know yet... i will just shortly explain that i really feel like neo in the matrix dodging bullets in slomo, however instead of dodging bullets i have dodged a slut wife, unwanted children with this wife, endless of fights and ton of depression. I honestly feel alot better knowing my life will get better. 
Shortly said about her, she has broken down and is begging me to take her back, so is her sister and friends. they also come up with the most retarded excuse of what actually happened (i dont believe them for 2 seconds) and much more... will let you all know tomorrow, going to crash now im mentally exhausted.",relationship_advice

I (22F) woke up in the middle of the night to find my best friend (22F) sleeping with my boyfriend (24M) in the living room,"Throw away account for obvious reasons, and sorry for any formatting, I'm on a mobile.  

I don't even know where to begin, my head is such a mess right now.. So my boyfriend ""john"" and I have been dating for three years and at the beggining, it was the most romantic love story. I met him when I was 18 and starting dweating him when I was 19 and qt more I dated him, the more I saw a future with him. 

He would always put time and effort into me, take care of me and go an extra mile to put a smile on my face. But things have changed since then to say the least, after about 1.5 years of dating. It started with little things, like him not wanting to kiss me as much or finding excuses to not hang out. We went from seeing each other every day to only hanging out maybe once or twice a week for two hours. I know he's got his own life and I'm not trying to control him, but I wish he would make me feel a little more special and maybe make an extra effort to see me. 

I should probably also mention that I suffer from depression and a low self esteem, and it's probably really hard on John when I'm in a bad state. I try not to but sometimes I just can't help feeling so alone and in the dark. 

So anyways, we were celebrating my bestfriend's  (ex-bestfriend now?) birthday at my house last night with a bunch of friends (maybe about 20) and there was a fair bit of drinking. The reason she couldn't have the party at her house was because she shares her place with room mates, which was fine because I had no problem throwing her party at mine, as long as she helped clean the house up in the morning. 

The night went alright, but I did I notice John and ""Sarah"" (the best friend) we're getting a little too close like him grabbing her from behind and spinning her around. But I just brushed it off because I never noticed anything before and we are all bestfriends. 

So after around midnight, everyone has left and John, Sarah and I are just chilling in the longueroom laughing about our night together. And when it was ready for bed, I set up a mattress in the longueroom for Sarah and John told me he'd be in our bed soon. So I went to bed and crashed alone. And maybe after a few hours I woke up in the middle of the night desperately needing to pee. Now I don't have a bathroom connected to my room, it's down the hall. So I slowly get up and realise John isn't in our bed?? So I went to walk down the hall when I start to hear like moaning noises and I'm like wtf and I peek my head down the hall to see John and Sarah having sex. I know I should of confronted them right there and then but I couldn't, I just sneaked back into bed and cried silently. I didn't even have a chance to pee. 

So now it's morning, Johns snuck back into our bed and is acting like nothing's happened. I've lost a long life bestfriend and a boyfriend I put three YEARS into you. I don't even know how to confront them, I'm not even sure if I can confirm what I had seen because we were all drinking, it's driving my insanity crazy. But the real kicker is that John and I haven't slept together in months, but he can sleep with her. I just feel so low. 

How can I comfort them and even begin to process this? I don't want to lose John, we have our ups and downs but he's everything to me :((( if everyone has ever been in this situation and has any advice, feel free to let me know, just don't be too brutal. I think I already know what I have to do..






EDIT 1: I used the excuse that I had to text my mother ""what day were hanging out today"" (I don't have credit and John knows that, so he didn't suspect anything) and I went through his phone and the evidence was pretty damming, they've been sleeping together for a while.. I took screenshots of their conversations and sent it to my phone in case he tried to deny it.

After all that, I confronted him when Sarah left, it was so hard to even get the words out. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, HE DENIED IT!! He told me that he loves me more than anything and would never do that, and that I should know that and to stop accusing him of such silly non-sense. That's when I told him I've seen all of his and Sarah's messages.. At first he still kept denying it saying ""someone's hacked his accounts"" and he doesn't know what I'm talking about, but eventually he broke down crying saying he loves me and doesn't wanna lose me, but couldn't feel the spark anymore and it was the biggest mistake of his life. He wants to make this work and push past this.. Well maybe you should of tried instead of sleeping with my best friend? 

So I told him to leave, and of course he doesn't ""know"" where his car keys are and asks if it's okay to stay for a few hours when his best friend Mark gets off work so he can pick him up. It was so difficult to say no but I did, I just wanted to be alone. I don't even know who he is anymore! He ended up ""finding"" his car keys and he's been calling and messaging me ever since.

As for Sarah, I got a message from her saying this (I'm assuming John gave HER the heads up): ""I can't even explain how sorry I am [my name], I never wanted to hurt you and I don't know how this happened, but something grew between ""John"" and I and I can't deny that what we have is so intensely strong and real. I hope we can work for this and I hope you can someday come to become okay with me and ""John"" being a couple. I wish you the best of luck and when your ready, please message me. Lots of love x""
SO I DONT KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE! John is telling me he wants to work through this while Sarah is saying their a couple. I'm now going to be ending it with John and my mum is gonna come meet with me and stay for a few days to make sure I'm Okay. 

Thanks for all the advice reddit :(

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EDIT 2: First of all I would like to thank everyone for yours words of advice and support, I really appreciate in a time like this. 

Some of you guys suggested that I send the messages that John sent me to Sarah. Me and my mum talked about it and how I might come off as spiteful and jealous, but I thought screw it. I don't owe you guys the time of day or respect, so I sent them to her. At first she didn't respond and ignored it, but then replied asking to meet up and discuss this. Shes now playing the victim saying she had no idea that John still wanted to pursue me and that we've both been played. Pftttt 

I have no idea if Sarah messaged John or what came of those messages. I honestly want nothing to do with them anymore. My plan is to pack up all johns shit and leave it out the front outside, then message him he can collect it WHILE I'm at work. He's got three days to get it until I donate it to a charity. I also then blocked his number and every social media account, so he can no longer contact me. I've also removed his name from any shared responsibilities/accounts we have together and any mail of his that is sent to my address, will be returned to sender because I'm not putting up with any more of his shit. 

As for Sarah, I have no intention of keeping that snake as a bestfriend. But unfortunately we travel in the same friend group, so I'll just have to avoid any future gatherings that she's participating in. Luckily I have friends that love me and will help me move through this.

Thank you again for your support!

Mum said that he tried to walk through the door and she told him to get lost and slammed the door in his face. I could hear him calling my name and it made me cry a little harder but I just wish if I could of have the scarification of watching him have the door slammed in his face!

"AITA for telling an infertile woman that ""fur babies don't count""?","Alt account. Ya boy done gone made a massive whoopsie. 

Basically I [20M] recently started a job where I have mostly female coworkers. Amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. They go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. There is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. She refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so I assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. However, Friday I asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. Quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which I get bc I love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. When she later complained again about not being invited to something I kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, I don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". Coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

Turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. Obviously I feel *awful* now, I didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. Still I'm saved a little by the fact that I didn't know, right?

Amy Schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail [see below],"EDIT: Thanks for the awards. I hope this post can raise some awareness.

In a [speech Schumer gave](https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  Ms. Foundation for Women's Gloria Awards and Gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""And then came the sex, and I use that word very loosely. His penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". Sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

Amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. In this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UrhXqRq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), Amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. The host says ""so you raped a guy"" at [11:12](https://youtu.be/8UrhXqRq2_4?t=670) and Amy replies ""yeah I know. When I tell this story I say I let a cab driver finger me but really I took his hand...\[sic\]"". If the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this TWICE, he'd be in jail after public outrage. Why the double standards.

Someone stole my CEO's identity and asked me to buy gift cards for the office. I fell for a scam hard how do I fix this?,"Hello,

Essentially someone stole my current company CEO's identity and emailed me to ask to do a favor from him. We are a small office so this did not seem out of the ordinary. They asked me to buy google play gift cards for a bonus and send them the details. I was out sick and my CEO's off sight a lot so I had no way of knowing it was not him. He also said he was in a conference call and could not call at the moment. So I purchased the cards and sent the scammer the details of the cards.  It was not until the scammer asked for a second batch that I realized that it might not be him. I called the office verified that it was not him. I immediately went to the police and filed a report.  Following this I contacted google and they canceled all nonactivated cards. They said they could do nothing about the activated cards. My company also called the credit card company and marked the purchases as fraudulent as they were made on the company card that they issued to me.  In total, I am potentially out 4700$ dollars.

The worst thing is that I was sick with a fever and had been dealing with family issues so I was preoccupied and why it did not stand out more as a fraud. Anyway, what is the best way to go about recovering the money? Also, am I in danger of any legal jeopardy?

TIFU by getting Reddit banned in Russia,"Today Reddit was blocked in Russia, and I am the one who posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%8B/) which lead to this.

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

A lot less people would go on mission trips if they couldn't take Instagram photos with the poor children,"I mean I'm sorry, but let's be fucking real here. Every single person I know who goes on one of these trips blasts their social media with squad pics with little African kids whose names they'll forget within the week. I doubt that many of these people would go solely for noble endeavors if they couldn't take any pictures because it is truly some weird social incentive. I respect that they are helping, but cut the pompous flexing on everyone trying to show how amazing you are. My friend just got back from building houses in Mexico, and he said he watched a girl  from another congregation pay some kids to take a picture with her. This world is fucking weird man.

Edit: Spelling and Grammar

Edit 2: This blew up, so I just wanted to clarify that I completely know that these trips happened before social media and I support anyone doing it out of the goodness of their heart. I just know from personal experience that a lot of these ""missions"" are virtue signaling vacations that aren't productive, or the money they cost to fund them could be allocated a lot more appropriately.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend to ""get over it"", it being how my daughter refers to him?","There's a few people to keep track of so I'm hoping this makes it easier:

* Me
* Katie- my daughter
* Ben - my ex husband and Katie's biological father
* Percy - my partner of 6 years
* Lisa - Ben's wife
* Chris - the mother of one of Katie's new friends.

Katie is 13. Ben and I divorced when she was 4, and we have 50/50 custody, so she stays with him every other week. They have a pretty good relationship. Katie refers to Lisa, Ben's new wife, as ""Lisa"", not mum or stepmum or anything like that.

I met Percy when Katie was 7. He moved in a few years ago, when Katie was 10, and he tries with Katie, but she's not nearly as close with him as she is with Ben, the same way she's not as close with Lisa as she is with me.

&#x200B;

Anyway, Percy was picking Katie up from a friend's house. Chris had never met Percy before, but had met Ben, so when Percy came to knock and get Katie, Chris asked who he was. Percy said he was Katie's father, Chris says ""no you're not"". Katie heard the exchange, comes to the door, and says ""oh, that's my mum's boyfriend"". Chris apologised for the misunderstanding.

Percy brought Katie home, and I saw them arguing as they approached the house, but couldn't hear what they were saying. They get in, and Katie immediately goes to her room.

Me: What happened?

Percy: We had a fight.

Me: I can see that. What happened?

Percy: \[recaps what happened with Chris\]

Me: And then what?

Percy: I drove her home, we talked and now she's mad at me.

Me: What did you talk about?

Percy: I just said that to stop stuff like this happening again she should tell people in advance that she has 2 dads. She said she doesn't have 2 dads. She's got him and me, I've looked after her, I've been there for her for 5 years.

Me: You know she loves you, but she's so close with Ben it's probably just weird for her.

Percy: I've been in her life as much as she has, I'm her dad too as far as I'm concerned.

Me: But you might not be as far as Katie is concerned. Lisa has been with Ben since we split up, she still calls her Lisa. I get why you're upset, but this should not be such a big deal.

Percy: Ben left you! Both of you! I'm the one that stuck around!

Me: Ben is Katie's dad, you are my boyfriend. She will call you both what she likes. Get over it.

Percy left. He texted to say he'll be back later but I feel insanely shitty. I told Katie to call them both what she likes and not feel pressured, and I know that was the right thing to do, but I feel like I could have handled the actual argument a lot better than I did. AITA?

&#x200B;

(edited typo. didn't introduce them until a year in so it's 5 years, not 6)

&#x200B;

In terms of ""get over it"". I was worried that giving him validation, by saying something like ""give it time"" or ""she'll come around"" would give him false hope. Katie has said to me that she has a dad, and a mum, and she's not about to start calling Lisa ""mum"" any more than she's about to start calling Percy ""dad"". I felt in the moment that if I didn't communicate that this was Katie's choice and he had to decide if he could work with it, and instead gave him false hope that she'd change her mind, it would only make things worse because he would think there was a possibility she could change her mind.",AmItheAsshole

My husbands dentist LIED saying he had 13 cavities when MY dentist said his teeth are perfect!,"Thank you in advance for any advice or information given to help!

My husband (27m) had a different dentist from the one I (26f) had been using since I was a kid. There was a period of time he didn't go to the dentist for a couple of years. So about 4 years ago he went back to the same dentist he used to use, and his mother has always used. 
That dentist in NJ told my husband he had 13 cavities! So my husband listened and went back to start having them filled. He ""filled"" at least two then my husband stopped going again. 

Fast forward to now, I went to see my dentist on Tuesday and made appointment for my husband to go in today (Thursday).  MY dentist showed my husband his X-rays and told him his teeth are perfect! And that he actually had pre drill holes where this other dentist was going to fill fake cavities!! This is so wrong! My MIL also had thousands of dollars of work done to her mouth that could also have been unnecessary. She is making an appointment with my dentist to get another opinion on her mouth.

"Assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist","Basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
BUT:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc 
-> fixing the person's problems

If after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

A much needed edit:
- The time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" Programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way
- the free aspect seems to irritate some people who don't want to fund it with their tax, how about funding it with the taxes from rich people/corporations instead?

My girlfriend hates men more and more with each passing day and it's making me feel uncomfortable.,"We've been together almost two years. She's always been a feminist and I've always supported feminism, but her views have grown more aggressive and extreme in recent months.

She's been saying that she hates men, and that all men are creepy, and that straight people are boring - she's pansexual, I'm straight. She recently said that it's proof attraction and sexuality isn't a choice, because there's no way she would actively choose to be attracted to cis men.

Instead of making me feel special, it all just makes me feel sad. I've never been with someone who hates whole groups of people like that, besides very obvious and logical ones like white supremacists and rapists. It bothers me. I'd be the last person to try to defend the entire male gender - I'm not interested in taking sides in any kind of gender war. It's just the negativity and the bashing and the insults that are starting to get to me. Maybe it's illogical and weird in this day and age to be a straight man who feels a little hurt when their partner jokes that straight men are a blight upon society, but if that's the case, then I guess I'm just illogical.

Is there any way I can talk to my girlfriend about toning down the hateful language without making it sound as though I'm against feminism and defending misogynistic men?

AITA for refusing to give candy to parents who take their babies trick to treating?,"My college has an annual event where local kids can safely trick or treat in the dorms the day before Halloween. The students are required to buy their own candy and have to pray they don't run out before the event is over, which happened to me last year.

So tonight was this event and I was pretty strict with the ""one candy per kid"" rule, but I was really uncomfortable when a parent would approach the door with a baby (and I mean less than 1-2 years old) and expect me to give them candy on their behalf. This happened with parents who had other, more appropriately aged kids with them too, which was I guess more understandable. But mainly it happened with parents who had nobody else but the baby- they would just show up to my door holding a costumed baby and a bag and said ""say trick or treat!"" as if they deserve something for that.

After this happening more than a few times, I decided to put my foot down and deny candy to kids who weren't old enough (can't walk, can't hold their own bag, doesn't know what's going on). From that point on I said to everyone else that night: ""We have limited candy and want to make sure the 'big' kids get some.""

I wound up getting some criticism from a few parents, some made shocked or disgusted faces and one couple even said they wanted to complain to the resident manager of my building, who is 100% on my side on this.

Am I the asshole for thinking that it's wrong for parents to use their baby, who is too young to remember their first or second Halloween, to get free candy for themselves by trick or treating?

**EDIT: I'm definitely NOT against giving candy to teenagers. Hell, I've even seen a few of my fellow students trick or treating at this event!

When I was coming into puberty. I was jacking off a lot, but my house had a ""no locked doors"" policy and my family would walk in a lot for no reason. I came up with the idea of turning on the shower in the bathroom attached to my room; then would jack off in my bed. Family thought I was showering and would let me lock my door. There was a second room attached to my bathroom, which meant two doors in the bathroom(will be important later.)

Well one night, I start my routine. Turn the shower on; grabbed a handful of conditioner, return to bed to beat the meat. Well about 10 minutes into this particular sesh, I hear my father stomping up the stairs shouting my name. My heart starts racing.

 ""How the fuck does he know im jacking off?!?"" I think.

""I can't get in trouble for anything right now, he will think I can't hear him in the shower.""

I lay perfectly still like a T-rex is approaching. He begins banging on my door, shouting my name. I hear him run around back toward the guest room to try the other door to the bathroom. ""What the fuck is his problem?!"" I think. Not sure if the other door is locked. I jump out of bed so I can hop in the shower and get wet so he thinks I was actually showering. I open the door to the bathroom- and a small wall of water released into my bedroom. The entire bathroom had flooded. Some how a rag had fallen onto the shower drain, and flooded the whole bathroom. I opened the door to the guest room, buck ass naked with a huge boner on. (I have no idea why it didn't go down..) it was raining downstairs, dad was the angriest I had ever seen him.

I ended up having to spend the entire night mopping the water up with towels and throwing them in the drier. my dad had to replace a lot of the second floor. And my family ripped on me about that story for years after.

Tl;dr I ran the shower to hide my jacking off and accidentally flooded the second floor bathroom of my parents house.",tifu

When she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me I'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

I said ok, I just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" I dont need your help"", again super angry. 

I wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but I was the first one, cause I was sitting right by the restroom

Cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. Then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

She couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. So another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

The barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if I could help and I said "" I was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, I'm good"".

I kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

They all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

Husband (31M) refuses to let me (23F) have a day off from the kids,"Me and my husband have been married for 4 years and we have 2 kids together (3 yr old and a 7 month old). I've been a SAHM ever since we had our first kid and things have been going well for us. 

I moved away from home to be with him and I don't know anyone here. All of my outings have been with my husband. This weekend, a friend of mine is visiting and I told my husband I would love to have some time off so that I can meet up with her. He flat out said no and that he refuses to use his weekend to take care of the kids and the house. His reasoning is that he works hard all week and expects me to stay home or take the kids with me. Am I wrong to be upset over his reaction?

TIFU by having the FBI pull me out of class,"Obligatory *""this happened a few months ago.""*

This was easily the most stressful roller-coaster of an event that I hope I ever experience. 

The scene is freshman year of college. I'm a wide-eyed innocent student having a great time away from his parents. I've made some good friends and enjoy messing with them. As such, I decide to pull a little prank on them. It starts with a simple idea: I'm going to Ohio on a business trip. I was actually going to lunch with my parents, but this was a more fun story. I hadn't initially thought out this entire prank, but just like high school presentations, I decided to wing it. Every so often I would go on these out-of-state ""business"" trips, but I stayed vague as to what my business was. I told them that it was somewhat illegal, but in more of a gray area.

My friends were incredibly intrigued by my illicit endeavors, and as time went on, they began to ask more questions about this business. I still had little to no plan for this ordeal, but boy did I milk it. I had them convinced that there were overseas bank accounts with millions of dollars in them and that I had several people involved in this business. At one point I told them the story of how one of my employees got caught trespassing on government property and I had to pay $10,000 to bail him out. I would ""accidentally"" send a picture of several thousand dollars, claiming it was meant to go to someone else with no other explanation.

This went on for several months up until about April. The semester was coming to a close, and I had to figure out a finale for my little project. My roommates were in on my prank and several iterations of plans were discussed. The final version of this ~~bad idea~~ plan was as follows: I will create an email address posing as the chief of police at my college. In the email, the officer (we'll call him Bill Myers) will inform my friends that he is currently looking to bring in ShortTail359 for questioning. I was very specific to say that no one should call 911 or contact anybody outside of this email address with the excuse that there was no official investigation so Bill was looking into the matter himself. I then went on to explain how ShortTail359 is conducting a business out of university housing and that this is all we know but the business might be illegal/dangerous. In summation: email me if you know of ShortTail359's whereabouts, don't call 911, don't contact anyone else in the police department.

I figured I covered my bases and sent the email. It was very well worded and quite convincing to a group of people who already believed I was running a secret business. Sure enough, my friends bought it hook line and sinker. One of them replied, informing Bill that she didn't know anything about my business, other than that I mentioned it occasionally. Three friends ignored the email altogether, and one texted me saying she didn't believe it.

The next three days were interesting. I had several classes with these people and finals were upon us so skipping class was not a good idea, but I had to make them believe I was on the run. Fortunately some of these classes had several hundred students and I was able to sit far away from our usual spots. The smaller classes I avoided altogether. Meals were eaten at odd times, and at one point I had to hide in the shower because a friend was in my dorm. I had no contact with the prank-ees outside the occasional text.

Fast forward to the Thursday I decided would be the day to reveal my shenanigans. I'm walking into class when these two men in suits stop me just inside the door. They ask me if I am ShortTail359 and upon confirming this they tell me they need to speak with me outside. We walk downstairs to the building's lobby where I am greeted by two more men who have guns at their sides. All four of them hold up their badges in dramatic fashion and one introduces himself as ""Agent Michael Scarn with the FBI"" (fake name obviously). It was approximately at this point that I peed a little bit as I realized that I was in some trouble.

Agent Scarn: ""Do you know why we're here?""

ShortTail359: ""No, but I have a pretty good guess.""

Agent Scarn: ""Well why don't you tell us what your guess is?""

I proceeded to explain the email I sent out along with a brief summary of the genesis of my prank. 50 minutes of questioning later and I had given Agent Scarn the password to the email account, signed an agreement saying I won't access the account or I'd face several charges, given a written statement of the events, crapped my pants twice, and completely missed my class. Agent Scarn gave me his business card and said they would be in touch.

I go back to my dorm and try to come to terms with the fact that I may have ruined my future career and life altogether. All my friends had a good laugh at my expense but not before I had a good laugh at their expense for believing my stupid business story. After a long sleepless weekend I get a call from a Sergeant at the police station. He says that he needs to meet with me and we arrange a time. I go down to the station and for 10 minutes all he does is yell at me and tell me what a stupid idea this was. Now I'm a pretty good kid. Never got in trouble in school, honor roll, never so much as a speeding ticket, so having a police officer yell at me was a new experience. He finally calms down enough for me to explain that this is an anomale and that it was supposed to be an innocent prank. He believes me and tells me that regardless, they're going to charge me with criminal impersonation which is a class A misdemeanor. My court date is set for a couple weeks from now and that was the end of it.

I go to court fully prepared to leave with a no longer perfect record. As the staff is processing me and taking my mugshot, a lady asks me what my name is. I tell her ShortTail359, when a guy jumps around the corner and yells ""But you can just call him Chief Bill Myers!"" This was a much needed laugh and also informed me that word of my idiocy had gotten around town. I go into the court room and waited for this lighthearted judge to call my name. Most of the charges were speeding tickets or marijuana related so the judge was moving pretty quickly. However, he calls my name and then pauses. I walk up to the podium and he's still paused, clearly reading over my file. He looks up at me, and then back down at my file again. After reading it completely through, he just starts laughing. Several minutes go by before he finally asks me if I have any sort of criminal history. I tell him I don't have so much as a speeding ticket and he asks if I would like to keep it that way. I happily say yes and he give the DA my paperwork. The DA asks for my story and tells me that he's never seen anything like this before (something I had heard several times at this point). He informs me that this is something they could have expunged as long as I pay my court fees. I thank him and go back to waiting for the judge to call me up again.

When he does, a smile immediately dawns his face and he begins to chuckle. At this point I'm relieved enough to let out a giggle of my own since I can feel the entire court room wondering what I've done. The judge tells me that he will expunge my charge and asks me if I will ever do something like this again. I assure him that I will not and he says, with a smile on his face, ""You know son everyone in this court room is wondering who you impersonated, but I'm going to do something that you should have done and keep my mouth shut."" I thank him and sheepishly walk out of the room.

Later that day I took the required documents back to the court and had the whole charge expunged in a matter of hours. It was easily the most stressful month of my life and was not worth it at all, but I am now able to walk around with an FBI agent's card in my wallet and keep a fond memory of being laughed at by a judge.

TL;DR: I play a prank on my friends that ends with me being questioned by 4 FBI agents for almost an hour and charged with criminal impersonation.

AITA for calling the police on my kid?,"Daughter is 16. Her mom and I are divorced.Daughter has been caught smoking pot several times from the age of 14. Her mom and I have collectively punished her several times for this. The last time we caught her, I started drug testing her. Her mom doesn't agree with it, but we have caught her so many times now that I think this is the best way to prevent her from doing it.

I don't normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and I needed to reset it. When I go into her room, I found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. I look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. I go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously I am enraged, so I wait for her to get back from school, and I called the police. She was arrested, booked and released into her mother's custody.

Her mother is pissed, and saying that I may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated.

TIFU my first date.,"I'm a very socially awkward person.

So when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on Tinder resulted in a first date I was ecstatic. We had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; TV shows, movies, and what not. After my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, I decided ""fuck it"" and asked if she wanted to see Rogue One with me last Friday night. She said yes!

The night comes and I decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that I wear on a daily basis. Jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket I'd received from my mother on Christmas. It was raining too so I grabbed an umbrella on my way out.

I get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. I wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. Nervous, I walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. We shake hands, say hi to one another, and I ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. She says yes and off we go.

Here's where it went south.

We're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. I'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what I did, but I immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. Confused, she asks what I'm doing to which I reply, ""I got this.""  She quickly realizes what I'm about to do and starts saying ""Oh, you don't have t-"". 

I cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. The silence quickly makes me realize what I've done. I mutter out a ""After you..."" and she continues to stare at me.

Without a word, she ghosts me on the spot. I pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.

Cops should get fired if they get fat.,"If you can't run after a person with ease or karate chop a suspect to the ground without breaking a sweat (lol), you should be fired. Cops need to be extra fit because not only are they responsible for public safety, they also have to wear heavy utility belts, weapons, and vests which weigh them down. 

It's important for cops to be agile and nimble and able to run someone down, especially because I think fatter cops are more trigger happy (can't run after someone? Fuck it. Just shoot 'em). Only in America have I ever seen fat cops.

AITA for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?,"I am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. They're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

My sister Paula's daughter Amy is the most successful of the bunch. She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

I don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

When Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

Amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. I don't mind this but they do, but once again Paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

The final straw came last weekend. My son Mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. Paula, her husband Rob, and Amy were there, and Paula set about trying to convince me to let Amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. Mark's fiancee Vicky barely knows Amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. Paula said Amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

I was frustrated and told Paula that Amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. I told Paula Amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

Unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. Amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying I was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public.

My (25M) girlfriend (24F) of 2 years doesn't want to get rid of a bedbug infestation.,"We just signed a lease last month to start living together in a new place. Well, we had a housewarming party that got a bit bigger than we expected, with some friends of friends we didn't know showing up. More than 20 people in total. We suspect the bedbugs came from someone at the party. We've had them for more than a week now.

My girlfriend refuses to cooperate in getting rid of them. Because she doesn't believe it's okay to do so. I'd always known she was a very compassionate person and truly views all living things as precious and important, volunteers for a few humanitarian causes like animal shelters and loves nature. But I didn't know it went this far, that eradicating pests like this is wrong. This is very extreme to me.

Meanwhile, we are getting eaten alive every night and they just keep multiplying. I'm out of patience, I've asked her many times how she can stand living with this, she just says it's ""annoying"" but she couldn't bring herself to intentionally kill anything. Even a fucking bedbug.

Today I decided I was done with this bullshit. I called an exterminator and scheduled an appointment for tomorrow. When I told her, she flipped. I said I didn't care what she thought, she could help me pack up everything to prepare or not but it was happening. Then once I went to work, she cancelled it behind my back! She texted me to tell me. She said she doesn't want to fight with me, that we should be able to ""live in harmony with each other and other creatures""!!! She also said she's really stressed due to our disagreement about it, but I'm stressed from having the bedbugs!

Now I'm about to go home to our infested apartment and confront her. Please help. I feel like my life has turned into some realm of insanity. How do I make her understand that the pest control needs to happen??

TL;DR: My girlfriend sabotaged my efforts to exterminate bedbugs in our home because she strictly believes it's wrong to kill them. I don't know how to make her stop or compromise.

Edit: we're fucked. She got home today and said she got fired. She works at a daycare and they found bedbugs there today, then she straight up ADMITTED they were from her. Because she was trying to convince the other staff that there's ""natural"" ways to get them to leave! What ways? I've asked a million times and everything she says is bullshit. Some of it I sourced to quackery sites riddled with fake health information and conspiracy theories, some she claims ""someone told her"", the rest I honestly think she just made up. Anyway they let her go after she tried to argue with them. I am just blown away by her idiocy about all of this. There's no other term for it. So now I've lost a LOT of respect and trust for her. It sucks. I always admired how humanitarian she was but jesus this has taught me that everything needs to have limits. And that even good impulses can be crazy and harmful in effect.

That's not the only thing. I went and talked to the other tenants last night after reading some of these comments. Welp they've all been finding bedbugs too. The entire house is infested. As if my girlfriend losing her job isn't enough, I just got off the phone with the landlord. She got the complaints from the other tenants and knows we're the source of the infestation because we were the first to report it. I'd informed her I was having it taken care of after I scheduled the appointment my girlfriend ended up cancelling. So now, I had to tell her why it never happened. She was really pissed off and said she would have covered that single-time extermination assuming we were going to cooperate but now that my girlfriend fucked it up and the whole house is crawling with them, it'll be probably THOUSANDS in expenses. She told me she's going to be looking into holding us liable for the cost. I'm so absolutely fucked. I don't have thousands of dollars lying around. Neither does my girlfriend who's fault it is, and as of today nor does she even have a fucking job. I am so mad I don't even know how to deal with her. She's out right now and idk when she'll be back, she's avoiding me. 

I don't know what to do. I just need to move and get the hell out of here asap. I do not think I will be inviting her along with me. In fact, I don't think I can even stand being in a relationship with her after this. Unless she shows some serious sincere understanding of the shit she caused. But I know her values and way of thinking, and she's very stubborn. It's not going to happen. Goddamn even ruining our lives probably won't make her change.

Anyway. Gonna go build a time machine so I can have never moved in with her, there's basically no other way to fix this.

Edit 2: I commented a reply to someone that got a bit long, copying it here. (TL;DR I broke it off with her)

Honestly, yes she used to be pretty hot. Last few months she's been gaining weight and got fat now. That's just extra incentive to leave I decided. Realistically I don't think I could possibly not have this whole clusterfuck be the first thing on my mind whenever I'm around her. I'm so pissed off. I'm getting a consultation with an attorney first thing tomorrow to see if/how I can legally protect myself against landlord's lawsuit for damages so that it's her responsibility. I already told her I don't want to see her. I don't care if she goes back to the apartment, she can have it. I've left everything there except my electronics and some personal items. They can burn it all, I don't care. As of tonight I'm temporarily staying with a very generous friend (after thoroughly showering at the gym, of course) who I'm unspeakably grateful to. It'll be a pain to replace my clothes, and furniture once I find a new place, but I know where to get cheap shit that will do for now. I have some emergency savings. Guess this is exactly the kind of thing that's for. And fortunately I still have my job which is more than she can say.",relationship_advice

TIFU by accidentally activating the Emergency Lockdown alarm at my school on my second day as a student teacher,"This happened yesterday. For those of you who don't know, Pre-Student teaching comes just one semester before student teaching. Essentially, I have to observe in a classroom for 80 hours total. Beyond observation, I will eventually teach some lessons. This was on my second day of observation.

On my first day my coordinating teacher (CT) had me simply observe her class, telling me that she would ease me into the way she does things before letting me teach a few things to her classes. 

As I was only 5 minutes into my second day, I was still just observing, sitting at her desk. Now, this is important. She's having me sit at her official desk while she walks around the room and stands at an informal monitor setup. Yippee, I feel important (not really).

So while she explains to her class what they will be doing for the day, I just watch and fiddle around a little at her desk. I was absent-mindedly running my hands along the bottom of the drawer of her desk, and just passing the time. I felt something with one of my fingers and pressed it in, without thinking it was anything other than a latch or something for the drawer. Oh my fuck, was I wrong. Now, the second I felt the thing I touched actually compress, I knew I fucked up.

Cue the loudest fucking alarm you've ever heard in your life. Now this isn't a constant tone, but rather a constant message, stating the following: 

""EMERGENCY. EMERGENCY. PROCEED TO EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN. THERE IS A THREAT IN THE BUILDING. LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN ALERTED AND IS ON THE WAY""

I damn near shit my pants, the students all start freaking out, most assuming it was an impromptu drill, and my CT immediately runs to the door, locks it, and shuts the blinds. 

Instantly I try to motion to her that it was me, but she runs back to her computer. As it turns out, a school-wide email was also sent to each teacher, telling them exactly where the alarm was coming from. 

Go figure, my CT saw that it was coming from her own room. She then finally turned to me and saw the look of horror on my face. She then spent the next 5 minutes trying to alert the main office that it was, in fact, a false alarm. In the first few minutes of the 5, a police officer arrived to confirm that it was just some dumbass (me) who had set it off.

I spent the rest of the day completely red-faced whenever near any of the faculty and I was appropriately poked fun at by all of them. 

At least I came away with a story that my university professor says is ""one that I doubt will ever be topped"".

TL;DR I pressed a button under my desk that I didn't know existed, setting off a school-wide alarm used for active shooters.

Edit: Thanks for the gold! It's my first. Glad I could share a neat/funny story.

I've been curious about this for a while, but I've been unable to find any answers elsewhere. I appreciate any insights you kind folks can give me.

TIFU by letting my boyfriend have a lie in.,"Obligatory just over a week ago comment. So I have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we've only been together three months. And also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

Ragebeak belongs to me. It is a Saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. Still, I thought being a Saturday I'd take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

I fell down the stairs. Still holding very small parrot and my first thought was OH GOD DONT CRUSH HIM so I threw my hands up like I just didn't care and...

I broke my back.

And then when I finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) I passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

Woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like THE DEAD and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

TL;DR removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. Right in his face.

EDIT - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so I'm not paralyzed and there shouldn't be any life-ruining effects. I'm just on bed rest and LOTS of pain medication!

Thanks for the silver! And gold! AND THE POO! And all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)

AITA for playing loud annoying music specifically when my roommate was having sex?,"She and her boyfriend are really loud. If this was during a reasonable hour then I'd be better with it but this is literally midnight to 3am (not for all 3 hours but starts any time in this window). This keeps me awake when I have to work morning shifts and get to work for 5am most days, so I really need to be able to sleep through the night, which she knows, and even with earplugs they still managed to wake me.

I tried wearing earplugs, then headphones, neither worked, so I've asked them to keep it down more than once. Last night they were being exceptionally loud and when I asked them to keep it down, she insisted that I couldn't hear anything. I took out my phone and bluetooth speaker, put the speaker in a bookshelf that is up against our shared wall, and played whatever songs I could think of to ruin the mood.

The songs included, but were not limited to:

* *I Just Had Sex* and *Finest Girl* by Lonely Island
* *Bananaphone*
* *We Should Definitely Not Have Sex Right Now* from Crazy Ex Girlfriend
* *Always Look on the Bright Side of Life*

And a few others.

About half an hour went by and she leaves her room and pounds on my door telling me to keep it down. The walls are paper thin so she can hear the music the same way I can hear the moaning. Today at breakfast she said ""we'll keep it down from now on, you don't have to be such a dick about it.""

I thought we'd be able to laugh it off because they were jokey songs that I picked, clearly for a laugh, and I figured she'd see the funny side but then she said the thing about me not having to be a dick about it and now I feel like a dick.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: please stop suggesting I record audio of them going at it. It's weird, she's my friend, and it's just really a step too far.

INFO: They've been doing this for maybe 10 weeks, give or take? I've asked her to stop at least once, sometimes twice, per week since he started coming over, so roughly a dozen requests to keep it down over nearly 3 months.

Further info: no one else can hear us. There's no flat above us, no one in the flat below us, the side of us with the bedrooms side has no flat next to it and the nearest neighbours are on our other side with about 30ft and 4 walls between them and us.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for choosing my dogs over my 5year long relationship?,"Ive had my dogs since before we were together. We got together in HS and now decided to live together as we attend uni in the same state.

I chose to take my dogs with me because they were always MY dogs, i took care of them, fed them, trained them. Moreover, they ***feel*** mine. They love me more than anyone in my family, follow me even to the bathroom. They are super well behaved but also I have to admit they are very possessive of me, wanting to hug all the time (as in lay against me while they sleep) 2 of them are super small, one is medium sized, all mutts.

My bf wasnt excited to live with them but he wasnt against it either.

But now he is, 4 months into our living together he told me an ultimatum - either I send the dogs to my parents/shelter/new owner or he leaves. 

As arguments he presented that they have to sleep in our bedroom ( they do, but they don't sleep on the bed, they have their own small dog beds) so he cant focus while having sex, they are always near me, that they lick me and I kiss their foreheads - both of which he finds disgusting - and that out flat is too small anyway to have 3 dogs in it. When i said he had no problem before we moved in, he claimed he thought i will come to my senses already and ""besides, you wouldnt move in if I told you to leave your dogs and I love you too much to live away from you""

I was heartbroken but when he said he will leave if I dont get rid of the dogs, I packed my stuff and moved to my friend's flat. She was looking for a roommate anyway (thankfully) and accepted the dogs. 

I thought we were over, cried my heart out for a week and now after 2 weeks he called me and said he ""made a mistake"" but that he was hurt I loved dogs more than him. My whole family is on his side. Even my friend said I overreacted and that they would be mad too if ""i broke up with them over a dog"".

It has been about a month or so since I posted and I figured I would update you guys(since I love updates). Unfortunaly is not a good one...

My father asked for a divorce about a week after the post, it caught me out of guard and I was shocked. They talked before this but my dad came home even more upset than the day on the restaurant.

He asked me whether I'd like to live with him or my mom and I chose him. I love my mom to death but on the day-to-day basis I get along better with my father. I called her to explain but as soon as I said said she disconnected the call so yeah.... I wrote her a letter and tried to give when we went home to her our things but she ripped off, which was very painful to see. My dad and brother started screaming at her and I left with my SIL.

I went with my dad to have a consultation with my psychologist and they tried to help me see why she is doing this. From what I can understand, there might be some reasons

I went through a pretty tough period, I got depressed, anxious and had some problems with eating disorder but I've been in medication and therapy, which has helped a lot. After this I felt much happier and had energy to work on myself, I started working out with my brother, my SIL teached me how to use make up and my grandma gave me a bunch of gift cards to buy some new clothes. I've also started trying new hobbies and my days are really busy.

We think that my mom started feeling left out and jealous of me, especially since my brother/dad started paying more attention to me and I know they have actively making an effort to compliment me and pay attention to what I say/am interested in.

She thought that with the new baby she would be the grandma but she and my SIL don't get along that well(they don't fight but they don't have much in common either) and I guess she was feeling pretty sad.

After the post I started wondering whether my mom had been through some sort of abuse, which could explain her reaction to my dad seeing me naked and whatnot. It wasn't that.

My dad said he was a victim of sexual abuse and that it came from someone he trusted and was family, so my mom saying this made him enraged. He tried talking to her after but apparently she just kept implying it and he can't keep being married to someone who would say this.

There's more about it but that's basically what went wrong.

I'm honestly heartbroken, I can't wrap my head around what my mom did and I still feel guilty about this whole story(even more now, since it was bc of me that felt left out). I don't know what our relationship will be like, my dad has the full custody but said I could visit her anytime I want but we haven't talked yet and she hasn't tried to contact me.

My brother still talks to her but not as much, he says she is ok, he said she asks about me but I think he's lying. 

We are living with my grandma but will move to a new house next month, it seems like a cool place and is close to my brothers work.

On a happier note, SIL is almost ready for the baby and the name I suggested was the chosen one! I can't wait to meet my niece :D

Thanks for all your responses, they helped me so much.

Yesterday morning, I texted him with the reasons why I found his words to be so hurtful, thinking he'd my message and apologize. However, I should have known that he'd just ignore me.

He left me on read for the whole of yesterday and today. Finally, at night, he texts me to say that he's been really busy at work the past couple of days. Then he was like ""Can i be honest with you? I'm really not feeling this, so lets end it. Been on the fence about it for some time but after our fight I knew that this wasnt right."" 

Thats it. He already unfollowed me on Instagram and unfriended me on Facebook. I was venting to a friend (incidentally, his coworker) and she told me that he was kind of bummed out all day because he found out his ex got a new boyfriend. 


This honestly sucks. I actually felt like we had something. But I should have seen the red flags in hindsight, of which there were many. I get it though. Dude dated a beautiful fashion model for 5 years, how can he go back to being with a normal woman. But unless he knows any other models, I guess we mere mortals will have to do.

AITA for telling my wife to get over it?,"Bit of background:
I normally work from home, but I had to come into the office for a few days, because I am applying for a new position and I wanted to shake hands and do an interview in person. It is about a 3.5 hour drive to the main office building, so my wife, our 2 kids, and I all planned to stay at a relatives house during this time. The relative's house was empty(they were going to be on vacation during this time).

We drove over yesterday, but when we were about 45 min away from their house, they texted and said their vacation didn't happen because their flights were cancelled by a hurricane. They forgot to let us know until just then. My wife had no intention of staying there while they were there too, so we was very upset by this and pleaded with me to find a hotel instead. We had no money for that, so I said we couldn't do it. We sat there arguing for a long time, she was crying for most of it saying things like ""I don't want to go!"" and ""don't make me go!"".

My only option was to drive her back home, but that would have added 5 hours to my night and it was already late, so I told her she had to suck it up and stay there anyways.

She continued crying and punching the roof of the car, and eventually I snapped and yelled at her, saying things like ""Stop acting like a baby"" and ""Just suck it up and deal with it"".

Feeling bad about the whole thing this morning, just looking for a 3rd party perspective.

Edit: 
Wow, this blew up. Just to clarify, the reason she didn't want to go is because she doesn't want to deal with people and try and keep kids behaving by herself. Normally I work from home so I can help her, but in this situation she has no help and she feels overwhelmed. That is the reason she told me. I, like I said, think that's a crappy reason, and I kinda wanted her to suck it up.
There is of course more to the fight and more was said, but typing it all out seemed like a hassle. I just included the worse parts for context.

Today, she says that she is sorry and that she feels like she acted badly. Ironically, the relatives ended up changing plans again, so they are out of the house anyways.

My (42M) daughter (18F) hit my 9 year old son. Kicked her out and my wife thinks I'm overreacting.,"My 18 year old daughter (Chloe) is bipolar and is very difficult to live with. She throws fits over the tiniest of things and blames her depression on everything.  Got a D on a test blames it on depression. Didn't do her chores, blames it on depression. Leaves the house for 4 hours without warning, blames it on depression. Uses my car and leaves it on empty when she gives it to me, blames it on depression. Goes drinking, blames it on depression. 

Chloe has been going to therapy twice a week for the past 4 years and she's still hard to live with. She goes through episodes where she's really pleasant and lovely. We've taken her to a mental health facility 3 times now. Each time she comes home fine for about a month. Then before you know it she turns into Satan. It is impossible to predict. She takes medication for it but she's still all over the place.

We have been trying our best to deal with her but she makes it extremely hard. What set me off the edge was yesterday. 

My 9 year old son told me that Chloe took my grabbed my wallet on the counter and took all the cash I had in it. I confronted Chloe about it. I grounded her for 2 months and took her car keys away. Told her she'll get them back when she is done with the school year (she already was grounded for throwing my son's favorite toy away for no reason). 

I went to grab her keys. Next thing I knew she's gone. I start to look for her. Then I hear crying. Then Chloe yelling ""That's for snitching on me!"" She punched my 9 year old son as hard she possibly could. He was in tears on the floor curling up in a ball. 

I told Chloe that's enough. Told her to pack her things and she's not welcome in our house again. She cried and kept apologizing saying she won't do it again, when I know she will. I told her she has to leave immediately. 

She grabbed her things and I tossed her the keys to her car and said ""I'll deposit $250 in you account. That'll be enough for a hotel for a little bit. Figure out where you'll be staying."" She left within 10 minutes. 

I go to check on my son and he has a massive red mark on his stomach. I took him to the hospital and the doctor said he will be fine after time (btw that was fun having to explain to the police). I check on it the next day and it is MASSIVE. 

While all this was happening my wife was on a business trip and I explained everything to her. She thinks that we should have dealt with her in another way. I disagree saying that we should have done this a long time ago.

We both wanted to post this on here and ask what could have I done differently to fix this. 

TLDR: 18 year old daughter punched my 9 year old son as hard as she could. Made her leave and find her own living arrangements.

"[IN] 4 days ago I accidentally almost got into the wrong car, causing the elderly woman inside the car to try to flee and she fell. Today I was told I'd be sued if I didn't pay ambulance & ER bills.","
Four days ago (Monday 11/4) I was parked in a very full parking lot and returned to my car in a distracted state. I didn't realize that I was parked next to a car that was identical to mine. I opened the unlocked driver's side door and put my leg in, but immediately withdrew my leg because I heard someone inhale sharply and then heard the passenger side door open. Obviously this wasn't my car so I began apologizing and, as I was shutting the door, I could see an elderly woman struggling to get out of the car.

I was still apologizing when she fell out of the car. I went around quickly and asked if she was alright, did she need me to call an ambulance, did she need me to go find whoever she was waiting for, etc. She told me I didn't need to call an ambulance, but asked if I would stay with her until her daughter came back. She didn't know which store her daughter was in and didn't have her number memorized. I helped her back into the passenger seat. 

She had an abrasion on her right palm, which I offered to disinfect since I keep a first aid kit in my car. She accepted and said she wasn't hurt anywhere else, just shaken up. She asked me for water and I gave her a bottle from my car. She told me she was diabetic and that her blood sugar was low and she didn't have her insulin with her, so I offered her a banana. We spent about 5 or so minutes together before her daughter came running up.

We explained to her what happened and the daughter was pissed at me, rightfully so since I did scare her mother and she fell. I offered again to call an ambulance to make sure she was alright and they both refused. I suggested they take her to her doctor as soon as possible to make sure she didn't injure anything from the fall. I apologized again and went home. 

This morning the daughter and her husband showed up on my front porch. I think they were trying to intimidate me since the husband stood there the entire time with his arms crossed and with what I assume was supposed to be a scary look on his face. 
The elderly woman and I only exchanged first names so I don't know how they found out who I am or where I lived. I asked and they said they ""had their ways."" The daughter told me she ended up calling an ambulance because her mother began to have a panic attack before they left the parking lot. I asked if she was okay and she told me that wasn't any of my business. She said that they were going to sue me if I didn't pay the ER bill and the ambulance bill. They said they wanted $3,500. I asked if her mother had insurance and was again told it wasn't my business. I asked to see the bills because I obviously have my doubts and they said they didn't have them with them. I said ""So you expect me to just hand you $3,500?"" and that pissed them both off. I told them to get off of my property and that I'd call the police if they refused or came back. I told them to have their lawyer contact me. They both called me a bitch and left. 

I've included every detail I can think of, so my question is could they really sue me? I understand you can basically sue anyone for anything, but am I legally responsible to pay these medical bills if they do in fact exist? 

Thanks in advance. I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting errors. 

Edit: Thank you to those who responded. I'm 31, but often get mistaken for someone much younger. The daughter and her husband are, or look to be, in their mid to late forties. I suspect they may just have seen what they think to be a young and naive woman that may be dumb/scared enough to pay them.

[Texas] School sent a letter that our atheist student club will not be permitted this school year. Invited us to join Christian clubs instead.,"I'm 16 years old. In the last couple of years me and a friend founded an atheist student club in our school to provide a non-religious alternative to the Christian clubs that already existed. Last year we had 22 members. We are the only specifically non-religious club. This is a public school.

The letter says that the club is banned from the school in the coming school year due to the complaints from the parents that the club is encouraging lifestyle that they find unacceptable for their children. We do not bully or troll people. We just do what other clubs do without being religious. We accept all people and have no condition on atheism. Last year we had a Muslim and a Pagan student and everyone loves it.

The complaints are from the parents who don't like that their kids are not as religious as they are. We had a few members whose parents were very religious but they were not. Last year they complained but school took our side. I guess this year they gave in.

I went to the school today and talked to the assistant principal who said that they can't ignore complaints from parents and told me to forget about this.

I'm not a lawyer but doesn't the first amendment protect our right to freedom of and from religion? I don't think they can just say they can ban us because some parents don't like the atheist lifestyle.

First is the law on our side? And if so what resources I can use to fight the school's decision? My parents will not pay for a lawyer. ",legaladvice

"[Ontario] Wedding is in 2 days, venue is telling us they cannot accommodate us anymore, also cannot give us our refund because our deposit was with the previous owners.","I am getting married on Sunday. In early 2018 we found a decent venue with Company A who also provided catering, photgraphy, etc for weddings. We signed a contract with Company A and put a fairly heft deposit on our wedding reception.

In October 2018 we got an email from our wedding venue owners who let us know as of January 1st, the venue would be under new management. However this email assured us that the new owners are honoring all reservations, and we had nothing to worry about. To be sure i contacted the venue in Late October and confirmed with the venue we were still on for January. At the start of January our wedding coordinator also verified and ensured everything was fine for our wedding with the new owners.

Yesterday night our wedding coordinator contacted me after she went to go speak directly with the venue, apparently they were extremely confused because not **MY** wedding, but someone else's wedding is on Sunday according to them.

Today me, my husband and our wedding coordinator, went down to the venue with a copy of contract. The manager of the venue told us he had no record of our wedding, or our deposit. Furthermore apparently my contract with the wedding venue is for the previous owners and not them, so if we have a problem with this we are supposed to go take it up with the original owners.

When our wedding coordinator brought up the fact that she had talked to them at the start of January to confirm, he apparently thought it was for the other wedding. He apologized and said he didn't actually confirm by name on the date.

Furthermore since they don't have a record of our wedding they have no record of our deposit so they can't give a refund. He gave us a phone number for the previous owners which was a disconnected number. At this point i became very upset, and we were told to leave immediately.

People who raise their children genderless should be fined/jailed or have their child taken away,"It's one thing to accept your child being transsexual, or whatever. It's another thing to confuse them just Incase they're one of the very few people in this group (around .6 percent of adults in the United States). You alienate your children at such a young age from normal peer groups and hurting them in the long run. I can't imagine growing up and having to figure out what gender I was with no guidance from my parents when it's a far too complicated issue to be worried about as a small child.

Edit- I've tried to respond to everyone but there's just too many people and I'm saying the same stuff over and over
I'm against extreme genderless parenting. It's okay to not only give your kid girly/boyish things, or not only have them wear girly/boyish. Let kids play with what they want to play with. However, when you don't teach children their sex is connected to their gender, you're confusing young, impressionable children. Why would you not use pronouns if the chances are your kids gender is going to be the same as their sex. You're confusing children making them worry about their gender identity when they're just kids. If you're kids talk about being transgendered and not feeling like their sex and wants you to call them something that's different. Why treat your kid different just Incase they're transgendered? It almost seems like while their hearts in the right place they subconsciously want them to be a different gender and push their kids towards that. Let your kids be normal unless you have reason to believe otherwise. Please. ",unpopularopinion

AITA for not giving the source of my beaded earrings to a white woman?,"I was born on a Res and lived there for most of my life until going to college in a nearby state. In my community, we have a number of talented women who are amazing at beading. They make some truly remarkable stuff. Caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. It's just how they do it. 

I have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. Almost every day I wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who I am, where I'm from, etc. Brings me a lot of joy.

Anyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. She compliments them and examines them. No issue there. Lots of people do. One day recently though, she asked me where I got them and if the person has an ""Etsy"" shop or something where she can buy her own. This woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. 

Now... personally I have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! It's not about that. Wear whatever you want. But the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). It's just not done. 

I told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. I told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. She kept pressing me, telling me ""Well let her make that decision!"" and stuff like that. 

I got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. She got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to HR about me being racially discriminating.

AITA? 

My reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make ""boho style"" earrings), etc. She is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",AmItheAsshole

I put on my sports bra which is zip at the front and has a few clips on the inside as well but because my mum was rushing me I skipped the clips thinking it will be fine. Spoiler alert - it wasn't fine.

TIFU by throwing my runty and mentally challenged kitten in the trash,"Maybe this is over dramatic, but I will forever feel horrible for this.

For some background, my kitten Bones is the runt of our latest litter, and is 10 weeks old. She's really tiny, about half the size of her siblings. I say 'mentally-challenged' because she's kind of stupid. By this I mean she walks into walls, off of edges, and into our other pets- and is completely stunned by this. She has to take a whole minute to figure out how to jump a short distance. At first we thought she was blind, but it turns out she's just kind of slow I guess. When she wants attention or food she headbutts the wall. When she 'runs' she opens her mouth to breath and drools everywhere. She's also somewhat cross-eyed, and also walks really weird, with her tail straight up, back legs bent like she's crouching, and her ass half-way to the ground. We actually even named her Bones because when she walks, her hip bone juts out in a way that it's very prominent. 
We took her to the vet last week, and he said she was perfectly healthy now besides breathing problems, but we should watch out for possible seizures in the future. He thinks she probably got dropped by her mom when she was a few days old, and that could be why she's kind of weird.

So anyways, she's my favorite little kitten out of the litter. Even though she's quirky, she's very loving and fun to play with. Her favorite thing to do is curl up against my neck and cuddle. 
Two days ago at 4 AM I had just finished binging GoT and went to go throw away the wrapper of a popsicle I'd eaten. She's small enough to fit in my palm, so I got lazy and was carrying her and holding the popsicle wrapper in the same hand. This was a really stupid decision. 

I popped open the metal trash can and without even thinking, threw her and the wrapper in the trash. I didn't even register it until I heard a loud thunk and strained 'mrow'. It hit me and I rushed to turn the light on I could pull the top off and see inside. This happened to be the same night my mom decided to clear all the leftovers from the fridge into the trash can. So she was covered in a ton of old, sloppy food (mostly enchiladas and spaghetti). She also had somehow hit her face. She had a really bloody nose she kept sneezing from and I swear her head had a little bump that looked dark under the fur.

I panicked and took her to the bathroom to wipe her down. The second she heard the water she scratched the hell out of my hand and pissed and shit all over herself. I felt horrible. I got a washcloth and wiped her down the best I could, but she wasn't happy at all and her bloody nose kept going. 
It eventually stopped but I still felt like shit. She didn't trust me for the rest of the night or the next day, and kept running away from me. She didn't eat at all and only laid in the same place. I was so scared I had given her severe brain damage or something crazy. She warmed up to me again, but I will forever feel horrible.

Also the scratches she gave me got infected and pus-filled, so there's that. I deserve it. 

Tl;dr: Was too lazy to hold my runty and mentally challenged kitten and trash in different hands, so I accidentally threw her into a metal trash can so hard I gave her a horrible bloody nose and bump. Also got infected scratches from trying to help her, which I more than deserve.

EDIT: Bones is okay!! She's still being her derpy self, walking off beds and into walls. Nothing is broken and she isn't in any pain! She's eating and running just like before :)
(Also fixed the post because my sister reminded me that she's 10 weeks, not 8)

EDIT 2: Since so many of you asked, here she is!
https://imgur.com/gallery/9vy8T36

EDIT 3: I have decided I'm going to make up for this horrendous sin by dedicating the rest of my life to making sure she's healthy, happy, and loved.

EDIT 4: I'm really sorry for flooding this posts with edits, but I'd like to keep you all informed. The commenters telling me I should get her checked anyways are right. Next week when Bones goes to get shots, I will have the vet check her out and I'm also going to ask about the chance of her still being potentially blind (many of you pointed out her unfocused eyes) and Cerebullar Hypoplasio (which her mama also has!). Because a week is a long time to be in potential pain, I'm having my mom's friend (another vet) come over tomorrow to check her out and hopefully give me the brands of potential painkillers she can safely take as a baby. 
Thank you all for the advice and support! ❤️

EDIT 5: I've already gotten a dozen or so comments asking that I fix her mama because she shouldn't be breeding if she has a neurological disorder. And I completely agree! 
But the problem here is that Bones' mama isn't my cat. She's my sister's cat, and my sister is refusing to fix her. She actually was going to, but then we found out she was pregnant with Bones' litter, and spaying a preggo cat = murder in my sister's eyes, I guess. 
I fully plan on spaying Bones ASAP! I disagree with breeding and if I could fix my sister's cat, I would. 
Sorry if I confused anyone!

AITA for letting my 3 year old disabled son have a head start at a family race?,"Recent weekend get together with my extended family, and we were having a bbq. My sister in law had put up kiddie games etc that the kids were competing in and there were candy prizes. 

She'd set up a race for the small kids- under 5's, because there's a lot of those in my family. It was a simple straight line race and there were literal kiddy plastic markers and a start and finish sign. 

My 3 year old boy has a knee that hasn't developed properly- he's in physical therapy, miiiight need an operation as he gets older, but mostly the poor kid finds it hard to run or walk and has a little funny limp that slows him down. 

As it was a goddamn kids race and I just wanted my son to be happy, when the kids crowded around to start the race I said 'Chris should get a head start' mostly kidding. My brother, other sister in law, and mom and dad all enthusiastically agreed and it was actually my brother who let my son a few feet ahead of the start line and then gave the instruction for all the other kids to follow. 

My son won, but not because the other kids were slow- most of em meandered falling over, some of em were chewing the grass- some of ran straight to mom or dad ignoring the finish line, just doing what kids do. There were no actual 5 year olds, just a few kids my sons age and younger. 

My sister in law who was hosting the party was super pissy about it and purposefully withheld a prize from Chris. I figured that was fair enough because he cheated, but she kept shaking her head at him saying 'bad! You cheated' which pissed me off. He's a kid. Who had a lot of fun in the race. Wtf dude. 

My wife kept the situation calm and smoothed it over because she kept going out of her way to upset the kiddo even though she'd made her point, but I don't think my giving a goddamn 3 year old at a family bbq a head start should have been so controversial.",AmItheAsshole

I was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. This made me realize what I would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**Warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- Hospital HVACS systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. I was told they could only bump it up or down here at my VA hospital. Also, this was the first time I received an IV treatment and let me tell you they are cold... Had an IV in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and I am pretty convinced I could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**Warm, comfortable socks**- Reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. Maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *Credit*: /u/Getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so I followed up and asked my nurse about this.  Turns out, the VA hospital does have socks available and my new RN was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**Condiments** - I believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. This problem might be compounded by medication. May have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **EDIT** I recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  Generally, it would be wiser to consult with the RN or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**Open toe slippers**- Luckily I had flip flops on when I was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. Making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if I only had tennis shoes. Probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**Long, braided phone charger** - My wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. I can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. I recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. Also, I am using a 5ft USB hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**Entertainment**: A book, eReader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   The TV service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. Another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. If they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. The gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *EDIT* /u/stjernDale recommended audiobooks.  Great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**Gift Cards**: *Credit: /u/1900grs, /u/HalftimeHeaters.*  Gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*Bonus LPT*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  They take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  This bonus LPT is intended for *adult patients.*

**Power Bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  This was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


Edit 2

**Eye Mask & Ear plugs** - /u/Ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/SuedeVeil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  Especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

TIFU by Smeagoling at my new job,"This happened today. About 20 minutes ago, to be more precise.

I just started a new job about a month ago. It's a quiet office environment. I only really know the people immediately around me, but everyone's been super nice to me so far.

One of the things I love about this place is they have a bunch of free breakfast stuff in the break room. This morning I thought a bagel sounded nice so I went to go toast one up. This is where the FU begins. 

I separated the bagel into two halves and went to put it in the toaster. I've only ever owned peasant toasters, but this stainless-steel bad boy had all the bells and whistles, including a ""bagel"" setting. I figured it wouldn't hurt so I punched it and waited. 

While I stood there my mind began to drift. I started thinking about Lord of the Rings for some reason, specifically trying to figure out when my kids would be old enough for me to introduce them to it. I heard the door to the break room shut and assumed the only person who had been in there with me had just left.

Then the toaster dinged and my bagel popped up. I took it out and was struck by how amazingly it had toasted. Warm and soft on the outside, toasted perfection on the inside. I started spreading the butter, still admiring the flawless bagel in my hands. My brain was still in fantasy mode though, and I said to myself in full-on Smeagol voice, ""Oooh yes! We likes it! Gives it to us golden and crispy!""

At this point, my rational brain kicked back in and I realized how fucking weird I can be sometimes. Oh well, no big deal. I take my bagel and turn around, nearly running into a group of ladies looking at me like I just arrived from another planet. I tried to give a polite smile, but I'm sure the surprise and wave of awkwardness I was experiencing made that creepy too. I shuffled past them and am now hiding at my desk. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before ""the new guy"" is rebranded as ""the multiple personality weirdo who talks to himself."" Shit.

TL;DR Talked like Smeagol while buttering my bagel and was overhead by my new coworkers. Instant shame.",tifu

I work at a company that happens to employ a lot of transgender people. I am born male, I dress masculine, and go by he/him. Yesterday at work I was working with a new woman (was told they are MtF, which is fine). Yesterday they asked me what my preferred pronouns are and I said he/him. They then proceeded to whisper to me something along the lines of ""you pass very well as a man!"". It sounded like a compliment  but it made me really uncomfortable. I told them that I was actually born male and they just said ""oh"" and went back to what they were doing.

I think my 12yo daughter is being groomed online (WA State),"My 12yo daughter got introduced to Discord (a chat app) by a friend. She has since been involved in some pretty explicit sexual role play with what I can only assume are grown men. We have blocked all her access to the internet at home. She's given out our home number in the past, the town we live in, and her full name. She has recently been given a cell phone so that she can reach me during the day while I'm at work, and recently she's given  (at least) of these men her cell number and I've discovered some pretty gnarly messages. 

I've done a reverse phone look up and this particular guy seems to be in Ontario. 

He has told her that he is 18. I'm willing to bet he's older.

 She needs to be scared straight and this guy needs to know he's talking to a child. 

My husband says we need to call the police. 

I don't even know where to start. 

Can someone point me in the right direction. I'll be bringing it up to her therapist in the morning. 

[EDIT]

She has a therapist, thank you.  She is well supported at home, encouraged, etc.  Thank you, also, for all the parenting advice in a legal advice sub.  That was unexpected but not surprising.  This kid is well supported at home, cared for, encouraged, and supported in any way imaginable.  She's never been spanked, rarely yelled at, etc.  We are not permissive but neither are we oppressive.  She went down the anime path, which turned into the furry path, which escalated to the BDSM/Role Play sex chat that she's currently engaged in and I'm not even sure she knows what some of these things are she's talking about with these men.  I'm thinking she should watch the Cyntoia Brown documentary.  I've gone through her Discord chat history and it looks like she's telling people we abuse her, her dad is horrible, and that she's alone all the time (which, for the record, is by choice because I literally try to include her in EVERYTHING), all kinds of drama.  

Her phone is a basic flip-phone with no data plan. No apps.  I'm going to contact her school this morning and get her chromebook access revoked.

I spoke with our county sheriff.  Unless she told them her age explicitly, they won't do anything.  I connected with a guy using her Discord account and he eventually told me he thought she was 16.  He's clearly done this before, as 16 is a threshhold age.

I went through a bad break up last year, and haven't had much luck dating since, so I decided what the hell, I'll try a little strange, and asked her out for a drink.  It went great.  Really great. We've been seeing each other for about two months now. 

Here's my problem, I'm pretty straight laced. I come from a conservative family, I have a conservative job, my bosses are country club types, I wear a suit to work and play golf on the weekends. She on the other hand is heavily tattooed, which I always found trashy before but for some reason I find it incredibly sexy on her. She's slightly punk, and is all around the opposite of me. 

If I decide to get serious with her, my family is going to freak out, I can't see them ever approving of her.  She will hurt my reputation at work and not be good for my career. It sucks but is just straight up true. My friends think it's weird that I'm dating her and think I'm going through something because of my break up. And this is going to make me sound like an asshole but I am a little worried about what my ex is going to think. I feel like she'll think I'm trying to get back at her for dumping me.  

Here's the thing though, I'm crazy about this girl. She's gorgeous, successful, driven (wants to open her own shop), off the charts confident, talented, smart, sexy and just all around cool. Sex with her is without a doubt the best I've ever had. She's uninhibited and does things to me that I didn't know I wanted. It's dirty and primal. I've had to start jerking off before I see her because I don't last more than two minutes otherwise. She laughs at my shitty jokes. We have a lot in common, like we both love action movies and whiskey. She's introduced me to things I never would have even given a chance before.  Honestly if it weren't for the judgement, I would marry her tomorrow. 

I've worked really hard for my career and I'm not sure I want to potentially jeopardize it.  But on the other hand I've never felt this way about anyone. She's everything I didn't know I wanted. I'm torn. Really really torn. 

Should I say fuck it and go for it with her?

Edit:  I want to thank everyone for their comments, especially the harsh ones. It's really made me take a hard look at myself and I realize that this is 100% about my hang ups. I have been a lot more judgmental than I ever stopped to consider.  I'm going to work on changing that about myself. 

I'm going to go for it, I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life if I don't. I'm going to tell her how I feel about her tomorrow. This may have been premature (depending on how tomorrow goes) but I called my sister and told her about my  (hopefully) new girlfriend.  She was supportive, but she did share the same concerns about our parents. But fuck it, and soon as she's open to it, I'm going to have her meet them. 

Hopefully I'll have a good update tomorrow!  
Thanks again.",relationship_advice
Parents shouldn't post pictures of their kids in the bath.,"Regardless if they used a cute little emoji or not to cover up their private parts, bath time is a private time that *shouldn't* be posted for the world to see. Or, at least keep these photos for a private collection. How exposed do you think these kids are going to feel down the road when these pictures pop up in memories or get reshared to their social media? We're preaching to kids to respect their bodies, but how can they do that when parents violate that trust from the start?",unpopularopinion
Landlord left door unlocked with a note saying so. Everything of value was stolen.,"I reported a maintenance issue to my landlord and he scheduled a repair person to come last Friday.  The landlord asked me to be there, I told him I couldn't, he asked me to leave the door unlocked, I told him I couldn't.  I asked him to be there for the repair, and he agreed.

He apparently came over late Thursday and unlocked the door, then put a note on it to the company literally SAYING the door was unlocked and asking them to lock it when they leave. 

I arrived home on Saturday night to find that the company never actually showed up and the door had been unlocked the whole time.  Everything of value was stolen and a number of things that weren't valuable were still broken/vandalized. 

I filed a police report. Then, since my landlord had agreed to be there for the repair person, I contacted him thinking he must have forgotten to lock up.  That's when I learned that he just came over and unlocked it a day early and left it that way.

I know it has only been a day, but so far my landlord takes no responsibility with what happened and I am afraid that won't change.  Is there anything legal I can do?

I need to go through the purchases but I believe the total amount of items stolen and items damaged is about $15,000 that I paid.

(It won't be covered by rental insurance, BTW, already looked into it.)

TIFU by unknowingly doping for the entire school year,"This TIFU has been in the making since last September. This is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

Late last summer I started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. Naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. I'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

Though I've always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call I needed to start working out. Beside hitting the gym, I also joined a sharpshooting club, and was I was natural at it. Over the course of a few months I moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. My aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

I'm pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but I sure as hell didn't. In the meantime a cardiologist said ""Tough shit"" and bumped up the meds.

During the course of this school year I was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. Soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. The stakes were high, but I was a stone cold shooter. Later that day checking out my Fitbit, I found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when I had to bicycle over the the range.

Flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. My friend jokingly mentioned that I must've been doping to do so well and the dots connected. I googled ""metoprolol doping"", there it was. I still haven't told anyone, but Reddit. What the hell do I do now?

TL:DR Started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug.",tifu
TIFU by unwrapping a condom,"So this happened earlier in the week but is NSFW so posting on the weekend. Also on my throwaway acc. since I don't want this story going back to the IRL me.

So at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. I'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. It never has and so I took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

Anyway, I'm on intersemester break right now so I (19M) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. I decided I'd open the wrapper since I'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and I thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

As I discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason I took a smell since I could kind of tell it smelt weird.

When I did this, I realised that I had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. I have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when I was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. Except now I realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. I felt pretty sick then.

I wish I could delete memories and that I'd never remembered/realised this.

TL;DR  got out a condom to try it out, realised I've tasted condoms before.

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. I have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. I think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.

I think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that ""pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc."" I'm also from New Zealand, not North America as a few have assumed. Here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me ""the talk"" either.

The ""balloon"" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.

Thank you for the awards, I wish they could make me forget, at least there is a small positive now from fake internet points.",tifu
"[UPDATE] This man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, I have a specific question regarding something I want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.","I would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). Sorry for not updating you right away as I was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

So here's what happened. I liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. So I hired a guy which I'll call him Frank.

After waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

A few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom I recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. We went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. Shockingly he was completely understanding. He told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both Frank and I a settlement if I agree not to sue. I called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed Frank for his drone plus way more money that I would've ever paid him. He also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that I wont pursue any legal action.

It was a happy ending and I was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but I must admit that I feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. Never have I felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. While we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! So the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and I'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",legaladvice

AITA for refusing to cook my boyfriends steak rare?,"I've been with my boyfriend for a couple years and normally we get on wonderfully and there's 0 clash of personality. 

One of the things that we don't always see eye to eye on is food- I love to cook and experiment with food, and he is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. 

I recently ate a steak that was well done that tasted REALLY good. I know there's going to be a lot of people turning their noses up and saying 'impossible' but honestly, it was delicious and I wanted to try and recreate it at home. 

I asked my boyfriend if he would be interested if I purchased some steaks and I specified it was an experiment to give the well done steak a try at home. He said he was on board. 

On the day of I prepped and was ready to go. At the last minute he decided he wanted it rare. I was super disappointed and irritated because I wouldn't have ordinarily bought the steaks midweek, it was specially to give this a try- and I was excited because I thought he could try it and I had a feeling he'd enjoy it.

I said I was NOT preparing him a rare steak. I said if he wanted to cook his own steak rare that was fine but I had been excited to prepare this for him. I ended up cooking my own steak and he ended up making his own. He's been telling everyone and anyone that I'm petty and should have just accepted that he changed his mind.",AmItheAsshole
[KY] A stripper pole was installed inside my office,"About a month ago, I was hired at a small tech company. When I arrived, I noticed I was the only woman in an office of at least 30 people. I just disregarded it as a coincidence at the time, but I now realize it was because of the workplace. I am intimidated on an almost daily basis by my coworkers.

Several of the employees have attempted to make romantic advances on me. These range from awkwardly asking me out (which I don't mind, but I am in a committed relationship, but they still keep asking) to ""accidentally"" brushing their hand against my butt. And these were not one time advances. Today when I came in, there was a new pole that had been installed in the middle of the office. When I asked my boss, he said they had discovered a ""sag in the ceiling tiles"" and that this was a temporary fix (although it seems a bit small for that), but after lunch several of the guys came up to me and one said ""why don't you show us why you were really hired"" At that point, I excused myself to use the bathroom and then left shortly after, saying I wasn't feeling well.

I could brush off the compliments and asking me out as awkward engineers being awkward engineers (and not getting the message after several times), but the brushing their hand on my butt and now this? I am furious. When I told my boyfriend, he suggested I post here since you guys would probably know where to go. Should I quit? Complain to the boss? Call the police?

"[Nevada] HOA says we're violating ""single family"" clause. We're siblings living together, also not a member of HOA at all. They also want our pool removed & limit us to 2 cars. They have signatures to have us join!","Ok I don't even know where to begin.

Me and my two sisters inherited this property from our grandparents. It was their rental property. We demolished and rebuilt everything from scratch for ourselves to use as the main home for our family. We built a pool and a sauna. We live here now.

During construction the HOA president visited me and told us that that our design violates HOA's renovation guidelines. He also said that the pool and sauna are violations of the bylaws. I reminded him that we're not members of the HOA and have no interest in joining.

In the last 6 months we've received numerous letters from the HOA either compelling us to join or inform us of our infractions. They're either about the pool, about the fact that we have 3 cars, or that we're not a single family (apparently brothers and sisters are not family now according to this HOA).

We also received letters saying if we join the HOA the fees will be waived for the next 5 years.

This last week though the president brought us a form showing that there has been 45 signatures by the neighbors saying our way of life and our non-compliance with the HOA bylaws has significantly devalued their properties and has cost them stress and they would want us to become a member. The president says this is enough to get a court order requiring us to become a member. He says the neighbors will be willing to testify in court as well. He says to avoid the legal fees on both our parts, he's willing to give us the 5 year waiver of the fees.

First I have no intention of joining this HOA. They've proven themselves to be exactly the type of HOA to not want to be associated with.

Second, is it true that a court can order you to join a HOA? This seems weird. Are they bullying us into joining?

How do I tell my sister I don't want my unvaccinated nieces to visit my newborn?,"So a little bit of pretext, I live several states away from my family so seeing them is far and few between. In January I found out I was pregnant after losing twins last year, so my family is ecstatic to say the least. My sister and her husband are going through some financial struggles so I understand it's difficult to make a trip to visit, so it came as a shock when she suggested the other day, they wanted to plan a trip up here when the baby is born. The problem is she's an anti vaxxer. 

I have two nieces, 7 and 4, who haven't gotten a single vaccine in their life. I love my sister dearly, but she firmly believes in the hype surrounding their dangers, along with many beliefs with western medicine. They have no health insurance and when the kids are sick, she takes them to a chiropractor. Every food must be gluten free, organic, natural, because, without testing, she just ""knows"" her children have egg, dye, and gluten allergies. Ironically she's also a massive germaphobe, keeping her kids homeschooled. My point is not to knock her, my point is to stress how much of a lifestyle this whole thing is and therefore not as easy as just saying she does one thing but not the other. She is a full 100% on board with the term ""vegan crunchy granola mom"". 

Last year she talked about coming up alone to visit my twins which wasn't a problem (we were vaccinated as children) but now her mentioning bringing up the kids when my baby is about 2-3 months old and therefore not up to date with shots, is sadly not an option. I was scared before but now with the measles making a comeback I'm even more freaked out and don't know how to word this. 

I know she's going to be offended and I know she's going to be upset but this is not an option nor is it up for debate. She chooses to believe in not vaccinating but my husband and I firmly believe in science and medicine and after losing two children I'll be damned if I put another child in harm's way. Any advice on how I can word this to soften the blow would be very much appreciated. Like I said, this is not a negotiation and it's a firm no they can't come up but I'm sure there's a better way to word this than, ""I'm terrified your children are going to kill mine.""

Update: Thank you so much to everyone who commented and left suggestions on how to proceed with this! I had the talk with my sister and while keeping it courteous but not personal, she was very understanding to my concern. Ironically, she was nervous about the notion of being around my child once he/she *was* vaccinated as she believes the vaccine can shed and therefore infect her kids (but that's another story!) It ended on a good note with no bloodshed with her respecting waiting until my baby is good and vaccinated. Thank you again to everyone, this was quite the success story!",relationship_advice
"TIFU by going outside with my parakeet, because I thought he wouldn't fly away.","Mandatory ""This didn't happen today."", it happened yesterday morning though. English is my first language, roast me.

&#x200B;

It's a bit of a light-novel so I've put a TL; DR at the bottom

Cast

Neighbors 1 & 2

Me

Brothers 1, 2 & 3

Jimmy

&#x200B;

Early morning yesterday,  my  next door neighbor (Neighbor 1) came to knock on my door, telling me that my other neighbor (Neighbor 2) was locked in his house and he couldn't get through to his wife, who left with their keys. So, my brothers (Brothers 1 & 3) went out to the backyard (where there are two houses)  to try and help. The landlord left some keys over at our place, so my brothers took those to try and get Neighbor 2 out of his house. I went over to the back door to see what was happening and my younger brother asked if I could call the landlord up to see if we could get him to come over with some keys.

&#x200B;

I walked back to the house, made the call and then on my way out to the backyard, I, stupidly, walked past my bird, Jimmy, who was on his cage and let him on to my shoulder. I went through the kitchen with him on my shoulder, and out on to the porch. As I came out on to the porch, Brother 1 told me ""Take him back! He's gonna fly away again."". And I jokingly said, ""He won't fly away, he's a good boy."". I then saw a bucket of water on the porch that I had been using the previous day to clean. I got this stupid idea to prove to my brother that Jimmy would not fly away and I picked the bucket up by its' handle, stepped of the porch and into the backyard. As I started pouring the water into a drain, the water made a huge sloshing sound, consequently scaring Jimmy and thus leading him to fly off.

&#x200B;

Me and my two brothers started screaming in horror as we watched him fly over Neighbor 2's house and into the Great Beyond. I panicked and climbed over our back gate into a gated back alley trying to see where he might have went. All the while my two brothers were running out to the front of the house to the street. I started screaming for Jimmy trying to here where he was. After a few minutes, my brother had opened the back gate trying to see where Jimmy might have flown to.

&#x200B;

And so began the first search. We walked around our block, thinking he didn't go that far as he only flies around inside our house. Eventually, we heard him calling and we followed his voice to a tree in another neighbor's  house. We called out, a lady came out and we asked if we could take a look in her back yard. After we got into the yard, we heard him in a tree in another yard. So we went into the back alley behind our house, over a rusted gate and into the yard of an abandoned house that burned down. I called out again and Jimmy called back. His voice was pretty loud, so I knew he was near. After looking around for a bit, I spotted him on a branch. I climbed all the way up to him, but as I got about three feet away from him on the branch he was sitting on, he got spooked and flew off again.

&#x200B;

Though out the day, my three brothers and I walked all over our neighborhood asking neighbors if they saw anything and calling out to Jimmy in every tree we saw. My brothers were pretty cool about it, even though it was clearly my fault that Jimmy got away. They tried to make me feel better and they didn't bring it up at all. We walked all morning, it was kinda cold and it was lightly raining on and off. At some point there was a bit of wind. Needless to say, it was shitty weather for flying. I just kept thinking he was sitting somewhere wet and freezing and it's all my fault.

&#x200B;

Come afternoon, we had walked the neighborhood more times than I can count and my mother even drove us around one last time to look for Jimmy. We were dog tired and couldn't go anymore. My Brother 1 went out one last time and when he came back I saw him sobbing in his bedroom, Brother 3 was trying to console him. He just kept saying ""I don't know where he is.... I don't know where that guy is."" My Brother 1 was really fond of the parakeet and he was taking it pretty hard. I just felt like shit, everyone was upset and they didn't want to even say that it was my fault, which it really was.

&#x200B;

That night we didn't even have dinner, we all just went to sleep. I kept waking up, my body hurt, I was worried about Jimmy and I felt like I could just die. Thinking about Jimmy all alone through the cold night was killing me, I couldn't relax. That was probably the worst I've ever slept in my life. I couldn't stop feeling guilty.

&#x200B;

This morning, I waited for the Sun to come out and then Brother 2 and I went out again. We went back to the abandoned house and called for Jimmy again. No answer. We walked about the neighborhood again and called with no answer. We sort of just wondered off and called for him. We went through a really nice neighborhood and then we found ourselves in a field/bush. We followed a footpath that lead to a path made by a car (dunno what that's called) and then followed that road to a steel mill. We asked a guy working there if he had seen or heard a green parakeet with a red beak, he said he hadn't and that he had only got there a few minutes ago. So, we walked off. We walked along a fence a few feet from the steel mill, and continued calling him. He answered. The sound came from one of the trees in the fenced area.

&#x200B;

We ran back to the steel mill and asked if they had a key to get into the fenced area. Apparently, it was someone's house. The owner of the house came to his door and he was in a wheelchair we called from his gate and asked if we could come in to his yard. He then called his dog and locked the dog in the house and told us we could come it. We hopped his gate and started calling again. After a few seconds we heard him louder and I started climbing a tree where I heard the sound the loudest. I couldn't really see him so, I told my brother ""Jimmy must be really high up because I can't see him. Go home and get Brothers 1 and 3 and bring the cage and a ladder. We could try to put the cage on the roof (flat top) and let Jimmy fly over to his cage."" Brother 2 left and got a lift from one of the guys to our house.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, I spotted Jimmy and climbed higher to try and get to him. Eventually, I was about a foot away from him. I tried to get him to come to me, but he got spooked again, and I saw him fly to another tree. I climbed down the tree and went to stand at the foot of the second tree. By then my brothers 2 & 3 showed up with the cage, they couldn't get a ladder. So, I tried to come up with a new plan. I set the cage down a distance from the second tree and tried to see if I could get him to fly down. He wouldn't budge. I told Brother 2 to go home and get Brother 1, because the bird is more fond of him and maybe he would fly down for him. And I asked them to bring some bird seeds and some fruits/vegetables to try and lure him down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When Brother 1 showed up, we tried to lure Jimmy down for about 10 minutes and he just wouldn't budge. He called out like he wanted to come down and he tried to climb, but I guess he was a bit scared or something. I was too scared to climb up, because it was a really high tree, maybe 30-40 feet and I didn't was to scare Jimmy off again. Brother 1 told me I had to try to climb the tree because Jimmy was not going to come down. So, I did. I took a carrot in my hoodie's pocket and started climbing. When I got near to Jimmy, instead of approaching him, I started chewing on the carrot. My logic was that he was probably really hungry after being out for 24+ hours. Naturally, he started inching towards me. When he seemed to be comfortable with me just sitting near me, I steadied myself and grabbed him. He chewed up my hands a bit, but I just kept a firm, but gentle grip on him. I had my hoodie up so I shoved him in there behind my head. He stopped screaming and just held on to my hair with his feet. I just started crying... I couldn't believe all of this had happened. I was so relieved. I climbed down from the tree, and my brothers and I drove home with the guy from the steel mill. It was a wild two days. I have for sure learned my lesson. I will never take Jimmy outside again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR I took my pet parakeet outside despite my brothers explicit instructions not to, ended up on a two day long bird hunt and brought misery to my family... And then finally finding the mad lad in the next neighborhood.

"Telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not WHY we are really afraid.","Anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the Kavanaugh hearings. Resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

The conversation went as such: If you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. Furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

Yeah. No shit. The reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **OR** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). So... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

What ISN'T outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. The implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* In effect, it was a lie by omission. 

And the above really isn't my point anyways. Here's the main point:

*In a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. There are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

So, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* Where's the deterrent there? 

Another question that I have never once seen given a good answer:

How does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? This is how *most* consent occurs anyways. Other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? Throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: Intimacy with a Woman. 

We have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

Lastly: I want to be wrong. 

Here's what you can do if I am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard I've found. 

I'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that I am *nowhere close* to being alone here. Relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. You won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on Facebook. Talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on Reddit at least.  

So, if I am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that I am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

LPT: Never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it.,"It may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve VS an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best. 

In my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response. 

This does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.

Edit: Couple of things that have come up

1. Time frame - I wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. You can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.

2. Trivial Matters - Obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.

3. You should just make the decision yourself - In many situations this is correct from a pure ""efficiency"" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.

4. Management Perspective - I AM NOT currently a manager, over the past 20 years I have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, I am not complaining about my current situation, I am very happy and follow this LPT on a daily basis.

Edit 2: Thankyou all so much, I really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other LPT I follow is ""Seek first to understand"" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.

My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.,"My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

TIFU by teaching my baby sign language,"I go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. Not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a Christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (AKA she doesn't think I am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

Anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the Pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. But all these kids know sign language, and I thought that was pretty damn cool. So I start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! Suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! She can call me mom and my husband, dad! Holy shit! Thanks Pinterest moms! I take back all the shit I talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

Well today with my husband out of town, I didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants I decided to go out for a quick dinner. The kid loves French fries and so do I. So we hit the local burger joint and I order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. The server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and I set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. So of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". And every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. Ok, whatever. 

Well I notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. I'm like okay, I did like 4 quick google searches, maybe I botched some of what I taught her. It's fine. But then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iPhone down with a message typed out for me to read. It says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

I'm like... wait... what? So she continues to show me that I have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since I am her mom. I can only imagine what the Pinterest moms would've done had I shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

TL;DR ASL is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

ETA: Thanks, everyone! I'm glad you all enjoyed this post. Please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that I was trying to teach my child proper ASL. They were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as ASL. They just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

Also please note that I literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. I have no idea how close they were to the real signs. Additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. She speaks English well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. We were always sure to say the words while signing them. She now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that I decided to share with you all. I'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". You can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",tifu

[Colorado] Guy threatening my family to my mother,"My mom asked me to get a bunch of viruses off her computer today. Found a folder titled, ""Sins of my Children"" and opened it. Found weird poetry and IRC chat logs of some guy offering to kill my wife and me. They seemed to be in some sort of online relationship. Half the chat was sappy love promises, the rest was her telling him about all the ways my brother and I have wronged her. Nearly everything was a lie. The accusations were insane. She gave this guy my address and a shit ton of personally identifying information about me and my wife. And he said he knew people who could ""take care of us"" for her, to show his devotion or shit. She agreed and there was a conversation negotiating prices. 

I understand he's probably bullshitting but the whole thing was deranged. The dude also doesn't live too far from me either based on what he said, a few hours drive. My wife is pregnant (this was one of my many ""sins"" apparently having my own child means I'm replacing my mom) and I am not risking of some psycho who knows my address showing up here if I can help it.

Is this serious enough to be reportable to cops or would they laugh me out of the station? Does it constitute a threat legally speaking? I took screenshots that I emailed to myself, so I have evidence if so. How should I deal with this?

TIFU by going on a Tinder date,"The obligatory this actually happened last Friday. I met up with a guy from Tinder (we'll call him Tim) for a date. It was actually going pretty well, we had stuff in common and didn't seem as awkward as most dates. Drinks start flowing, I'm having a good time, and the night moves on. 

After we got to the 3rd bar he looks at his phone and says ""hey, my best friend (we'll call him Steve) is in the area, would you mind if he stopped by for a drink?"" I was having a good time and didn't care so told him to invite him over. 

We proceed to another bar where Steve is going to meet us. I then kick Tims ass at Street Fighter and am still having fun, oblivious to what's about to happen. 

In walks Steve and the world stops. I immediately recognize the guy. How you ask? Because a week prior I was talking with Steve on Tinder, we made tentative plans to meet. When the day came and he contacted me to confirm plans, I just wasn't feeling it. So I was a shitty asshole of a human and blew him off by not responding and just deleted him. Trust me, I know it was an awful thing to do and Karma chewed my ass right back...

So Steve walks up to us and it's awkward as fuck. Tim introduces us and instead of saying the usual ""hi"" he starts laughing and shaking his head. He says he needs a drink and walks off. I immediately tell Tim what happened and take credit for being a shit stain for doing that to Steve. Tim just awkwardly laughed and didn't say much. 

Steve returns, it continues to be weird as fuck (I deserve it). I try to cut the tension and just straight up apologized to Steve for being a douche bag. Tension got worse. Nobody was saying anything. I had to get out of that situation for a bit so I announce that I'm gonna use the ladies room. It's notoriously nasty in this joint so I leave my jacket behind. 

When I came back both Tim and Steve were gone, and they took my jacket with them. Thankfully bartender saw the whole thing so didn't charge me for their tab, I tipped him well to start being a decent human. 

TLDR: I blew off a tinder date, then a week later ran into him whilst on a date with his best friend. Got ditched and my jacket was stolen. 

Edited for further clarification: 1) To clarify for several people and the haters. I didn't stand Steve up or leave him waiting anywhere, we had nothing solidly planned and I just didn't respond when he messaged to make plans. I feel like I took the higher road and not only told Tim about it, but I straight up apologized to Steve as well. 2) I still highly doubt the whole thing was planned. Why would Tim spend several hours with me having what seemed to be a decent time, just to mess with me and ditch me? He honestly seemed like a good guy and up until the ditching and jacket incident. 

Update 1: I called Tim and he HASN'T blocked my number. I left a friendly enough voicemail so will update if he calls back. 

Update 2: Thanks for the gold!!! :) Was honestly not expecting this to blow up the way it has. All of these comments add to the hilarity of this whole story, even the shitty ones. You guys crack me up! Still no word from Tim though. 

Update 3: This story just keeps getting better and better. Tim called me back! Super busy at work right now so I'll update details when I have time later today. 

Update 4: Sorry all, work was just insane today.. So Tim called me back! Here's what he told me: when I went to the bathroom Steve flipped out, grabbed my jacket and left out the backdoor.  Tim goes to follow Steve to calm him down and to get my jacket back because (obviously) it's just stupid he took it.  Steve starts running, so does Tim, they get into a bit of a live Street Fighter match and Tim's phone gets busted during this process.  By the time he returned to the bar I was gone and he couldn't get ahold of me until today when he got his phone back.  He also paid the bar tab.  Apparently the bartender was dying when he heard this whole story and was prepared to tell me what happened to Tim, but I never went back to that bar.  He has the famous jacket and we have a second date planned tomorrow to make up for the craziness of his friend and to return my jacket.  He says Steve is cool with everything now, was just way too drunk, and he way over reacts to everything anyways.  He definitely wants to hang out again, but I've learned my lesson and will be more communicative about actually making plans with people in the future.
TLDR: Steve is in fact a douchebag, Tim is a hero, I got my jacket back.  Bro's before hoe's my ass.",tifu

TIFU by having shower sex and almost killing myself,"In classic TIFU fashion, this happened 3 years ago:


It was my junior year of college and I found myself having regular coitus sessions with a woman. A human woman! Things were going great, but we decided to make things more interesting.


In my mind, shower sex had always seemed like a good idea. I had seen videos of it and heard stories about it, so when she suggested we try it out I agreed instantly. I really should have done my research.


At this point in my life, I had my own bathroom that had abysmal ventilation, but it had a shower/bathtub combo so we decided on using my place. I guess I conflated the ideas of sex being hot and temperature being hot because I cranked the shit out of the heat in that shower.


2 minutes later and we've begun the act. The act itself was rather unpleasant. The plopping and squishing noises of our wet bodies were completely unexpected. As a tall dude, I have to like semi-squat behind her. After about 5 minutes or so we get into a groove and I can feel myself nearing completion, but I also start feeling very weird. Between the squishing, the squatting, the thrusting, and making sure nobody gets waterboarded accidentally, I realized I hadn't taken a breath in about 45 seconds. This sexual experience had been an entirely anaerobic experience for me and I just realized.


As the bald man is about to cry his first tears, I desperately gasp for air. The steam in the bathroom is now a dense fog that contains little usable oxygen. Immediately, every muscle in my body simultaneously cramps. I fall out of the shower while decorating a wall with a Peter-Parker-esque web. At this point, my muscles are too fucked to even attempt to stand, so I begin a last ditch effort to crawl to open that door while still cumming. My partner is visibly horrified and shrieking as she watches my wet, doughy, pale ass slide like a slug to the door, leaving a trail of water and my own ejaculate.


After I managed to get out of the bathroom, I lost consciousness about 4 feet from the door. When I woke up, the girl was dressed and ready to leave. In my exhaustion, I mumbled a goodbye to her and waved as she departed. I always think about that goodbye from her perspective; a giant half-conscious naked man lying on the floor covered in his own semen waving goodbye. She might still be in therapy working out that image.


Tl;dr had shower sex and cramped up/passed out from a lack of oxygen, having to crawl out of the bathroom while still ejaculating, 6/10 experience overall",tifu

AITA for telling my mom that I caught my aunt and my adult brother having sex (and getting her kicked out)?,"I'll just get right into it. My aunt had been staying with us for 4 months. We never saw her  often because she lives on the other side of the country but my mom took her in after a horrible divorce. I immediately noticed that she was acting a little weird/loony but I attributed that to having gone through so much with her husband. My brother (who's 20) seemed to make a lot of effort to spend time with her but I didn't think anything of it because why would I? 

I came back early from work one day and heard really loud noises. The more I listened, the more I realized someone was definitely having sex. I instantly thought that my brother brought a girl home or something because the noises came from his room. His door was somewhat open so I rushed past it to get to mine only to be stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the back of my aunt, clear as day. I instantly felt like throwing up and managed to get to my room without them seeing me. In there I pretty much collapsed, contemplated my existence and the utter fucked-up-ness of my family (I knew it was fucked up, but not like this) Then I just felt scared. I didn't know what it meant. I knew it was wrong, very wrong, but not what to do about it. I was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. This what I meant by fucked up family). I just kind of panicked. 

So the next day, my aunt went to work and I knew she would be there late. When my mom came home, I instantly told her I needed to tell her something. I sat her down and told her exactly what I saw and heard and she went BALLISTIC. She stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. My aunt never came back. 

My brother is now very upset with me. He told me that they're two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they weren't hurting anybody and that it was never my business. He has all of his stuff packed and he's planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. My mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. They all HATE my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. This made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. 

Now I'm stuck wondering if I made an asshole move by ""telling"" on them. My family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.

EDIT/UPDATE: My brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. I tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldn't let her deal with this on her own. He also said he's been in love with her since he was a kid. Before he left, he told me that he isn't angry with me and apologized for being upset before.

AITA for asking my friends if their daughter has blue eyes?,"One of my cousins, Peter just had a baby with his girlfriend a few days ago. Peter and all his siblings all have very stunning blue eyes which they inherited from their mom. They always get compliments on their eyes. Peter and his girlfriend posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born on the 23rd and I decided to give Peter a call to congratulate him. When I called he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. I congratulated both of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they'll be great parents. I then asked Peter ""did she get your blue eyes?"" (in the picture they posted on social media the eye color wasn't visible) Peter and his girlfriend's tone completely changed and his girlfriend said ""Jesus, why are you so concerned by the eye color of my baby. It's fucking weird"" I was pretty taken aback by her reaction. I didn't mean anything by it I was just curious. I thought this was a normal conversation point. I tried to say I didn't mean to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really busy and they had to go.

I told my mom what happened and she said that Peter's girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought I was insulting her baby but that I didn't say anything wrong. However my sister said I was out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there were racial implications since Peter's girlfriend is biracial (half Jamaican). This didn't make sense to me. I never said not having blue eyes was bad. My eyes are brown! I was just curious!

Edit: Yeah ok Peter called our family to thank my mom for a gift and we talked a bit. I apologized again for offending them. He accepted my apology but said his girlfriend is was really mad at me but she'll probably calm down in a day or 2. he explained that they've been harassed by family members from even before the baby was born about whether the baby would have blue eyes and his girlfriend is very annoyed by people's fixation on eye color and feels there's some racist undertone to it since blue eyes are ""white features"" and that people think her baby would be any less beautiful if it didn't have blue eyes.

Ex Wife Trying To File Claim After Divorce,"Hello. My ex wife is trying to file claims against me after our divorce. So basically we had a condominium that I transferred over to her with no fault. A month later we finalized our uncontested divorce (In Virginia). So she went two months without paying the condominium fees because she assumed I would pay. I'm military and received extra money for bah and cola during separation and provided extra differential to her during proceedings. She claims she had a lawyer friend who specializes in military divorces but the divorce is final. I informed my next in line who told me that anything she tried would not be handled by the military since it's a civil matter and she signed the divorce papers. We had no written agreements during separation for payments only verbal exchanges and as I said the divorce was finalized uncontested. Does she have any legal claims against me? Or did she give up all those rights when she signed all finalized papers?  Thanks in advance.

Edit: Thanks all for your answers and help. I am going to take my decree to an attorney here in Florida next week just to look over it and see what I can do to counter her if she files a claim.

I'm recently single living with my sister and her family. My mom and I talk every day, but I don't tell her about the dumb shit I do. Anyway, I've been spending time with this guy that's definitely bad news. He works a ton, but he's a goddamn mess. 

My mom knows that I've been ""seeing"" this guy because my sister told her. She interrogated me about it tonight. I tried to say good things about him because otherwise it reflects badly on me...

Anyway, dude and I are hanging out tonight drinking whiskey and beer. We have sex. I get off, but he doesn't. I decide to go down on him... and he fucking falls asleep. In. The. Middle. 

Obviously, I stop and text my best friend about it. Except I text my mom and say ""he fell asleep with his dick IN MY MOUTH"" 😩😩😩😩 Immediately text her back saying that wasn't meant for her... 

So, she's going to wake up tomorrow, to go to YOGA, and see how I had some drunk dudes dick in my mouth who passed out. I don't know if she'll be more upset that I text her in the middle of the night or that I'm apparently so shitty that dudes pass out on me.... 

TL;DR told my mom that a dude passed out with his dick in my mouth


Edit: apparently it's not okay to make a joke about a dude working hard and having whiskey dick 🙄 just to be clear, I don't hold any of this against him. I know he'll think it's just as funny as I do.

Edit #2: I sent my mom another text saying ""Sorry! What is my life?!"". She replied ""Figured. I was wondering the same thing...""",tifu
WIBTA for reporting my Uber driver for picking up other passengers on the way,"For context, I had opted NOT to use the ""Uber pool"" option. When I got in the Uber, the driver (who I must stress was VERY friendly and personable) asked if it would be okay if he picked up another passenger on the way to my destination, ""to kill two birds with one stone"". I tentatively obliged because I felt awkward, and I assumed he had the option to change the pricing from regular to pool in order to pick the other passenger up. Instead, he pulled up Lyft, and picked up two other passengers. They were also not told they would be sharing the ride, as they were both visibly surprised and had to have the situation explained to them. 
From there, the experience was fine. We were going the same way, the other passengers were no issue, and the driver truly was pleasant and attempted to make conversation amongst us. 
However, I checked, and I was still charged the full amount, as if I had ridden solo. The difference is almost $6, which isn't a ton of money but it's the principle more than anything. 
I am strongly considering reporting him, but am feeling super guilty. I know a lot of people who use Uber driving to work their asses off and who really need the money, the guy is just trying to make a living. That being said, it feels really unprofessional to charge people and pool them regardless. 
TLDR: WIBTA if I reported an otherwise nice Uber driver for charging me full price but pooling me with two other passengers anyways",AmItheAsshole
"AITA for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?","My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, I'll be happy to contribute the money. But it's not just a free handout.

She's got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don't want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she's staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",AmItheAsshole
My [33 M] wife [32 F] hit me at a family BBQ. Everybody laughed.,"I don't think I'd ever felt more pathetic than I did at that moment. We'd gotten into an argument. She wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). I'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. I didn't think I should drive. My sister was also urging me to go. She was standing right there when my wife hit me. It was square across the face. I'd just told her there was no way I was driving since I'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. My wife called me an asshole... Then wham...

My sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. Everyone around us laughed. Maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but I can't say for certain. Nevertheless I felt humiliated.

The thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. It started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). It was infrequent at first. She was always super apologetic. Over time it escalated. She started throwing and smashing things. Screaming. Berating me. Hitting, kicking, and punching me. I don't even know how it got so bad. It just is and I feel trapped. Who in their right minds would believe me? Who would ever think she was capable of this? Sometimes I feel like I'm hallucinating it all and I'm just losing my mind. She was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? I don't even know.

Now people do know and it doesn't even matter. It's funny. I'm funny. It's so fucking funny. Look at him getting hit by his wife. So damn funny.

I want to disappear. I would if it weren't for my kids.

I don't even know what my question is. I don't really have one.

Is even possible to come back from this? I wish I could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

"New York- Mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while I was babysitting 4 year old step sister","Hi folks

I'm a 21 year old college student. My parents separated soon after I was born, and my my mom raised me alone until I was 15. She met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister Eliza. She's grown up with me, and I often baby sit for her for short periods of time. I live with a roomate in apartments owned by the College

Late last week, my stepfather's mom died. He's Polish, so my mom and he left for Poland leaving me to babysit Eliza for a week. Yesterday, I got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in Poland. I've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

I have no idea what to do. My biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. My mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the USA that I am aware of. I'm studying Political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but I have no job and no salary. 

Eliza has no family other than me that I can turn to. I'm not ready to take of a child, but I also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and I've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. But we also look very different- my dad is Jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. So I'm a tall, mixed race dude while Eliza is a small blonde girl (I bring this up because I was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

So what do I do? I'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and I haven't even told Eliza yet. It just hit me that we're now alone, and I now have to step up to the plate and take care of Eliza. I have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

Parents whose children die because of a preventable disease because they chose not to vaccinate should be charged with neglect and 3rd degree murder,"Title says it all. Personally I think that the anti-vaccination movement is absurd and it sickens me that people will voluntarily let their child catch a life threatening disease that could easily have been avoided by getting a vaccination. Letting your child die to something preventable because you chose not to do it should be punished severely, and there should be lengthy jail terms and heavy fines to anyone that lets it happen. I know it seems pretty extreme, but it fits right under neglect, and letting someone die because of your actions (not to mention letting a child die) should, in this case, be treated as murder.

EDIT: I didn't make this clear enough above and I apologize for that but my ""end goal"" with this isn't actually to incarcerate people who have had their child die, but to tack on something more to the threat of what happens as if the movement has existed as long as it has and continues, the children who have died aren't enough to get people to realize what they're doing.

MN: Someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.,"This past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard. They had been there for a bit when I let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously I wouldn't have done so). My dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). I coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck.

Last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. I can only imagine where he will be going with this.

I know I need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now I'm not even sure where to start. Am I liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard? Since our property is a notable size we have no tresspassing signs around but they're of course not visible from the air.

So after I went home yesterday, I cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

I called her, she accepted my call and said ""What?"" I told her ""I'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

I texted her, ""I need the copy of my house keys back, I'm breaking up with you.""

She didn't respond. I got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

I looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. So I texted her ""Where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

I drove back home and I noticed her car parked next to my house, I carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there I see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my iPad...) that's when I tell her ""What are you doing?"" 

She tells me, ""I'm taking back what's mine."" That's when I tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""Get off me."" She started kicking me and ran out the house.

I tell her to give my shit back or I will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so I whip out my phone and dial the cops.

She drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my iPad.

Cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and I told them what happened and I tell them the location of her house.

They sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

The cops start asking me questions like ""Is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later I got my stuff back.
She has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

Now I'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick.

"UPDATE: My babies and I escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3AM last night... I'm scared, my kids are confused... I don't even know how I feel right now but nothing seems real.","Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av968z/my_babies_and_i_escaped_to_a_shelter_for_victims/

Thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. I was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

A little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

The dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. My kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". He asks for daddy nightly saying ""I just want daddy be happy. I just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but I just tell him I love him and hold him when he is hurting. I realized even being here I am happier than I ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. I don't feel like I'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

The shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. My 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and I've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

They have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. The attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. They are also filing a long term protective order. 

We have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

I will be starting work again next week. My HR manager contacted the store up where I am now to have me transferred because of the situation. I am so thankful the company I work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though I've had to take the last few weeks off while I get things in order. 

The shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on Wednesday for BOTH children while I start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. The daycare facility is wonderful and I'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while I start work again! 

Since I am able to start work again too I was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

I was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. I was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

A detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while I handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. The detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. So, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a Class C family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when I was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a Class A and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

He has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying I kidnapped the children and also filed a false CPS report. I handed over all evidence to CPS as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. He DID text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but I didn't respond. If I even let him see the children until things get worked out I risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

His mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to Florida so I would never see them again.... 

So, things are moving along. It has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but I've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. I feel like things are pulling together even faster than I imagined. It's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes I just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

I hope one day I can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources ARE available. It's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what I ever could have imagined and hoped for and I will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

The amount of PM's and responses have been incredible. Many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. Both the negative and positive comments have helped me and I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

Yesterday I was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. The only person I responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. I didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

During the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as I need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). Aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity I dont mind answering them.

I also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). In a month? when i am back from vacation?

Once again thanks for all the support

EDIT 2: My friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that I have to pick it up by myself. I dont know why she is still acting like this. I am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.",relationship_advice

My (28F) girlfriend (26F) didn't stop when I used the safe word.,"My girlfriend, Sam, have been together for 8 months now and I are into BDSM. Not to an extreme of the lifestyle but we like doing some BDSM type stuff in the bedroom from time to time. We've been doing it a lot as of late and it's become quite fun. We're really getting into it.

That being said I'm more a submissive type and I don't want to get into too deep of what we were doing. But let's just say I was tied up and there was a safe word we had. I started to feel uncomfortable and didn't enjoy what we were doing. 

I yelled out the safe word 3 times and Sam didn't stop. I started to yell and cry. She didn't stop until tears were visible.

We didn't talk about it. She went to shower then go to bed. I left. I'm at my place right now, and I feel so helpless. I don't know if I want to break up with Sam. She's a great woman but when she didn't stop it hurt me. I feel so violated. 

What should I do?

My husband married my co-wife because we were told I was infertile. I love his second wife. Now I'm pregnant. What do I do?,"I'm from a culture where it's okay for husband to have up to four wives although it is not often done. When my husband and I got married he said he only ever wanted me. We got along great and we fell in love soon after the wedding. (Arranged marriage). 

After trying for a child for a long time we found out I had diminished ovarian reserve and we would not get pregnant and IVF would most likely be futile round after futile round. 

I was absolutely heartbroken I could not bare his children for him. He was more okay with this than I was. We discussed and reached the decision together for him to have a second wife as long as she would be a good fit for his life. For example, would she be okay living together with first wife (me)? Our religion says a second wife has rights to her own place. 

We didn't rush into anything and I actually found a girl who was interested and I introduced her to my husband. They got on well and I didn't have very much jealousy and things are great. 

They got married and we all live together. While there were ups and downs (just like my husband and I when we first got married) eventually things were great. We all lived together and our husband treats us both excellently. She soon became pregnant and we were all excited. Her pregnancy was hard but I looked after her. When baby came I was also a mother and love this child like my own. We all get on so well. 

She now has a 4 and 2 year old to my husband. When we discussed our feelings once. She said she feels secure because she has been able to give our husband children. And I feel secure because I was his first wife. 

However. I just found out I'm 8 weeks pregnant. I never expected this to happen. And really I am so happy. But I'm terrified how this is going to change our relationship dynamic. I am scared she will be hurt or our house hold might be split into two households and then I only get my husband 50% of the time with a newborn.

I briefly even thought of suicide or abortion but I'd never ever do this. Ive just really been in dark place and being really emotional. I really don't want to hurt my co wife though. I don't want to ruin our family dynamic. I also feel pressure of time. I haven't told my husband or my cowife.

Please I really need advice.

EDIT: thank you to everyone who has taken the time to reply.

[UPDATE] Wife (31F) and I(34M) are broken and Im thinking of divorce.,"Someone messaged me asking for a followup on my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/anwmeo/wife_31f_and_i34m_are_broken_and_im_thinking_of/) . Ive started , stopped and rewritten this post a few times over several days already to so if it seems a little incoherent, sorry. Lots went on but Ill keep it short as possible.

&#x200B;

That Saturday after my original post I tried again to talk to her about what I felt was missing in our relationship. This did not go well. The next Staurday I went out and rented an apartment with a lease starting March 1st. I  went back home and told her I would be moving out. I said I did not know what was going on with her and since she did not want to do anything about it  I wanted a divorce. I loved her but I couldnt live like a hostage anymore. She got really quiet and then started sobbing and telling me that I was cruel and selfish and that my focus on sex was the issue and that I should go to counseling for that (again).  I was hoping that she would have said somehting else but since she didnt I just started packing a few things for work. She asked me where I was going and told her I would be staying at my parents for the next few weeks until my lease started.

&#x200B;

As soon as I told her I  would be staying at my parents she got really quiet and asked me if Id told my parents yet. Sirens started going off in my head immediately. I said that I had not (this was lie). Then she got quiet for about 5 minutes and right when I was about to walk out the door she asked me not to leave. She wanted to talk.  And then she told me something I didnt want to hear.

&#x200B;

She'd cheated on me with a guy in her class last year. And got an STD.  Nothing fatal but not the kind you can get rid of . She told me that it only happened one time but I am sure that is not true. I was numb. ( One of my female friends told me that wife cheating was a possibility but I didnt believe it) .  I didn't say anything while wife talked. MOstly because my mind was reeling but also because I didnt really have anything to say. I realize now that I had said everything I had to say over the course of the previous year and now I had nothing.  After she finished talking  I just told her ok. I was numb. And I left the house with her in it and went to my parents house about 2 hours away. I told her I would be back but have not been back to the house or seen her since.

&#x200B;

I got to my parents house and told them everything . They told me they could tell something was wrong for a few months and that they were sorry.I had planned to go back to the house but my mother told me that if I was moving forward with divorce that I should not go . So my mother and father went and got a few personal items for me. Everything else I left. I also contacted a lawyer and told him to contact wife to start the divorce.

&#x200B;

Wife has called me on cell and at work a few times and even emailed me  but I didn't read it.  She also  had one of her friends call me and tell me to please talk to my wife and that she is very sorry but as soon as I realized it was a friend of hers I hung up.  I have  two weeks off coming up in April and I plan to go to Vegas with a buddy.  My parents and friends have been very supportive and I honestly feel better than I have felt in a long time.

&#x200B;

I never thought I would get divorced. And that first week I felt like a failure because I knew my marriage was over. But my father told me something that I have said to myself over and over. ""Someone else doing the wrong thing makes them the failure. Not you . ""

&#x200B;

I hung out this weekend with a girl from my job who Ive always gotten along with . She saw me at work last week without my ring and asked me what happened. I told her that my wife and I were divorcing. She gave me a hug in the office and that hug felt like the best thing in the world. After work this weekend we  went out for a few drinks and just hung out and had fun and ended up back at my place.  Im not ready for nor do I want a relationship obviously but it felt so good to be in a bed with a woman where it felt so relaxed and accepting. I felt completely at ease.  I know the divorce is going to be tough but this weekend even after all thats happened I feel like it will be worth it.

LPT: Increase your offers to help a friend who is mourning about 6 weeks after the death of their loved one. This is the point at which the initial wave of support has died off and people are particularly vulnerable.,"A wise leader of a church taught me this.  He had helped many through the grieving process. When a close friend of mine lost a loved one tragically, I asked him what I should do to help them.  He taught me that often, the hardest time for people while grieving was when the initial wave of condolences had gone away and people don't really know/forget to offer help anymore.  Meanwhile, the person grieving has to start trying to transition back to ""normal life"" and routines and they are often left more lonely than ever. **(Note , I have noticed that this jump in time to support can be much sooner that six weeks, sometimes it is a soon as a few day).


To be clear, offering to help initially is great and important as well but consistent continued support is priceless. 

Edit:  I wish I could **hug** all of you through the screen.  So many of you have shared your advice about your personal struggles with loved ones.... Thank-you.

TIFU by having to give my 5yo son $100 for beating my high score.,"Happened a couple of hours ago. 

I've been playing this game I stumbled across recently. 
You know the ones, free, highly addictive, but jam packed full of advertising. 

Anyhows, I thought I was an absolute champion when I scored 34 earlier today. The first thing I thought of was boasting to my boy when he came home from pre school since he likes the game too. I was all in his face like ""I'm the Game King"".  

I figured my 5 year old had no chance of beating my score as the highest I'd seen him get was a measly 21 - and he fluked it, so I told him I'd give him $100 (Australian) if he could beat my score. 

Never underestimate the power of a huge financial incentive. I heard uncontrollable laughter about 15 minutes later. Sure enough the little guy had cracked my high score. 38. 

Parents of Reddit will understand you can't go back on your word with children. His piggy bank just got $100 fatter and I've had to put up with ""I'm pretty good aren't I Dad?!""  :)

TL;DR Got cocky, told my boy I'd give him a $100 if he beat my high score. He did. Never underestimate children and the power of a financial incentive. 


Edit: understandably my original post was removed by mod. Made some small changes so it didn't appear that I was an advertising genius.

&#x200B;

Throwaway, first time poster, English not first language, tldr at the end, blabla... I am 21

We've been together for 4 years. At the beginning, like all teenagers do, we also fooled around, she was genuinely turned on and wanted to do stuff but we never got to penetration. We were both virgin and to her, virginity was always the best thing she can give me, it's ""the only thing she can give only to me in the whole life"" and to be honest, that's why I\[21m\] didn't push for it at all and wanted the take her pace.

Around 2-2.5 years ago, things started to cool down. She no longer wanted to do it(referring to touching and oral) as often and a year ago she started pushing away even though I would ask twice a month when I was sexually frustrated. I really loved her, and I still do, and I think she is smart, intelligent and beautiful and that's why that wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Two weeks after our 4 years mark, she said she felt trapped and that she wanted to take a little break from our relationship. I was crushed because I didn't see this coming at all. Her ""trapped"" definition was that she felt bad going to concerts and doing stuff without inviting me, and to be honest, I always encouraged her to go with her girlfriends and have fun, I have a feeling she trapped herself? I think she just wanted to take a break and couldn't come up with a better reason or the real reason was offending to me or she just lost attraction although she denied it. We talked it through and we decided that we will take a break and she will call me once the break is over. She was supposed to move in with me in may.

It took a toll on me, I performed bad at my work and I was distant from my family, I was crushed and I hoped she would come back and that we would cry together, agree it was a mistake and move on.

Well, after around 3 weeks, she messaged me and said she wanted to talk. I was so excited and I invited her to my house. When she arrived, shortly after, she basically broke down crying, saying she met a guy\[23m\] 2 weeks ago and that after 3 days they slept together. She said she tried to connect with him but it wasn't nearly as fun as with me and that she wasn't sure why she wanted to take a break from me in the first place. Now, I consider myself 7-8/10, I am tall and work out semi-regularly. She assured me that it wasn't my looks. She said she wanted us to be together again and that she would do anything to earn back my trust and make me happy. The guy she slept with was 10/10 and a lot of muscle, although I didn't know him or anything about him.

This happened yesterday. I am broken. I couldn't come up with words and just said it's gonna be okay and later politely asked her to leave so I have time and space to think. I can't help it but feel like a backup plan, she sacrificed our 4 years together and basically made me a fool for waiting for sex and thinking that I am something special for her. It bothers me so much that she was ready to fuck some guy, less than a week after we broke up. Even if we get back together, am I supposed to have sex with her now or what...

I will provide more information if needed, but I am really struggling for some advice on what to do.

TIFU being on my period and getting drunk,"So like the title said I fucked up (it was after midnight so technicly today) by having my period and getting drunk.
If your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, It will fuck up your life.

My son's birthday was yesterday, so I've been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don't break anything/eachother. Somewhere around noon I noticed my period got heavy and I put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.

Around 7 o'clock everyone left except my husband's best friend, I put the kids to bed and started to relax. I've had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed I treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and I got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos I hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). 
Around 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. And since I've got no gamer friends I had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. Around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. 

This is where my FU begins.

I was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let's face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). But then I realised I still had my tampon in, so I had to get it out (also because it's dangerous to have it in for as long as I unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). 

I went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when I realised I couldnt ""find"" it, or the string. After some fumbling around I could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. I spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and I couldnt get a good grip at it. 
I was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of The Lost Tampon wasn't the kind of sexytime I had in mind. 

I decided to call the HAP (I live in Holland, here we dont go to the ER for everything, we go to out ""homedoctor"" for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. But outside working hours there is the HAP which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). 

Trying to sound kinda sober I explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, If I didnt get the fucker out in an hour, I had to come by and they would extract it. If I would wait till morning I would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  That would mean I would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for I fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.
I wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because Im the hilarious one in our relationship, and I wasn't ready to hear ""yo pussy so big, tampons get lost"" jokes for the rest of my life). 

So before this moment I was a woman on a mission, now I was Frodo trying to get this tampon out of Sauromons grip. 

Nurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. 

So here I was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of Erebor. Still not getting good enough grip. So I take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. Guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. 

Decide to lean agains the wall squatting, and I finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. I AM NOT LETTING GO NOW! While I pull gentely I push like I'm in labour, and what do you think, I finally pulled the fucker out! 

I felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here I come! 

Before I leave to shower I decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why It took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.

I look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then I scream.. I would't have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from Alien..
...Then the realisation kicked in.. 

I.PULLED.OUT.MY.FUCKING.IUD...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. OMG I pulled out my IUD.. It was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..

If you think my FU ends here.. think again.. Keep in mind it's around 2/3 o'clock now.

In my panic I decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn't nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). My father answers the phone all sleepy, and I ask for my mom. ""Well sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, I can help you, no need to wake your mother."" Okay... 

IWantedToHaveSexytimeWithHusbandButImHavingMyPeriodITouhgtICouldntGetMyTamponOutButNowIPulledOutMyIUD... HELPPPPP!!!!  ""......""  Daddy?  ""......"" ""M. WAKE UP YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU!"" 

So now I explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said I needed to call the HAP again. 
So I did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. She consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if Im oké.. 

""Ma'am, are you shivvering?"" Yes I am. ""Can you decribe how bad?"" Well I was in the shower, and now I'm standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so I'm getting kinda cold. 
""Okay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma'am?"" Yes I am dizzy. ""Can you decribe how dizzy?"" Well I drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy I am.(Muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) ""Well I guess thats okay also than. Are you bleeding down there?"" Yes I am. ""Okay sweety how bad is it?"" Well I'm heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. ""Oh yeah, I forgot, so that is normal also than."" 

She suggested to go to bed, and if I felt worse I could stop by, the fact that I pulled out my IUD wasn't so different than when I would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that ""would have happend more gently"" (no shit Sherlock).

There is still the mistery of The Lost Tampon.. I think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but I have no clue.

So for not letting go drunken sexytime, I'm now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till I get a new IUD. And because I didn't want to hear ""Yo pussy so big"" jokes, now I'm gonna hear ""Remember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your IUD"" jokes forever. Not to mention my parents now know I like drunken sexytime.. So yeah I fucked up today..

TL;DR

Today I fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. Mistake my IUD for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them I fucked up because I wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. I did not get sexytime, nor will I get it for a few weeks.

Edit: Wow this really blew up after I went to sleep! Glad to see my drunken efforts brought so much laughter! And its kinda nice to see al the shocked reactions, makes me feel a little less dumb for calling for my mommy in the middle of the night! 

Some aditional info as requested:

- A IUD is a form of birtcontrol, its like a 2cm big T shaped metal thingy which is placed in your uterus, on the bottom of the T is a little string that sticks out your uterus alllll the way up your vagina, so that they can remove it. 

- No thank God it didnt hurt (dont know if that was the wine of the fact that I gave birth to to kids)

- Yes my funzone is (apart from some trust issues) okay!

- Yes I'm fullt aware now that I didnt have to tell my parents I wanted sexytime, but drunken and horrified me couldnt care less at that moment.

- I'm 32 year old grown up mother of 2, and yes I called for my mommy

- I could have asked husband to remove The Lost Tampon, but I figured after that sexytime wouldnt be an option for him, and since that was the goal I didnt ask him. (Thank God, cause this would have scarred him for life!)

- As for The Lost Tampon.. I have no idea, I must have drunkenly removed it earlier.. else it still dwells in the depths of Erebor

Thanks for al the support, shocked reactions, compliments, laughter, silver, gold AND platinum! This made my FU a little less embarrasing!",tifu
"TIFU by having a scary dream, resulting in the police being called for a missing person (me)","This is probably my sisters favourite memory from us growing up. This all happened when I was about 4 or 5 years old. I had had a scary dream and was having trouble sleeping, so I went to my parents room and crawled into my mums bed without her noticing, and fell asleep.

When my mum woke up, she flicked her blanket off, covering me, and went downstairs to the kitchen. After a while of me not surfacing, she went looking for me in my room and couldn't find me. Panicked, she starts searching every room in the house, and turning up empty each time. No sign of me in the garden, and no sign of me out the front. The whole family have now started running around checking every possible spot a tiny person could get into, getting progressively more and more worried by the second.

My mum's room was pretty bare, and I guess the heaped blanket on top of me showed no infant outline, and so they kept missing my comatose body.

After a few hours, the police were round, filling in a missing person's report and taking all possible identifying details. I wish I could remember everyone's reactions when sleepy u/roodeeMental walks downstairs into a room full of super stressed out and concerned people, but my sister tells me it was one of the best things she ever got to witness. My mother was a flood of every emotion, and the police were glad I was fine. I was confused, but not nearly as much as everyone else. That day my family learnt how bad they are at hide and seek, and what I am able to sleep through. 

Tl;dr: fell asleep in my mums bed unbeknownst to her. When she woke up, the blanket covered me, and she couldn't find me, resulting in the police being called. ",tifu

TIFU by sitting on my Right Testicle and blacking out because of the pain.,"TL:DR ls is the title.


It was a average summer vacation day, I woke up late ate breakfast, blah blah blah, then I made a Nutella Milkshake (which is actually REALLY tasty) and went to sit down on the living room chair. That's when disaster struck. I don't really know how and why, probably the angle I was about to sit on, but I sat on my right testicle. The pain was insane. I jumped off the chair and started walking out, in pain. Suddenly I had black spot clouding my eyes and the next thing I know, I'm on the floor with my milkshake over me and my mom screaming. I blacked out for a few seconds and honestly it was the scariest few seconds of my life. I had a pounding headache but at least my right testicle didn't hurt anymore! I'm fine now, and my mother calmed down before calling the ambulance. That was the first time I ever blacked out and I honestly was really scared.




Edit: a lot of people are asking for the Nutella Milkshake so:
You must heat your Nutella just enough so it becomes more of a liquid. Then you ad it to warm milk and shake (or use a blender) you can add chocolate ice cream for more flavor btw!


Edit2: Everyone worrying about my testicle, please don't. I didn't sit on it that bad and I don't think I fainted just from the pain from that, I don't drink water a lot so it was probably also from dehydration. If there as something wrong it wouldn't stop hurting 40 seconds later.

My dad destroyed my girlfriend's camera and now I'm worried about our relationship.,"My girlfriend is a YouTube vlogger and it has undeniably been the source of some tension in our relationship, but we've been able to talk things out and make things work. My dad has especially been uptight about her being around with her camera and things really boiled over this past week when me, my girlfriend, and my family went on vacation to our Summer beach house in Lake Tahoe.

The first couple of days were fine. My girlfriend didn't vlog when my dad was around and she was being considerate of how he feels about the camera being on, but she still vlogged an awful lot when it was just me and her and sometimes my mom. But one day while we were all getting ready to go out to eat, I was in the bathroom. I won't go into too much detail, but let's just say that I wasn't having the most smooth bowel movement at the time. I was on the toilet for a while and my girlfriend was urging me to hurry up. It then reached a point where she was silent, save for some stifled giggling. I figured that she was most likely filming and trying to get some audio of me taking a dump, so I started yelling at her to turn the camera off. She claimed that she wasn't filming, but she was laughing while saying it and that confirmed to me that she was filming.

I was honestly really annoyed and disgusted that she wanted to film me taking a shit, so I finished my business, burst out the door, and started yelling at her to give me the camera. She ran away and she must've thought that I was joking because she was laughing the whole time, but I was really pissed off and I wanted to take her camera. I was chasing her around the house and things went really bad when she sharply turned a corner and ran into my dad, spilling his soda all over him in the process. He got pissed off, yelled about the vlogging, and then snatches the camera out of my girlfriend's hands. And what does he do? He goes outside with it and chucks it into the lake. My girlfriend was screaming and digging around in the water to find her camera and then my dad starts yelling about cutting the trip short and going home the next day.

AITA For giving my wife a baby hamster after she miscarried two months ago?,"Me and my wife have been married for almost two years. Its been our dream to have a big family. She is 21, i am 24. We are both healthy and have an active sex life, but she has a heart shaped uterus and has miscarried twice,  the last time being two months ago. After losing two of my children i am also depressed but I try to keep a positive attitude for her.

Our second miscarriage was in the second trimester and was very difficult as we both started to feel like ""mommy and daddy"". We were ""competing"" over which gender it would be.

I thought the baby would be a boy so i bought a bunch of baseball stuff for babies, little hats and mitts. I also made my ringtone on my phone ""watching scotty grow"" by bobby goldsboro. Just sort of a playful thing since i joked we would name him after my grandpa scott, she wanted a girl and made hers that ""girls want to have fun"" song.

Anyway, the baby was a girl named Charlotte. Shes been despondent these past few months. I havent been exactly ecstatic either but she wont even eat some days.

I kept my ringtone the same for a little bit, partly because i was sad and partly because i forgot. She heard it one day and started crying terribly. I changed it, but i also resolved then to try and make her feel at least somewhat better.

Wife doesnt like cats and dogs arent allowed where we live but she had a hamster growing up. I bought a baby hamster with a big glass case and put a teeny tiny pink bow on her. I gave her to my wife with a card that said ""Would you be my new mommy?""

She reacted terribly to it and said that it made her feel horrible and that i was being an insensitive asshole. Im just trying to help and the way she reacted put me on the defense so we got into an argument and arent on speaking terms since last friday. I keep the hamster with me on the coffee table as i sleep on the living room couch. Ive seen her play with it but she wont talk to me.

AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?,"My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out.

To say I'm angry is an understatement. He claimed the first few feet of our driveway is public property controlled by the city and since it wasn't kept clean and damaged his car we need to pay.

I asked him to leave our property before I called the police... he told me to go ahead. At that point, I closed the door and locked it.

AITA for refusing to pay for my son's college a second time?,"My son was supposed to have just wrapped up his junior year in university. It turns out, he has been failing and dropping lots of classes. He always told my wife and I that his grades are fine and that his GPA is okay. The only access we had to his school account was to make tuition payments. We even paid for a more expensive school because he really wanted to go there. His sister also went to this school and had a great experience so we were okay with it. 

He came home this summer and told us the truth. He had been on academic alert since his first semester for failing a class. However, his GPA was still okay because his other classes pulled up the F. Overtime, he started failing and dropping more classes and his GPA went down more and more until he hit probation. He was suspended for failing to bring his GPA above a 2.0. Apparently he appealed the decision and the dean told him he could have one more chance instead of taking an involuntary year off but he would be dismissed from the school if he failed anymore classes. Well lo and behold, he failed another class and was kicked out. He then had no choice but to come clean to us.

We have spent around $28,000 a year ($18,000 tuition + $10,000 dorm/food, not including the spending money we gave him every month). We spent $84,000 for him to only come out of that school with 34 credits. We did this because both of us graduated college with huge student loan debts and we wanted him to enter his career with no debt. 

He applied to another school as soon as he found out he was suspended and got accepted. However, I told him I would not be paying anymore tuition, and that he would need to take out federal loans (and that we would not be cosigning on any private loans). I eventually relented and came up with an idea. I said he could earn my trust back by going to community college for a semester or two (which we would pay for). If he passed all of his classes, then we could pay for his other university on a semester-by-semester basis and we would need to see his grades online every term. I also said he would need to go see someone at school to figure out what bad habits or learning issues led him to this point and to help him avoid it from here on out. If he felt like he needed any kind of therapy, we would cover that too. 

Well my son absolutley hates the idea of going to community college. My wife thinks I'm an asshole for refusing to just give him a second chance without all of this community college nonsense. 

I also mentioned to my wife that college isn't for everyone and if this doesn't work out, maybe he needs to look into a trade. She wouldn't hear that either.

Am I the asshole for not handing out second chances without shackles? I feel like just going to another university won't just magically fix the issues that landed him in this mess to begin with.",AmItheAsshole

Minor Daughter Refuses Abortion.,"TW: Sex, Minor

&#x200B;

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm still shook and my boyfriend and I have been freaking out since we found out. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

Our daughter is 11 years old. We found out she was pregnant. She had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. We never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

It was clear she had a crush on him, but I never thought anything of it. Until she started complaining about things, I'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when I had been pregnant. 

I didn't jump to the conclusion, but I did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

They'd been having sex. God knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. I won't go in to details. Because I never wanted to imagine them myself. 

We had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. My boyfriend was fuming after I told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

They knew as much as we did of the whole thing. They were as shocked as we were. We've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

But she keeps saying she wants a baby. And I just don't fucking know what to do. I tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  I was trying to be level headed. But she didn't seem to understand at all. We've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

What can I do? Is the boy, or his parents liable? What can a doctor do? Can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?

Bad guys need to prevail more often in movies/shows.,"I hate that in like 95% of movies, it's just the protagonist overcoming some seemingly impossible odds to defeat the antagonist. It's so predictable, overdone and mostly unrealistic. It takes away from the suspense because you know the good guy will prevail in the end.

One script that I really enjoyed was the Hunger Games series. Spoiler warning just in case. Now technically the good guys still won in this series, but it turned into quite a Pyrrhic victory in the end as the protagonists had to sacrifice so much to win, that the worthiness of the cause was up for debate by the end. I fuck with that shit honestly.

Another example would be Game of Thrones. Spoiler warning again. The Red Wedding? Loved that shit because it drew a new emotion that I hadn't experienced in film before. To have such major protagonists like that so suddenly ripped away was more compelling than if they had lived imo.

I don't know whether this opinion is unpopular or not but it seems to be with how often the protagonists prevail in film. I'd just like to see more variety in story lines, I feel like the hero overcoming insurmountable odds to enjoy a happy ending is just way too overplayed.

AITA for blowing up at my sister because she kept trying to say that I'm traumatized?,"My younger \[23\] sister and I \[27\] were both adopted at birth. I'm trans racially adopted (our parents are Caucasian) while she is the same race as our parents. Neither of us are biologically related to each other or our parents. We both had happy childhoods and our parents were always supportive of us. We always knew we were adopted and I never felt that my parents loved us any less than our brother (we have one older brother who is our parents biological child). Neither of us had ever cared to look for our birth parents when we were younger but our parents said that we would be able to when we turned 18.

About a year ago though someone suggested to her that she read the Primal Wound. The gist of the book is basically that if you're adopted you will be traumatized for the rest of your life because separation of a baby from the mother is traumatic. I read a bit of it and I didn't care for it and honestly I thought it was bullshit. If the book's hypothesis were true then children whose mothers died in childbirth would be traumatized or those born through a surrogate. 

However, she took everything she read to heart and basically blamed adoption for all of her problems. She did 23andme and was able to find her birth mother. Her birth mother was nice to her at first but I'm not really sure what went down but she eventually had to tell my sister to keep away. The birth mother had remarried and had done really well for herself and was not interested in the close relationship that my sister wants. From what I understand, she apparently had wanted to keep her but was unable to do so because of financial reasons. She regrets giving up her sister but at this point in her life she has come to terms with it and has decided with her husband (who is not my sisters father) that they can't be there for her as her parents. (apparently my sisters  bio dad died in prison about 15 years ago) 

Since then my sister has been very moody. Every time we see each other she pesters me to read the book and we end up fighting about it. All she does is complain about how her life would be so much better if her mother had kept her or if our parents had given her bio mom money so that she could keep her. 

Finally last night when we were having dinner together she started her usual complaints. I finally got mad and went off on her telling her that our parents were the best thing that had ever happened. She probably wouldn't have done well with her bio mom and adoption isn't traumatizing and that book completely messed up her life and I wish she hadn't read it. She is now not talking to me.

You cannot do anything to help the fires in Brazil and Russia.,"I know everyone is upset about the forest fires in Brazil and Russia, and I love to be Johnny Rain Cloud.

Brazil and Russia are both media locked countries with vastly underfunded public services.

Why?

Russia is Russia, not much needs to be said about that.

But Brazil spends more money every year on its Futbal team than it does on all its collective services combined(they've nearly bankrupt the country 3 times in the last 20 years).

There is literally nothing you can do to help. Any charities you donate to will be padding their own pockets, and the governments don't care what you have to say.

If you want to make a difference, do it BEFORE the fires start, not when it's trending on twitter.

Plastic straws make up less than 1% of the total plastic waste, and of that less than 10% ends up anywhere near the ocean. There is literally evidence of ONE sea turtle hurt by a straw in the last 25 years. (Not counting the hundreds that die with plastic in their stomachs, but there's no data on how much of that is made up of straws)

Nearly 60% of Ocean plastic waste comes from China and India. Two more media locked countries that YOU can't do shit to change.

Now that I'm done being a dick, YOU can make a difference. But you need to be smart enough to know WHERE and have enough dignity not to resort to virtue signaling so your friends THINK you're making a difference.

I know very few of you read these long post I make anymore because no one wants to be told they're wrong. I get that. But you can make a difference, you can change lives, and the world. Unfortunately, it has to happen before the world cares, because by the time the gods of this modern world of narcissism look down on these issues and grace them with a twitter post, and a story shout-out on Instagram, it's usually too late and the ""awareness"" raised counts for shit.

Make a difference before the trend, if you care to.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by being so pregnant I couldn't see what I was wearing before I went on stage,"This just happened a couple of hours ago. I am 8 months pregnant and *huge*. So I am in the choir at my church, and we were singing a special Christmas song, so everyone was supposed to dress festively. I also had to sing a solo before the message, which I was *very* nervous for. 

I picked out a nice red maternity dress with beading on the collar and wore black tights with black velvet kitten heels. I even painted my nails to match. 

The first service went smoothly... but when I got home, I noticed I had prominent underarm sweat showing on my dress. *Great*, that's probably what everyone was staring at during my solo, lol. So I was determined to prevent this from happening in the second service an hour later. I took off the dress, dried it off, and changed into some pajamas to have breakfast. I also put on an undershirt and stuffed a bunch of tissues under my arms so I wouldn't sweat next time.

Before I knew it, I was running a bit behind, so I put my dress and shoes back on and hustled out the door. I got to the church a minute before the service started and rushed out of my car. Someone asked if it was too windy for me. We're in South Florida, so I had no idea what they were talking about and continued rushing for the doors. 

Unfortunately, the service began a moment earlier and the choir was already on stage. I grabbed my songbook and lumbered onto the stage from the middle aisle, to my place front and center with the other sopranos. Everyone smiled at me awkwardly, which I figured was due to my tardiness.

We started with a hymn... That's when I realized I felt too much fabric around my legs for the kind of dress I was wearing. I worried that the tissues from my arms had fallen and people could see them stuck to my tights or something. I could not see past my belly easily, so I leaned over to check, as conspicuous as it was to do so...

The sight and accompanying horror took a moment to register. There they were, my pink and teal flamingo print pajama pants. Still on my legs. And the whole audience sees them. How the freak did I not notice, and how did I get on stage without anyone telling me?!? 

I rushed off the stage mid-song and took the offending pants off in the bathroom, then waddled back up to my spot. I couldn't even run off afterwards and hide, because I had to sing a solo immediately after that! On the bright side, my stage fright for that was gone...

TLDR: Changed clothes in a hurry between performances at church. Unintentionally sang on stage wearing flamingo pajama pants because I'm huge and can't see my legs. ",tifu

AITA for keeping a gift solely for my son rather than splitting it between him and my girlfriend's kids?,"I've been with my girlfriend for four years now.  I have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her's.  My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  

Pretty much since my son was born I've put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I've been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I'm proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I've daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  

My girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we've come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn't want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. 

We are a great team usually.  It's almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She's fighting dirty too, she's been making it out as if I don't really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That's not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn't even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she'd never admit it. 

I honestly don't even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there's just a big ""NO"" feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. 

I also feel like it's really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don't particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. 

Neither of us have been backing down and it won't be too much longer until it's time to give him the money.  ",AmItheAsshole
My neighbors didn't like the color of my house was so they had it painted a different color while I was out of town,"So this is a probably a really weird question for me to ask but it's a weird situation and I'm not really sure what I can do. My house is on a corner lot. Two years ago a newlywed couple moved in to the one house that's beside mine. Right away they started making weird comments about the color my house was painted (yellow) and soon switched to outright demanding that I paint it a different color. My house was painted yellow when it was built it, I like the color and there is no bylaw against it or anything. They have called the police on me about it as well as the city, both of whom told them to pound sound because I hadn't done anything wrong and there was nothing they could do. They also tried suing me in court (the suit was thrown out and they had to pay my legal fees) and getting our other neighbors together to form a Home Owner's Association in the hopes eventually I could be forced to paint my house a different color. Our other neighbors also told them to pound sand and they have basically alienated themselves from everyone else in the neighborhood at this point. 

I recently had to go out of town for something. I was gone for two weeks. When I got back two days ago my house was gray. Seriously. I actually almost drove past it because I'm so used to my yellow house. I knew immediately who was responsible but when I went over and knocked on their door no one answered. I think the couple figured out that I was away and not just at work when they saw our neighbors collecting my mail for me, because I sure as hell never told them I was going away and I know my other neighbors hate them too and didn't tell them. The neighbor from across the street came over and showed me pictures that he took of the painting company setting up and doing the work. He said he and another neighbor called the police but the painting company had a valid work order and had been paid so the police couldn't do anything. He also told about it but because they were paid to do the work they said they had to do it to avoid being sued. I called the painting company to get a copy of the work order and it was in the name of a ""Ms. Jane Smith"" and was paid for in cash. A redheaded woman and her redheaded husband came to the company to hire them (my neighbors are both redheads) saying they would be out of town and would like their house painted while they were gone. They gave the painting company pictures of my house, taken from the street. 

I have a surveillance camera at my front and side doors and in my backyard because I work shifts and as a woman living alone I don't want some stranger breaking into my house and waiting to ambush me when I get home. My neighbors never set foot on my property at any time so they can't be charged with trespassing and they didn't do the painting (which was actually done properly). When I called the police they re-iterated that since the painters were hired, had a valid work order and were paid to do the job, they can't be charged with trespassing because it was reasonable for them not to know and they were acting in good faith and didn't cause any physical damage to the house. Also the neighbors can't be charged with trespassing or vandalism because they didn't come on my property or touch the house themselves. I don't know if I can sue anyone because there was no actual damage or harm done to me or the house. My neighbors still have not answered their door or shown themselves. I am pissed off beyond belief because I liked my yellow house and I can't believe how fucking crazy that they have been. I wish I could show a court or city council how psycho they have been over this. I want to know if I have any recourse or if I can do something to get them to pay to paint the house back to yellow. Does anyone know what I can do to get them to fix this and paint it back?

AITA for not wanting my son to be circumcised?,"Hello everyone!   


I dont know if this post is allowed due to rule 3. if so please remove it and I apologize. English is also not my first language so please be paitient with me. Now here is to the issue:   


I met my now wife several years ago when she was an exhange student in my country (Sweden). Long story short we clicked, got married and I moved with her to the US. Since sunday we are also now parents to a wonderful little baby boy and everything went fine with delivery. Now the problem is that my wife is jewish, she isnt religious her self but her father is and her uncle is a rabbi. I my self is an atheist and not a vocial antagonist towards it, I just think alot of it is silly and realy dont care much about it.    


Yesterday she dropped the bomb about him getting his circumcision when her family arrived, and baffled at the time I said no way am I maiming my son, if he wants to do it when he is older by his own free will its absolutley fine, but I refuse to let anyone do such a potential dangerous thing for something silly as religon! This did not land well and we had a big fight over it, it meaning alot to her and her pepole/family. She has never expressed any religious desires like this before (we have celebrated some jewish events but we have also skipped alot out of convinience). As I see it there are tonnes of potential risks, difficulty mastrubating etc so I realy dont want this for my son.  


Now it seam strange we never discussed this earlier, and in retrospec we realy should have,  but it realy was not in my thoughts since its an uncommon practice in Sweden, unless needed for medical reasons. Even if it legaly only require one parents consent in our state, any doctor will refuse unless both parents are on board.  Essentially she called me and asshole and a friend of hers agree.

"LPT: If your car gets a parking ticket, always check the plate number on the ticket.","Story time: yesterday I found a ticket on my car's windshield. It was from a private parking enforcement company and my car was parked on the street. I knew I was legally parked, and I also happen to be a former employee of this company and know that they don't check street parking (the city does). I checked the plate number on the ticket, and it was for a different car - same color and type as mine, but different manufacturer.

This is actually the second time something like this has happened to me. The first time was when I was working for this parking enforcement company. One of the perks was that when I was off-duty I'd be able to park in company-run lots without paying and if I got ticketed, I'd just turn it over to my boss to void at the end of the week. One day I got a ticket for a car that wasn't mine and pointed it out to my boss, thinking that the lot-checker that day must really suck at his job. My boss says ""I know what this is"" and explains to me that sometimes people will try to get out of paying a ticket by leaving it on the windshield of another car, hoping that the other driver will pay it without noticing it wasn't for them. He said ""This is one ticket I won't be voiding - let's let them have fun with our collections department."" What killed me the most about that one was that the car it was for was a brand new BMW convertible, and I was driving a 20-year-old Mazda that showed all the signs of having been the car that two siblings and I had first learned to drive in. In the absence of any other evidence, I'm forced to assume the BMW belonged to Donald Trump.

Shockingly, they did and are now hounding us to pay for services we never authorized or even knew about until after the fact. In Montana.","As the title describes, my stepson's mother took him to the dermatologist. The treatment he underwent was not medically necessary, but I'm glad he had the appointment regardless. That's not the point. 

The issue is that several months after the fact, my husband and I recieved a letter stating we were past due and owed the office several hundred dollars for the kiddo. This was doubly confusing, as my husband has used this doctor himself and they're a pay at time of service operation. I called and the office manager said the ex had said to just bill it to my husband. I advised her that, obviously, the ex wife is not able to speak for us financially, so what the heck?? 

Her response was that the insurance they had on file (from my husband's visit there three or four years ago) was under hubby's name so they thought it would be okay. I advised her that, first of all, the policy she was referring to had been canceled years ago and that the family has been under my company policy for over two years now. And second, billing an insurance company is a little different than sending an individual a bill without any sort of communication much less permission.

She told me I'd have to come into the office and update my stepson's insurance information and pay the bill and then they would submit it to insurance to reimburse me. I told her that the divorce agreement states that my husband pays the insurance premiums, but deductibles or costs for medically necessary procedures, emergency visits etc. are split 50/50. Non essential services are at the discretion of the individual parent, and we hadn't given permission for any of this. And frankly, I shouldn't have to be explaining this to her because she should know better than to send bills to people who aren't even in the office or in communication with the doctor. 

The office manager proceeded to tell me that ""it wasn't fair"" to charge the ex and then submit to insurance for reimbursement (this office doesn't collect from insurance, apparently, they submit for insurance to pay the policy holder back after the bill is paid) because the insurance company would send the check to me and I might just keep it. I told her that's wildly insulting to suggest and, frankly,  none of her business anyway. She's not in a position to dictate how we handle the financial specifics of the divorce. 

She repeatedly insisted my husband and I are liable for this bill, so before I head to the office and handle this in person, I wanted some advice.

I arrived at the location, stripped down to my boxers in my car, and yelled out the window to a random dude outside who was taking pictures for people (he was in full arctic winter gear). He agreed to take mine, I threw him my phone and ran out of my car to the sign.

Took the picture, and ran faster than lightspeed back to my car. Get to my car door... door locked, keys in the ignition. It's -40C out and I'm almost naked. I frantically ran around until someone let me in their car to warm up. Due to the cold, my phone died. I have no ones numbers memorized. I was in serious trouble. 

Well, I go to the U. The building I associate with most was right up the hill from the sign. I had a spare key for my car in an office. However, it is inaccessible by direct road, so having someone drive me there was not an option. It was either someone drops me off at the closest point, or I run there in the cold (almost same distance). I didn't know these people and felt incredibly awkward, so I ran for it. 

2 minutes of blistering cold wind surrounding my uninsulated body. It was the worst feeling you could ever possibly feel temperature-wise.

I get to the outside door, and I couldn't stop shaking. I could barely open the door at all. All my skin was numb. There was a breezeway heater (which pump out a lot of heat), so I laid down next to it for a LONG time. I was laying in the hallway, almost naked, at 11PM, probably hypothermic and uncontrollably shaking due to my dumb decision.

When I came to 20 minutes later, I stumbled into the office, opened up Google Contacts on a computer, and called my roommate on the phone. He laughs his ass off, calls me an idiot, and comes to pick me up. Brings me some clothes to wear on the walk back. Saved my life.

So yeah. Don't run outside when its below 0F, nevermind -40F.

**TL;DR: Wanted to take a picture at a temperature sign at -40C. Phone died, locked my keys in my car, ran to the closest building 2 minutes away with only underwear on. Dealt with possible hypothermia, and a good story to boot.**

In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **Are you infertile?** I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

College applications should be completely anonymous.,"As the title says I think applications for college should be completely anonymous. They should only get your grades, test scores, extra curricular activities, etc. There is no reason for the schools to even know your gender, race, or economic background. I don't think any one applicant should be given even a fraction of an edge based off of any of those criteria. It should be 100% merit based. 

I was advised to add a little more to this but I don't really have any more to add. It's simple really, I don't understand why it is necessary for the admissions team to even know these characteristics. While obviously for many schools there are interviews, in those cases it would be anonymous up until you where offered to come in for an interview. They shouldn't even be given a name, just an application number at the top. This would combat racism, sexism, nepotism, and hopefully any other bias that might affect the application process if even by a small percent. ",unpopularopinion

I contacted a few lawyers in my family and they said the neighbors have no bounds to sue since trampolines are apparently illegal in my town.

Turns out the neighbors do not own the house and that they rent it, the owner and landlord of that house was miffed since he is the one that will have to pay the fines for the trampoline.  Turns out that the renters don't have renters insurance (which is why they asked for a cash payment from me). Last I heard was that the landlord gave them a 30 day notice.  As for me?

AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?,"I recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. I won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She's the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I'm not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I'm not *in* love with her. We've both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don't plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

Small breasts are infinitely better than huge fake breasts.,"Fake breasts look like they're...fake. They rarely look good. Even the best jobs still look bad. Most look like half volleyballs taped to the chest. They they maintain their shape when the woman lays on her back. They only look semi convincing when the woman is fully clothed.

AITA for telling a girl at the gym that her pants are see through?,"My gym has multiple squat racks facing mirrors opposite each other. This means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  Because it might help with context I'm 6', 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder) and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness model but not substantially overweight either).  

While in between sets, I'm standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first few heavy sets when I see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her squat and immediately notice that I can clearly see her ass through her pants. 

Like 90% of people in the gym I just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn't exist.  So I move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and I can pretty much see her butthole.  I don't mean if I squint and stare, I mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

No idea why I cared (am married and completely uninterested) but I go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

""Hey this is super creepy, but I'd feel creepier if I didn't say something.  When you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.""

Again I thought I was being helpful and that she'd want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. This girl practically screams ""You fucking pervert! Stop staring at my ass!"" 

Not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, I go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.  

I tell my wife about it who laughs and says I was totally an asshole for saying that and she'd be pissed and super embarrassed if someone did that to her. So reddit, settle this, AITA?",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by stripping for my doctor,"Like most TIFUs this happened a few years back. 

I was at a free clinic for women to get a physical exam. They basically only check to see if you have scoliosis or not and clear you for all physical activity. After filling out my paperwork and waiting in line for about 4 hours, I was finally granted my five free minutes in the office. 

I sat on the table in my t-shirt and shorts and smiled politely as the old man with the stethoscope entered. He bluntly asked ""Please, show me your form."" To which I replied by sitting up as straight as I could on the table. He looked at me, and again he said ""miss, I need to see your form."" Slightly frustrated, I sat up even straighter. When he again said nothing, I asked ""How do you want to see my form? Sitting down? Standing?"" 

At this point the doctor is staring at me with a look of mass confusion. He asked me yet again to see my form and in a flustered panic, I took off my shirt and stood there in his office, showing off my perfect form. The doctor proceeded to burst out in laughter and through his cackling squeezed out the words ""Your papers! I just wanted to see your papers."" 

He told me in his 30 years of working that clinic, a girl had never stripped for him when he asked to see her form. I never went back. Moral of the stories, if they ask to see your form, they probably just want to see your paperwork. ",tifu

AITA for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though I'm not religious?,"I'm an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don't need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn't give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

Even though I'm a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She'd obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. 

For the last six months I've been having my 30 mins 'meditating' out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have 'meditative time' and it's causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and 'ruining it' for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I'm not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by making Indian food and making the same mistake 78% of people make whilst impressing girls with dinner.,"Throwaway because she knows my reddit handle but this happened about 1h30 mins ago. Buckle up because it turned out kinda long. 

&#x200B;

So I've been seeing a nice, athletic and 100% my-type lady for almost a month - nothing too serious, though. It was her birthday on Tuesday, but she never mentioned it to me and I don't really dabble in the social media shitshow, so I didn't know until she mentioned she'd been snowboarding for it. She didn't want me to make a big fuss because we're still kinda fresh and she had to work, so I said I'd take her out for dinner at the weekend (aka today) and that was that. Flashback to last night, she said she'd rather me make her my favourite ""British"" food for dinner and we can watch a movie at my apartment. All good.

&#x200B;

So flash forward to today. I'm a Brit, living on the West Coast of Canada, and finding authentic Indian food is hard because everywhere I go seems to be super whitewashed. So great lightbulb idea, lets make her biryani! As a human milk bottle, I will still toot my own horn whenever I have the opportunity to make Indian food so it seemed like the best food to impress. 

&#x200B;

So I made biryani about 4h ago. She said she didn't like cardamom pods, cloves or cassia bark, so I picked them out of the pre-mixed mix (I mix the mix every couple of months so I don't have to measure each time) and decided to add some red chilli peppers just to add a bit of flavour. Those small but very lethal fuckers. Obviously, this includes slicing them.

I have also read 10s of TIFU's where we're all just trying our best to please the lady in our lives and it ends up with mt Vesuvius vagina. Thirdly, I've done it before, to myself, and it's rough. To combat this, I washed my hands literally 12 times thinking it would be ok.

So we ate dinner about 3.5h ago and put on a movie. Once we'd finished eating, one thing obviously led to another, the sofa was reclined and fun was being had. The fun lasted less than 5 minutes before she mentioned that her Pompeii pussy was on fire and went to soak in the bath for 1h. We both found it hilarious at the time, but she left 20 minutes ago with a yogurt vag and has yet to text me. I apologized a lot so I'm sure she'll come round.

"AITA for telling my friend that if she kept up her ""no filter"" persona, we'd stop inviting her to hang out?","My friend, we'll call her Bridget, is one of those ""not like other girls"" people. She makes those posts on Facebook, talks about it, etc. It can get a bit annoying, but the biggest issue I have with it, is that she ""has no filter"". Now, I'm all for speaking your mind because free speech and all of that. But there are times when you need to have a filter. She's the type to point out when things are awkward between two people, but they're pretending to be civil for the sake of the group and just get through this outing, before they don't have to see each other again. Doesn't happen often, but it's happened a couple of times when people have had an argument or don't like each other and then things are even more awkward.

If someone is on their phone a bit, she'll wave her hand in front of their face and say ""Hey there"" and then call them on it. If they have a fashion sense that's odd to her, she'll make fun of them, even if they ask her to stop. She'll also tell you really random, graphic stories about her past, the same ones over and over. It's sad the first time, but your cocktail anecdote should not be ""My house burned down when I was 11 and my uncles died two days apart, plus I think they haunt me."" (The uncles didn't die related to the fire, they died of terrible diseases and these are tragic stories, and I'm sorry they happened, btw, I'm not trying to make light of it.) It makes people feel awkward, which you guess it…she calls them on and laughs about.

If you call her out on any of this, ""I have no filter"". A lot of our friends don't like this, but a bulk of them (including myself for a bit until she did this with me for way to long about the clothes) chalk it up to ""That's just Bridget"".

The other night, we were all hanging out and one of the guys had brought his new girlfriend. We were all talking about fairly, light, funny topics. Suddenly, Bridget brings up her uncles and started talking about their sickness, in excruciating detail. I can tell that the new girlfriend was getting pretty weirded out and I told her ""Hey, maybe we can talk about the time they took you fishing. That's a funny one."" 

But no, she continued until she was done. Then the room got quiet, as it always does after she tells this horrible, awful story about two men dying of cancer and she looks around, bursts into laughter and goes ""Well, now none of you have anything to say.""

Our friend's new girl looks humiliated and I just feel so bad for her. I say, ""Bridget, you need to cut this out. If you keep this up, people are going to stop inviting you to hang out with us. No one likes the way you talk to them. We've told you in the past."" She looked incredibly hurt and I said ""Sorry, I don't have a filter.""

Apparently, Bridget is still incredibly hurt and thinks I'm an ass. I do feel a bit bad, but at the same time, I am just sick of how she treats us as a group. Am I being an ass here?",AmItheAsshole

Well guys, I did it last week. I started vaccines.

I took them to our county medical office on a day that accepted walk-ins, we waited and they got the first round, about 4 combos each, with another walk-in suggested to me for 3-6 months to catch up the rest.

They cried so hard! The oldest kept crying off and on for an hour afterwards, so I took them to a Chick-fil-A for ice cream and playing to distract them. I took the bandaids off before we returned so my husband didn't notice.

That whole day, before I left and when we returned,  I thought somehow my husband knew, or would figure it out, but here we are about a week later and he's got no idea.

And guess what? They're perfectly fine now, no complications! (As I expected, DUH)

I don't want a prize or a cookie from y'all or anything, after all I remember to feed them and bathe them so vaccines are just another important and required step of parenting.  

I do want to say thank you so much to those that encouraged me to do this even though my husband was not in agreement.  I don't want my marriage to have any lies, but for THIS, it was the right thing to do.

Lastly, and most importantly:

For any parent out there in the same situation with your partner/spouse (many, many of you DM'd me) YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Take care of your kids and get them vaccinated, even if you have to go around your spouse like I did. It's worth it.



Tl;dr:  I vaccinated them last week. Husband has no idea. Walk in vaccines are available at the county health office, no appointment needed. Ice cream followed afterwards. Thanks for encouraging me, Reddit

Tifu when my wife found my Crayolas,"This fuckup didn't happen today but I'm paying for it right now. 
My wife (or maybe ex-wife) usually works during the day while I work nights and weekend so we don't really meet in terms of having time for the hanky pankies. She runs a daycare (this is important) and we have a ton of brand new toys stored in our basement for the business. Well me being me and bored I came across hundreds of boxes of crayons. In my never ending boredom after coloring stuff I was thinking what if I melt this into shapes. I'm not gonna explain how exactly I made these molds in my workshop because that's more of a diy tutorial. Anyways after about 15 attempts of melting and molding, I finally make the perfect crayoladick. Then I started mixing colors etc. eventually I had made about 50 of these all different colors and sizes. So we have this dog named Bonkers and he's a curious son of a dog. He roams free around the house and must have snuck in and grabbed one behind my back. Now you know how I said we work different shifts. Well wife home from work and I'm on my weekend shift still (Friday - Sunday) and my wife starts blowing up my phone. I guess Bonkers had dropped it in the toilet and wife found it thinking I was using it. Now I'm being accused of cheating on her with the crayons. She wouldn't answer my calls so I text her that I made these in the garage. It doesn't go over so well when she find 50 melted crayons phaluses in which I used the daycare's crayons to make them. I'm heading home soon and I haven't talked to wife since she found them. 

Update: Obviously didn't happen today. I'll start by answering some questions first. 

-This isn't a throwaway account, it was my lurker account. I made it to call somebody out on a post (see my first account post) and I just kinda never logged out. 

-The wife owns the building, it is not a home daycare. 

-This isn't the first time I've done something stupid with the daycare toys out of pure boredom, last time I used a needle and some wire to make a necklace out of doll heads. Wife was not amused.
 
-I invested about 6 hours of my free time on this crayon melting project. 

-It took about 40ish crayons to fill the biggest mold I produced. 

So the update. Wife wouldn't speak to me when I got home, she had taken all of my creations and destroyed them leaving the pieces in a plastic storage bin. It was the first thing I saw when I walked into the living room. Now it's morning and she wants us to do marriage counseling and thinks I should see a therapist as well. 
I'm a master electrician and I guess wife just doesn't understand my messed up humor sometimes. 
I never thought I'd get so many responses and upvotes on my original post. I'm not sure why it got deleted but I didn't delete it. 

TLDR: Molded penises out of crayons. Wife found them. Got home, found bin of destroyed crayon penises. Slept on couch with Bonkers. Wife wants to do marriage counseling and me to see a therapist.",tifu

"[ON] I caught my neighbors son stealing my underwear/other things. Family refuses to believe me or my landlord, and is threatening to sue me for slander. What can i do?","I am in Ontario, Canada. 

Moved in to the apartment at the start of January, since then i have been convinced that someone is stealing my underwear/bra/etc. Every floor has a pair of washer/dryer units, and since moving in i have had almost a dozen different things just disappear from the wash or dryer. The room is so tiny that there is no where to sit, aside from sitting on top of one of the machines, so it makes it very hard to wait for it. 

Two weeks ago i went and bought a bunch of new things, and when i went to go remove stuff from the washer i noticed that several things i had just bought went missing. Armed with this and the fact it was early Saturday morning, i went to our landlord and she was able to tell me during the 35 minutes of washing the only person who entered was my next door neighbors son. 

Now at this point i was furious and confronted the parents. The parents called me a liar, and basically told me off. They absolutely refused to believe me, however since confronting them i have had nothing go missing since then. 

Today i put laundry on and started cleaning my unit, when i went to go drop trash off, i checked the laundry and discovered our neighbors son going the dryer i was using. I again confronted the parents, and they immediately started screaming at me for harassing their son, and threatened to call the police on me for harassing their son, and threatened to sue me for ""slandering"" their son by implying he is a pervert. 

My question is, does this count as theft and can i go to the police and file a complaint? I don't want my clothing back, at this point.

TIFU by letting brain go automatic at the gym.,"Obligatory this-happened-last-week disclosure.

When I go to the gym, I put in my earphones and let the music absorb me. It eases the rest of the workout because it all feels like one swift process, and my brain goes on automatic, reflexively doing everything without strong conscious focus from me. That's usually not an issue, but, well...

It was time for my chest workout and I spotted a pair of benches lined up together, with the heads right against one another. One of them was free, and the other was occupied by a dude. Now, this man was something. He looked like he was the sole Supreme Warrior of all the lands of Pakistan. Biceps and triceps bulging so much they look like they aboutta spill onto the ground and start lifting weights themselves. Likely eats the equivalent of a Hindu Holy Cow in his daily protein shakes.

Fully absorbed by Sia's chanting in my ears, I walk over. Routinely, I remove the clamps and weights of the previous user on my bar and start searching for some 5kg weights. I take a few steps around, eyes scanning the floor and many racks for them, and my eyes finally set on a nice, jungle-green pair sitting on a rack. Dutifully, I start removing the clamp on the rack as to reach the 5kg weight, with only a small, nagging voice in the back of my head wondering, *""why is there a clamp on this rack?""* and began to pull out the weight.

And then, it happened.

The enchanting harmony of Sia's voice was penetrated by a booming, **HEY!**

My hands freeze, and my neck cranes upwards to see Commander Pakistan himself lying down on his bench, looking ready to start his bench press with his hands gripping the bar above him, which just so happened to line up perfectly with the rack I was dealing wi— Oh. That's when it dawned on me. The ""rack"" I was pulling weights off was, in fact, the bar he was using, and I was about to casually give this guy a serious injury had he lifted the bar, ignorant to my oblivious meddling.

I ripped out my earphones, threw my hands back, and immediately started to apologize. Initially, I saw only trickles of smoke toot out the ears of our South Asian Demi-god—indicating he was only slightly pissed; later he seemed to find it funny, even cordially giving me tips for my workout. Very chill guy.

But damn, boys and girls. My automatism could've SERIOUSLY injured someone, and boy did I FU.

"AITA for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?","I am 24M and I have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. She is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. 

Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?

**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...

But the part where she says she's not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she'll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",AmItheAsshole
"UPDATE: I just recieved a demand letter from Enterprise Rent-a-Car stating that if I do not return their rental car, I will be charged with Embezzlement and Grand Theft Auto. I never rented a car from them. (San Jose, California)","Thank you to everyone for the advice. I'm also a SHE by the way (many of you thought I was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

After my initial post, I saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because Enterprise is the one at fault and I shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. So I did exactly this, and she told me that id I want her to give me more info, I would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that I am NOT the person who rented the car.  If not, she would report me for Embezzlement and Grand Theft to the Sacramento Police. Upon hearing this, I decided to file a report immediately online with the San Jose Police Department. I know many of you said I shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, I did not want to take any chances where I could end up with a warrant on my head.  I thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  After filing it, I emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  When I spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that I was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

On May 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. She showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had MY information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with CASH. (I thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) The manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the Sacramento Police later that afternoon. The following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as FRAUD, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  At this point, I was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. I then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to Sacramento see who the hell this woman is. However, turns out I didn't have to because 2 HOURS LATER...  
  
  
  
THE SAN JOSE POLICE DID SHOW UP KNOCKING ON MY FRONT DOOR. ( 2 Policemen and 2 CHP officers) Before opening it, the first thing I did was grab the copy of the police report I printed because I seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). When I open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if NAME OF WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW lives at my home? I tell them no, and that I have no idea who that is,  then they ask if I am ALYMG and I tell them that I am. They then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of Fremont that morning. The accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. They then show the license to me and it's an EXACT replica of MY DRIVERS LICENSE, and I ask them how this is possible if I have my license in my wallet? They then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (The black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) I then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from Enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when I hand them my report. I explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from Enterprise.  So basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. I told the officers that I have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. I then asked them who is the NAME OF THE WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW and they told me that she is the who stole the car. However, I'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we DO NOT look a-like at all. Idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. But after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

I do have her name now though, and After doing a google search I found her Facebook and other social media accounts. I'm very tempted to message her but I've decided to leave this to the police because I have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she DOES know where I live) However, I do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

TIFU by suggesting Twin Peaks as a joke for the location of a company meeting.,"About two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.

As a joke I wrote in Twin Peaks as one of the suggestions.

I am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. The trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a HUGE margin.

I am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most RSVP's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.

The day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. In the ENTIRE process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. The organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. The waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.

About an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. By then it was too late. The money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.

I have to hand it to upper management. They powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. Although he did start the meeting with. ""I was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but I think I know why so many of you joined us today."" This drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.

Other than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.

It took all of 3 hours after the meeting for IT to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.

I was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.

I came in this morning and was informed I am to receive a write up for this. They are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. They understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at Twin peaks.

TL:DR Suggested Twin Peaks as a joke location for meeting. Bosses did not research Twin Peaks at all and we had a quarterly meeting at the location. I got written up for it. ",tifu

I found a tracking device in my car. What now?,"NY - Two weeks ago, my car was broken into in the driveway of my home. I didn't notice anything missing from the car, but the inner door pull on the drivers door was broken off and left on the passenger seat, which led me to believe that someone had been in the car (rather than it simply falling off from me closing the door). The following week, someone left a bouquet of red roses in the door handle of my car sometime between the time I got home at 9 pm and 8 am the next morning. My landlord put up a video surveillance in use sign after this as an interim deterrent before setting up actual cameras. The next morning, the sign was moved. No one on the property has done any of this, nor have any of our guests. 

I was worried that someone was following me, so had the car combed over. We didn't find anything on the outside of the car, but I wasn't satisfied, so I took it for a second opinion. We found a tracking device wired into the wires beneath the stereo (near the footwell of the drivers side) with a SIM card in it. All numbers on the SIM and motherboard look like they've been scratched off. 

We were able to connect the SIM to an old phone (it's a little larger than the ones in use today). UICCD for the SIM and other information is unavailable. The device was on and blinking before it was disconnected. With this info, the cops have been unhelpful because they say it could have been installed to prevent a previous owner from defaulting on a lease and that consumer grade tracing isn't illegal. But the device is exposed motherboard and wires and taped into place, not what I would imagine a dealer installing. 

I've spoken to my parents about it (the only people in my life who would be interested in my whereabouts) and they're just as bewildered as I am.  Is there anything I can do to have this further investigated from a legal standpoint? This is the last straw in a series of really strange anonymous harassment that's lasted for months.",legaladvice

AITA for not going home for my daughter's glasses?,"My wife Amanda and I have three children. Rebecca who is 15, Oliver who is 11 and Katie who is 7. Yesterday was the wedding of the daughter of an old friend of mine. Myself and the kids attended but Amanda was unable to because she had some work stuff that she needed to sort. 

In the car Rebecca was sitting in the front seat. It was a long journey to the wedding venue and she spent most of it taking pictures of herself for snap chat or whatever like most people her age do. 

It was a warm sunny day so we had the car windows open, and Rebecca was sticking her hand out of the window and eventually her face to ''feel the breeze''. I warned her several times not to do this, and eventually Rebecca's glasses ended up going flying off her face. We were driving fast on a motorway so there wasn't much chance of us being able to go back for the glasses. 

Rebecca needs a very strong prescription (-26) so going without glasses isn't really something she can manage. She didn't bring a spare pair with her but she does have one at home. She was upset and asked if we could go back for them. However, we were far closer to our destination than our home, and going back would take hours and we would miss the wedding. The younger kids were getting restless and spending the entire day in the car would be very frustrating for them. 

At the wedding Rebecca was upset at being unable to see anything. Her siblings had to guide her around everywhere and she felt ''humiliated'' at having two younger kids literally dragging her around everywhere. She didn't know where to look in photos and couldn't see what the bride and groom looked like. 

When we got home Rebecca got Amanda to get her spare pair of glasses, and as soon as she put them on she ran off to her room and we could hear her crying for a long time. 

I told Amanda what happened and she was not happy with me. She asked how I could be so ''irresponsible'' as to let our daughter be blind for hours. I agree that it wasn't a nice choice to make, but the alternative was subjecting the younger kids to hours sat in the car, and also missing a wedding which one of my oldest and closest friends invited us to.

"I bought a house, 3-days later a man caused over $60k in damages via crashing his car into my house, his insurance company sent an agent who lied about her identity.","Lucky me. Thankfully I decided to purchase a fantastic Insurance policy. Damages are over $60k... question for others who may have been in this situation, or could possibly tell me another sub to get advice. My insurance company has been great. The man who hit my house has garbage insurance. My insurance company always alerts me when they are coming or sending anyone. The other day I was checking my security cameras to see if Orkin actually came or not, when I saw a lady knocking on the front door. Nobody uses the front door because of the extensive damage. My fiancé answers and the lady states she is with our home owners insurance and even states the name of our insurance company. I asked my fiancé about it to which I get a ""idk I was in the middle of something."" Something did not feel right, I email everyone on my team, my claim is under the large loss department, so a fairly large team of about ten people. They all state that they did not send anyone out. I send them the video footage. The subrogation rep on my team dug and found out the lady was from the insurance company of the man who hit my house... why would they lie? Should I do something about this? Why give false pretenses that are usually indicative of malicious intent? 




I would post the video but I do not want it to be public, it's very clear she is pretending.

If two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped,"I see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. If two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? The logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? I will never understand this or accept it. I agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. Reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. I cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

Edit: I've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things I think I should clarify. I absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. I have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. Im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what I have seen and what I believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

One of my cousins (let's call her Anna) asked everyone if they wanted to come over for dinner on the last day. Yeah sure, why not.

Lasagna for dinner. I'm finished, but I didn't finish my whole plate. I walk over to the trash can and throw the food away.

As I'm walking back I notice a trash can. Wait... what? Didn't I just throw it away in the trash can?

No. No I didn't. I threw it under the sink where I THOUGHT there was a trash can. There was no can there. The lasagna is underneath the sink.

No one noticed. I'm saved! Nice. I'll just leave it there. No big deal.

I've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, I can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) The day after my post, I called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since I inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. He went to both houses the next day, saying that I had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. He went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. Apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how I need to learn my place. After he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) I conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. As expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. I'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, I never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until I watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) The bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""Our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that I'm getting married!"" The pastor, feigning innocence, said ""I thought she was evicting you all because your father and \[Groom\]'s father cut down \[My Great-Grandmother\]'s prize magnolias?"" Hardest game of You-Laugh-You-Lose I've ever played, still proud I survived.

4) According to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. Then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say I would be quite happy with half that number, but I know when to zip my lips so I'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) They did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. I have enough savings/inheritance left that I can live without the rents for a while, so I'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before I was born.

6) The bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. They had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (Am I a bad person for being amused?)

7) Hurricane Michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) My boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

TIFU by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop [NSFW],"so today I had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, I'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story I'm 27 and I live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time I've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. Now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and I for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. We've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

So on top of making porn I'm also an aspiring film editor and I am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but I also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us I'd been editing a new video, usually after editing I go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because I'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. We were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, I immediately said sure and led him into the office, now I could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and I kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. So I lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as I opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst I ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

I panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

Her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and I are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but I hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and I'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



TL;DR I unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

UPDATE: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so I'll explain, as I said earlier in the post I watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep I just shut the laptop without even thinking, I do this often (I know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. Still haven't heard from her dad yet. I honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and I laugh a lot so thank you

I walked up to the door and lo and behold, 5'2"", baby blue eyes, strawberry blonde hair, all the right curves in all the right places.  I couldn't believe my luck. 

I asked her what she did for a living. She said she taught sunday school. Now I never had me a Christian girl, but I'm open minded so I took her to dinner.

On the way, I lit a joint and asked her if she puffs.

""Oh heaven's no, what would I tell my Sunday school children.""

I said okay, weed's 50/50 some people do some people don't.  And I took her to the best restaurant I knew. I ordered the steak, she ordered the lobster. I asked for the second most expensive bottle of wine on the menu. When the waitress came to pour, She said she didn't drink.

TIFU by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging,"Happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

I was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. I noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

Normally, I wouldn't think twice about it, but I was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. Plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

We pull up to a stop light, and I hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. Apparently he didnt see me, because when I said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

Being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, I let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

As I turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. The way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

As I'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. It didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

She then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as I'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. The way she viewed it, I was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

The cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

TL;DR I stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

Edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. It was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford F-350",tifu
TIFU by allowing my husband to come to dinner at my boss' house,"This actually took place a couple of years ago.

I had just gotten a brand new job that I was really excited about. So I was delighted when my boss - who I had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. 

Well, mostly delighted. My husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. Because of this, I was worried about him coming along. 

By the time the day of the dinner arrived, I had become so anxious about it that I actually floated the idea by my boss that I wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. She was clearly taken aback and responded ""Oh no! I really hope he can, I have a dinner for 3 all ready to go."" Upon seeing her dismay, I assured her that I was sure he would find a way to be there. 

Well, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. It was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.

I had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. 

My boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when I noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. It was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.

I look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. Before I had a chance to fully comprehend what I was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. It hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. 

Now my husband does dumb shit, I already told you that. But he's not a crazy person. Usually when he does dumb shit I at least understand what he's thinking. There' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.

In this case I was just dumbfounded. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. 

I couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but I also didn't have time to try. I heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.

It suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. He did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. 

I could feel the anger flush through my face. For a brief moment I contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. But No. This was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. Not like there was any possible recovery anyway.

My boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill There's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. My boss and I are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

He finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. I leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. 

He makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. Mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.

We all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.

As soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.

Turns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. My husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. He thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. 

A year or so later my boss hosted a Christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. My best friend, Jennie, was my +1.

TL;DR: Took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. He thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.

**Note:** My husband [told this TIFU from his perspective a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. Someone suggested I should tell it from my perspective. Hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)

**Edit:** OK Guys, I probably overplayed the ""dumb shit"" angle. Yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  From my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. Go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. My husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. 

**Edit 2:** No my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although I get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. The usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. If he would've done that, it wouldn't have shocked me at all. This, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn't do things that make him look insane*.  Not sure why some seem to be taking the ""he often does dumb shit"" to mean ""he often does completely insane things"", when I feel like I was making the exact opposite point. Oh well. Glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  Also, we all have our faults. I joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc.",tifu

AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?,"I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?,"I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.

Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?

I found a stray dog while in vacation on the big island of Hawaii - what should I do?,"[Kohala's gofundme page is now live for anyone wanting to help with her vet bills!](Https://www.gofundme.com/kohalas-vet-and-travel-expenses) 

UPDATE 3/28: [Here are some photos from Kohala's first week in her new Seattle home!](https://imgur.com/a/orx6g) 
She's settling in perfectly and I couldn't be more pleased with how to other 2 dogs have welcomed her into the pack! The other female dog absolutely loves her and they've been spending a lot of time playing and snoozing together. Kohala is making fantastic progress on potty + crate training. She responds well to the LIMA training approach and very quickly figures out what I want her to do. She's becoming more and more puppy like everyday and I'm so happy to see her coming out of her shell since her rescue. 

I want to thank everyone who has donated and shared her progress, especially those who have messaged me with kind words and support! With the help of everyone on Gofundme, she's been able to get all of her veterinary care and is on an all natural puppy diet. I'll be posting progress photos as she gains more weight :) 

VET UPDATE: We took her in to the vet and she had all of her vaccinations, dewormer, and microchip done. She's not pregnant, just in heat. Obviously we'll have her spayed at a later time when she isn't in heat. The vet noticed that she has a weird injury on her front left leg that looks like an entry and exit wound. He thinks she may have been shot or impaled. She has pain medicine for the limp and if it doesn't improve, we're going to have her X-rayed when we're back on the mainland. Overall, she's looking good! Just need to fatten her up to a healthy weight. 

UPDATE: we called Kohala animal rescue and spoke to them. They said if we surrender her here she'll be euthanized. They're helping us with paper work and she's our dog now! She's coming home with us to Seattle! 

UPDATE #2: we named her Kohala after the area we found her in. She's already cuddly and quirky and completely inseparable from us. We tried to set her up a bed in the garage, but she started crying when we walked away. We're going to hide her in our room until we can find somewhere pet friendly to move to in the morning. Thank you to everyone for all your kind words and support!

My friend and I found this young dog in the middle of the rain forest on Hawaii and it's obvious she's been out here a long time. She's extremely skinny, her tummy and vulva are swollen, so we think she may be pregnant or sick. She obviously needs to see a vet. We fed her a little bit of wet food and gave her some water and now we're letting her rest while we figure out where to take her. Advice on how to best (and affordably) handle this situation is appreciated! Also, suggestions for other subs to post this in would be awesome! I may consider crowd funding to help with her vet bills if they're more than I can handle, but I have never done it before. 

I'm here until Friday morning, then I leave for Seattle, WA. 

I'm also curious about what the process is like if I decide to keep her, and what would be required to have her transported to the mainland if anyone has any resources for that.

AITA for finally snapping at my wife about my drinking?,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons as my wife uses Reddit but not this sub.

I know how that title sounds but please bear with me for a minute.

My wife(32f) and I(33m) have been together for 10 years in October and married for 6 of those years. She comes from a... broken home to say the least. Her mother was a drunken alcoholic and her dad was never there, she has one brother and he's a junkie as well. Her life growing up was not easy and I will always respect her for rising above all of that and persevering through it all.

Now onto my problem. My wife has an issue with *any* substance that can get you high or drunk and understandably so. She made this clear after about 2 years of us dating when she told me about her family. Now this I have no issue with, I asked her if me having a few beers socially would be an issue and she said no.

Cut to the last few years and her anger to booze has become *much* more apparent. She claims my drinking 2 beers after working a stressful day makes me an alcoholic. Now if I was drinking every day she may have a point but I have maybe 3 beers a week at most and *maybe* once a month I may go to my buddy's place and play overwatch and have a few more. I don't get drunk by any stretch at my friend's place but just a good buzz and uber home. I have only ever been legitimately drunk 3 times in our relationship, NONE of which she was around for and only ever heard second hand. I like to think I'm respectful about it; I keep my beer in the minifridge in the basement, I don't drink in front of her and at her request I don't talk to her at all when I have those few beers on a friday.

I have in the past quit drinking because she asked me to. Last time I quit for 2 years just because. Quitting is never an issue for me but her badgering me and claiming I'm an alcoholic *all the time* finally caused me to snap at her and tell her that just because her mother was an alcoholic doesn't mean I am. I told her that her extreme hatred for it is causing more issues for me than anything else in my life at this moment. She will literally go from the most sweet person to a completely passive aggresive person in one second when she realizes I bought a 6 pack for the next 2 weeks. The obvious answer is to just quit which would be fine but sometimes I just like to unwind after work you know? I don't get trashed on a regular and I don't let alcohol get in the way of my life so I'm at a loss. If she said ""it's me or the booze"" then I would 100% pick her but my issue is that her problem with alcohol isn't rational and it's not *me* she has an issue with but instead her issues with her mother.

We go out enough and we both hang around with people who drink and she has no issue with them so here I am wondering if I'm an asshole. I feel after a few years of her yelling at me I was justified in getting a bit upset but her friends are calling me an asshole.",AmItheAsshole
How to make arrangements for my daughter in case my wife and I are arrested?,"My wife and I both work at the same place, and generally the same shifts.  If we get raided by ICE, we will probably get picked up together.  What is the best way of making sure that our daughter is taken care of?  We have no family here but there are some friends who can take her in for a short time.  If it will be a longer time, then we would like her to be sent to live with my parents or my wife's parents in Mexico.  Is it safe to discuss this with her school, or can that get us into trouble?  How about the doctor's office, is it possible for them to do anything to help her in that case?  Should we write a will, and how do we go about doing that?  

We are in Bakersfield, California.  Both of us work at the same facility (agricultural).  Our daughter is 8 years old and US citizen and she attends public school.",legaladvice
"Refusing to consider fat people when dating is not, nor will it ever be ""shallow"".","Often you'll hear fat people (usually women) complaining about how shallow everyone else is who refuses to date them or even find them physically attractive, based on their weight. The general argument tends to go along the lines of ""You should love a person for who they are on the inside, and not what they look like on the outside"". 

However, what many of them don't seem to realise is that by refusing to date them, it's about more than just their appearance - It's about their personalities and their lifestyles. Being fat is more often than not, a result of having a lack of self control. Yes, chances are they do care about their overall health and appearance, but usually not enough to willingly do something about it. 

Things like hiking, walking the dogs, or even spending a lot of time on your feet while travelling will be too much for them to handle, and they'll slow you down like all hell. Unless you each prepare your own meals, eating healthily goes out the window also, whether due to an increase in the amount of junkfood and takeaways being consumed, or even just home-cooked meals that are high in calories. 

Between the lack of exercise and increased caloric intake, chances are that you too, will also gain weight over time. You're potentially looking at a significantly shorter lifespan for not only yourself, but even possibly your future children, who will likely follow in the footsteps of their parents. 

Wanting the best for yourself, your partner and your children is not ""shallow"". Expecting a healthy person to push all of that aside to accommodate for your size on the other hand, it kind of is.",unpopularopinion

We need to stop telling kids they can be whatever they want to be.,"Hold up, just hear me out. I'm not saying we should destroy the dreams of kids, but I'm absolutely in favor of not over-inflating a child's hopes to the point where they can't cope with any future failure.

We should be realistic with children from a very young age. Say things like, ""You can do so much"", ""The future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""You can be literally anything you want to be""

I think it would help kids understand that while they have so much potential, there are some things they can't control.

"TIFU by saying my best friends wife might have cheated on him, during their speaker phone call to announce their pregnancy.","Just a simple fuck up that I made a few months ago, but I thought it would be fitting. 

My friend has been in an off and on again relationship with a really great girl. However, there was a point in which she was cheating on him. This time has passed (as far as we all know) and they are happily married now and expecting a baby in the next few months. 

Anyway, the day he called me to tell me the news is when I fucked up. I get the call, and i can tell that I am on speaker phone. I had no idea that his girl was also on the call with us. He says something along the lines of..

""Guess what man!! Me and (So and so) are having a baby!!""

Me, being the unfiltered and untrusting idiot that I am.. replies 

""DUDE YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THAT BABY IS ACTUALLY YOURS BRO!! Get a DNA test done immediately. She might be tryna get you to pay for another's dudes baby!!""

And of course, that comment is followed by a very long and ackward pause, until he says..

""Um. Oh no, haha. It's mine. (So and So) is actually here in the car with me. Your on speaker dude...""

And that is the moment I knew I fucked up. 

""Oh......... hey (so and so). Congrats guys!!! LOVE YOU BYE!!!""

TL ; DR    I fucked up by telling my buddy his wife may have gotten impregnated by another dude, while she was also listening to the call on speaker. All they wanted to do was share the good news with me.",tifu
