"a cowboy rode into town and stopped at a saloon for a drink. unfortunately, the locals always had a habit of picking on strangers, which he was.. when he finished his drink, he found his horse had been stolen. he went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head without even looking and fired a shot into the ceiling.

""which one of you sidewinders stole my horse?!"" he yelled with surprising forcefulness.

no one answered.

""alright, i'm gonna have another beer, and if my horse ain't back outside by the time i finish, i'm gonna do what i dun in texas! and i don't like to have to do what i dun in texas!""

some of the locals shifted restlessly. the man, true to his word, had another beer, walked outside, and his horse has been returned to the post. he saddled up and started to ride out of town.

the bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, ""say partner, before you go... what happened in texas?""

the cowboy turned back and said, ""i had to walk home.""",0

"for throwing away my dishes rather than wash them, even if my roommate can't afford to replace them?. i'm 28f, my roommate is 29f and is a single mother to an 8 month old.

we both contribute to rent equally, but basically all of the kitchenware is mine. i had it all before she moved in and we agreed before she moved in that we'd share them because she only gets so much money a month and it would be impossible to get her own kitchen stuff. it's no big deal to me, but at the time, her child was exclusively bottle fed.

now her kid eats rice cereal or oat cereal. i don't know how many people here are parents or whatever but this is the most vile stuff to smell. she mixes this porridge like sludge half and half with formula. it begins to smell immediately and after an hour? i've thrown up before from the smell. but whatever, kids gotta eat.

my problem is my roommate doesn't wash these dishes. she'll make this oatmeal stuff, feed it to her kid, then leave half of it remaining in the bowl in the sink, oftentimes when i'm at work. after 2-3 hours, it turns into cement basically, and our dishwasher won't clean it. i always have to clean it because she's busy with her kid. try as i might to get her to *just rinse it after use* so it can be put in the dishwasher, it falls on deaf ears. i even asked if she'd get tiny plastic bowls to make it and she said she can't afford it (a 5-pack is only like $5 and are dishwasher safe)...

after about a month of this, i've begun just throwing them out. instead of cleaning them, i throw my dishes away. we have no bowls now, she can't prepare this stuff in a plate. she's started using my cups to make it and i'll be throwing those away, too. it is nothing to me to replace these things and when i do, i'll be keeping them hidden.

am i the asshole or going overboard?",3

"i am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. my step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. can someone help me please?. i am really sorry if this is long but i have no idea where to turn to get help. i am also sorry if screw up terms. i am a minor, and i am about to start my last year of high school. i am currently living in toronto, ontario, canada.

my mom passed away when i was 2 and we lived in vancouver at the time. my dad remarried when i was 8 and i ended up becoming the youngest kid in the family. my step mom has always been mentally unstable and hates me in general.

my dad passed away \~6 years ago from cancer. before my dad passed away he told me that there was a trust setup for me with a fair amount of money to pay for my university from his first wife. he also told me that his will was setup to ensure that i wouldn't need to worry about anything for university or need to worry about money. he told me over and over that i would be taken care of no matter what.

earlier this month my step mom made a comment vaguely asking how i expected to pay for college/university on minimum wage. i told her what my dad told me, and she said that everything my dad had left was spent to take care of the family, and to send my older step siblings to university (she said it was ""first come, first serve""). she also has absolutely refused to help me in anyway as it is ""waste of her time"". i have ripped apart the house trying to find any sort of paperwork from my mom/dads estate but i cannot find anything.

i have tried to talk 2 lawyers who specializes in estates and wills, the first one told me he could not do a consult with a minor unless my guardian is present (no chance). the other one basically wanted a lot of money to even do anything which i don't have.

i have also tried to reach out to my estranged part of my moms family, her sister was able to dig up something with the name of the company who took care of her estate, but that company no longer seems to exist. my dad on the other hand was an only child, and as long as i remember i don't remember anyone else from his family, nor can i find anything.

i don't really know where to look or what to do at this point anymore. i am terrified that my step mother used this money to pay for all the frivolous bullshit she has wasted money on and pay for my step siblings tuition. i am also terrified that if there is really no money then i am basically going to get screwed hard, i need to get away from my step mother no matter what.

tldr; i am supposed to have money in a trust/will from both of my parents. my step mom says this is not true and all the money left by my dad was used to take care of the family and pay for my step siblings tuition. i don't know how to find out the truth or where to even start looking.",2

"overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller. my girlfriend and i have been dating for almost 3 years. last night she had some friends over after she finished work. i work from home so i only left my office to be formal and say hello and continued working. it was easy to hear the conversations they were having eventhough my office is down the hall. i then heard my girlfriend mention that she would leave me for a taller man.her friends made a comment on how i was a lot shorter than her ex boyfriend. my gf responded:

""if only he was as tall as ex he'd be 10 times better, if i could find someone taller than him, i would.""

i guess i should mention my gf is barely 4'11 in shoes. i'm 5'9. the issue isn't the height, but the fact that she would leave me for something so trivial. i talked to her about it since and said she didn't mean anything by it, just that she always dated taller men. she has since apologized multiple times.

is this a red flag of any kind of things to come or is it just me over thinking?

update: i didn't feel the need to make an entire different post for the update so here it is:

i left early in the morning to make sure i wasn't making irrational choices. when i came back she was immideatly apolegetic, but i didn't want any more apologies. i talked to her about how little respect she had for me that she felt the need to make jokes at my expense. she started crying and begging not to break up and feeding me the standard bs people say when they don't want to break up.

to not bore you with the details, i broke it off. i lose nothing at this point. 

i should clarify something from my initial post. i get that people can joke around and it doesn't mean anything, but when i confronted her about she denied it and got very defensive. that's the part that got to me. the fact that she tried to cover it up before apologizing.

i read all the comments and thank you.",7
"update mi boss won't pay after i keft my job. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/arxpqm/mi_old_boss_is_withholding_last_paychecks_until_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

so i would like to thank everyone that gave me advice on how to help. it helped ease my mind greatly. now, on to the details!

following what everyone suggested, i went to lara (licensing and regulatory affairs) and reported my old place of employment for not paying me around a month worth of checks after i left. i tried one last time to get my money from my old boss. when i asked him why he wouldn't give it to me he said and quote ""you fucked me over, now i'm going to fuck you over.""

that royally pissed me off. i felt hopeless when i read that. knowing someone intentionally was hurting my personal funds because i left his company. a shame. but that's when i found out i was still apart of their email system.

now i know this sounds bad, but they kept payroll on the email and i was looking to see if they were even planning in paying even though lara was just about to begin investigating.

this is when i heard from the irs saying i was misclassified as a sub contractor when i was really supposed to be a w-2 employee. i found my records in the email and sure enough, i signed a w-2 when i started.

essentially the investigation ended up concluding and my old boss has to pay lara back along with some hefty fines. his shop is actually set to close in a matter of weeks. karma is a bitch.

thank you all again!",2
"had surgery apr 5th. surgical assistant was ""medically necessary"" but apparently ""out of network"". $13,700 bill not covered by insurance.. i recently had surgery which apparently required a surgical assistant. throughout the whole surgical process, x-rays, mri, pre op appointments, the hospital confirmed each procedure was covered by my insurance (aetna ppo) before allowing me to schedule an appointment. the surgery was no different. the hospital, surgeon, and anesthesiologist are all in network and covered.

a claim from the surgical assistant was submitted to aetna - $13,700, to which aetna agreed to pay $118 because the surgical assistant was out of network.

i have two issues with this. first, i was under the impression that surgical assistants performing work in an in netowrk facility under the direction of an in network doctor would be covered as in network. second, i had no choice in who the surgical assistant was, didn't even know i needed one until the surgery. since i had no choice in the matter i couldn't tell them to make sure the guy was in network.

what are my options to get this bill covered as in network? i contacted aetna and they said a surgical assistant is covered under their plan, but said they would need to investigate whether or not this specific specialty was on their approved list.

has anyone else had experience with this issue?

thank you.

edit: i have gone through the responses and provided some additional clarification to some of the comments. i appreciate the help and insight people have provided. i will post and update in 3-5 days based on what aetna says about resubmitting the claim. ultimately, this is a frustrating time and it seems like no matter how much prep you do, there is always something that will slip through. i just wish there was more transparency. i could have been more questioning about who was going to be involved, but honestly when i was wheeled into surgery and saw 12 people in there i was surprised.

"by telling my coworkers i like kiddie porn.. this happened a few hours ago but i need to back up to last night to give a proper explanation.   

i've started watching chernobyl on hbo since got is over. i'm digging it so far and watched episode 3 last night. there's a scene where a group of 100 guys are digging tunnels under the nuclear reactor and it's hot. they can't use fans due to dust and blah blah blah so these men strip completely naked while they work. my immature ass thinks this is hilarious! i saw more junk in that 30 second scene than i've seen in 10 years. i'm giggling like a middle schooler pointing at all the penises. my boyfriend didn't find it as funny, but that's another story. the episode ends, all is well and i go to bed.  

then, this morning is when the fuck up happens. i'm chatting with some coworkers during break and someone asks me how my night was. my poor attempt at being funny was to respond with, ""it was pretty awesome, i saw a bunch of naked miners."" everybody kind of froze and just stared at me....i didn't clue in for the longest time. i just stared blankly back at them. nobody laughed at all and i could feel my anxiety closing my throat when it dawned on me. they thought i said naked minors!

so today at school i decided to talk to her and see what made her do what she did. and i must say i was sure surprised when she said it was just something that other people have told her and she was curious if it was true. so naturally i asked her why and she literally told me ""just because"". so then i asked her if she was aware of how uncomfortable that made me feel and how it hurt my feelings to which she just said ""sorry"". after that i really just lost it and went home to sleep. it really didn't go as i planned or wanted it to go, but i did learn some things if nothing else. my until recently ""best friend"" isn't really the best nor even a good friend. how blinded could i have been? anyway, her behavior answered some of my questions without even having to ask them and i'm pretty sure i just wanna stay away if i can and distance myself now. and yeah that makes me mostly angry than anything else but i can only hope these emotions will go away slowly. i guess those damn romcoms are a lie after all :)

"stole property and put the blame on someone else to keep apartment and split them up.. it was a really bad time in my life, before i managed to get on disability. i had no income and no one who believed i was really ill and needed help. or if they did believe me, they didn't want to help and labeled it a ""me"" problem. expected me to fix it and get on with living, like all i needed was a fucking antibiotic.

mental illness sucks. there is nothing glamorous or good about being stigmatized and marginalized into a byline.

was living in a 1 bedroom apartment with my ex and his current (both of our names were on the lease and he moved her in without asking; he wouldn't let me off the lease even after i moved i am still on it) when i had to take him to the hospital for feeling sick.  found out during that time that him and his girlfriend were doing heroin and she'd hit him with a dirty needle. i already knew she was struggling with addiction, but didn't know that he was using actively with her.

at the time he'd broken up with me because he couldn't cope with my mental illness issues; as soon as i was involuntarily hospitalized the 2nd time he moved on. i came out of the hospital to having lost my job. losing him on top of that was soul crushing. everything became about money.  he made twice as much as i did, we split the bills 50/50.  having no income stream meant i couldn't contribute anymore. instead of working through it with me he decided to tell me i had to leave (he would be patient while i tried to find a place but i had to leave was the bottom line).

two months after he was hospitalized with endocarditis and i dealt with her prostituting herself out of our house that climaxed (terrible pun intended) in her being beaten by a ""client"" who then stole money from her and destroyed the house and her getting more and more aggravated with me being in the apartment we shared, i broke down. through a family friend i managed to get a restraining order against her to keep her out of the house.  i put the house back together as best as i could, then realized that she hadn't payed the rent or any of the bills.  instead she had drained his bank account in addition to the prostitution to support her habit and lifestyle.

realizing he wouldn't have a place to come home to and also realizing (she had stolen my foodstamps, the only bit of contribution i could make while trying to find gainful employment etc) i had nothing to eat, i took some of his things and pawned them or sold them outright.  when he came home and noticed it was gone, i told him that she had been the one who stole his stuff. i went so far as to have the family friend mentioned above remove his television, gaming systems, and computer in case she came back-- figuring everything else that had disappeared was pretty replaceable in time.  i told him in the hopes that it would convince him to leave her.

&#x200b;

despite saving the fucking apartment and getting the lights turned back on, i wish i'd never done that. he deserved better.

&#x200b;

edit: upon rereading, i feel like it came out that the family friend helped me steal the things, i want to clarify.   feeling remorse over what i'd already done, i asked them to take the things so they would be safe until he got out of hospice care and i wouldn't be further tempted to act out that way.",11

i worked full time remotely at a company for 5 years. my wife is a stay home mom and we have two kids (a 2 year old, and a 6 month old). in the final two months of my employment, i got fewer and fewer projects to work on. in april, my boss emailed and told me they were going to change my full time employment to part time, dropping me from 40 hours to 8 hours or less per week, and that i will also lose all of my benefits. he said they didn't have have enough projects to keep me busy. i can't afford to lose my hours and medical benefits (it is what covers my family!), so i emailed my boss and pointed it out to him that cutting my hours from 40 hours to 8 hour or less is a lay off. that i would rather he just laid me off so i can start looking for a new job. he agreed and told me he is going to process my lay off per my request. 

i applied for unemployment and during the phone interview for unemployment eligibility, the interviewer told me my boss told them that i quit my job because i was not satisfied with the work. i told them that was not true as i was laid off. the interviewer told me they were going to investigate. today i called the edd office to follow up, and they told me my claim was denied and that i would a denial letter within a week.

"by being too horny for my boyfriends good nsfw. obligatory happened a couple days ago

i was enjoying a lovely morning with my boyfriend. talking, cuddling, farting together... you know the drill. just the comfortable phase of relationship when you no longer worry about being perfect human beings.
well, after some cuddling, i noticed that his morning wood wasn't gone. at all. and even though we had some amazing sex last night, i decided i wanted more. he was just so sexy, laying in his bed, i couldn't resist.

after some teasing, we went to do it. we're pretty boring, maybe too romantic and really lazy, so we wanted just a classic missionary. ya know, nothing too wild. but i want it quick and kinda rough.

while we were doing it, i'm telling him to speed up, even though i know he is tired from yesterday. and he does.

suddenly, he tells me he got a cramp in his back. okay, i thought, it will go away. it will be fine. it's just a cramp. let's continue. right?

wrong.

he stopped. his face looked like he was in a lot of pain. his whole body looked like he was in a lot of pain. and he was still  inside of me.

then he told me:""babe? i can't move. it hurts. i think i'm gonna need help.""

well.

i had to carefully operate myself from under him and take off his condom. i also had to try not to burst out laughing because of the absurdity or crying because he was in pain. 

the best part? trying to put his pants up, so he won't be totally naked when the fucking ambulance i had to call will arrive. the whole time he was almost screaming from pain.

the really best part? trying to frantically get rid off all evidence of what we were doing just for him to tell everyone ""yeah, i did this to myself during morning sex with my girlfriend.""

now he is stuck in bed for a week and i'm wondering if my pussy was really worth calling ambulance and all that pain.

"i (m26) just got cheated on/dumped by girlfriend (f23). have chance for revenge, should i take it?. some quick context. my gf of 2 years had to drop out of uni last october due to money issues. i helped her move to my city to start fresh. after a few months of living separately and saving, we moved into an apartment together and she got an awesome job offer. things were looking great. 

her new job requires her to attend a 3 month training course on a campus in a different part of the country. she's 2 weeks into this course and she's just told me that she's ending our relationship because she's started fucking another trainee. this means i now have to move out of our apartment because i can't afford to live here by myself (whereas she can). 

so i've lost my girlfriend and my apartment and naturally i'm pretty pissed. however i know that the training course she is on has a strict 'no relationship' policy amongst trainees, and is punishable by exclusion from the course. i'm contemplating sending an email to the company explaining the situation. i don't have any proof but i'm sure if they monitored her she would get caught out soon enough and sent home. 

i don't know whether or not to do it. i feel like she has just ruined my life, and as much as i'd like to walk away from this situation, part of me wants to get some payback. 

what do you guys think? dick move or karma?

update: you're all as indecisive as i am.  i'm going day drinking with my dad and will likely discuss this at length. will update later with my decision for anyone who gives a shit. (thanks to those who have left kind words, i appreciate it. the aggressive comments have made me laugh too so cheers.)

update 2: a lot of you guys asked for an update so here it is. despite a lot of convincing posts, i'm not going to do it. she needed a lot of support to get to this point (financial, emotional and otherwise) and without it i think she's perfectly capable of fucking up this opportunity by herself. i'm going to keep the apartment, even if it means i have to leave down the line. i want to put her through the stress of finding somewhere new to live whilst out of the city. 

thanks for all the kind messages (and the edgy ones). a lot of you guys are wise as fuck and gave some good advice. sorry to everyone that wanted revenge, perfectly ready for you guys to call me boring or a pussy or whatever.

"for refusing to meet my half sister who was a result of my dads affair?. mom and pops were married for 30ish years. i'm 26. always thought they were a dream couple until 5 years ago when i found out that my dad had fathered a child from an affair that he had in 2006. 

my mom went batshit crazy when she found out, i honestly believe her mental health cracked and deteriorated from then and she divorced my dad and moved to the other side of the us. essentially, i lost my mom to my dads idiocy, she is *not* the same woman as she used to be. 

my dad had always been in this girls life, but over the past 5 years i guess because he had no one to keep it a secret from he's more or less a full time dad to her. 

since the divorce i've kept my distance from him, i'm just trying to secure my bag , live quietly and stay away from drama. 

he has lately started up this crusade of me meeting this girl and developing a brotherly bond with her. i told him it's just not on the cards, i have no interest in picking up a relationship with anybody and i have my own hatred for my fathers new family and idc what anyone says, therapy ain't fixing that. believe me, i've tried. it's better for my mental health if i continue to do my thing and not involve myself. 

it's got to a point where everyone on my paternal side is bugging me for some sort of christmas miracle meet up, apparently this girl wants to know me very much and is begging that she gets to meet me as a christmas present. i've consistently told everybody 'no' and i'm also not celebrating christmas with them in case they try force anything. 

the only person on my side in all this is my fiancee, who is the only one who gives a shit about what hurt this might cause me instead of anything else. just wondering if iata for shutting everybody down over this.",3

"purchasing renter's insurance and no one will let me read the contract before signing it.. i'm buying renter's insurance for the first time because my new building requires it. i'm trying to be a responsible shopper by getting a few quotes, comparing them, and then reading the contract before i agree to it. this is how i've always been taught to make big decisions like this.

but apparently that's not how the rental insurance world works. i've talked to three companies now (state farm, allstate, and geico), and they've all told me they will not send me the contract before i make payment. i called the dc department of insurance, securities, and banking, and bafflingly, this is a perfectly legal practice.

i spoke to an understanding man at geico who explained that, at least for them, they were reselling the insurance of one of their partners, and they are contractually obligated not to release the contract before someone purchases insurance. he told me this is standard practice in the renter's insurance world and that no company wanted their contracts (called an ho-4) released prior to payment. he sent me an example of what an ho-4 typically looked like that he found online (here(https://www.uuinsurance.com/z_agent_pdf_forms/policy%20jackets/ho4%20renters.pdf)), but couldn't find the contract i would actually be agreeing to (assurant's march 2017 rental contract).

so here are my questions, from most to least pressing:

* does anyone have a copy of assurant's march 2017 renter's insurance contract for the district of columbia?
* is there a good source online for me to find more of these contracts?
* does anyone know if state farm and allstate are similarly resellers of insurance?
* if they are resellers, do you know who they would source a dc rental policy from?
* how can i get copies of these contracts before i agree to them?
* why does this business work this way?",10
"started selling my plasma. short story, but i'm a broke college kid who can't get enough hours at my work. i had a lot of debt from moving out and other things that came up unexpectedly. i had always donated my blood for free, but went to a place where they buy plasma. i found out my rare blood type (ab+) was worth a $100 a visit (get paid in gift cards).  this little extra income every week has helped me tremendously financially and i suggest if you are in debt or just want extra income, find out what blood type you have and look into how much people will pay you for it.

"for refusing to wear a bra while my boyfriend's friend is staying at our apartment?. about a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and i said yes. so the next day his friend shows up while i'm at work. when i get home i greet the friend (who i've never met before). i then proceed to go to the bedroom where i change out of my work clothes and throw on a t-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. i never wear a bra at home as i find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. i then go out to the living room to join them. as i'm sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of ""dude, put on a bra"". i figure he's joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so i just brush it off. he doesn't bring it up again for the rest of that visit. 

fast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. so his friend comes over and this time i'm home when he gets dropped off.  i was not wearing a bra when he arrived. i would like to point out that i was wearing a rather baggy t-shirt so it wasn't as if you could really see anything. that being said i do have enormous titties (i wear a size 40i bra). immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone ""i thought i asked you last time to please wear a bra!!""  i'm taken aback and i don't really know what to say. i kind of stammer our a ""what,why?"" 

him: i feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs 
me: but you can't actually see my boobs 
him: are you kidding me? they're huge! of course i can see them! 
me: dude, i'm wearing a baggy shirt. at most you can see a bit of an outline. i don't understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. 
him: you're joking right??
me: no...? 
him: fucking unbelievable

i look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. so i excuse myself to the bedroom. a little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if i'm ok. i tell him i'm fine, just a bit taken aback. he asks if i wanna come play video games with them in the living room and i agree. before we're out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe i should put on a bra.  i had explained to him before how i felt about bras. he said he understood but didn't want to make his friend uncomfortable. i was annoyed and told him i would just stay in the bedroom. so for the rest of his friend's stay i stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. 

so finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. he tells me i should've just sucked it up and put on a bra and that i was kind of being an asshole about it. i feel like i should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also i wonder if i should've been more accommodating to a guest that's very important to my bf.

about a month ago, i started working at for a large hotel company. i am a night auditor. i work 11pm-7am. i have a fair amount of downtime during my shift. 

however, i do not get rest breaks or a meal period. when i asked my boss about it, she said, ""you don't get a lunch."" she said this was due to the amount of downtime and the fact that i can eat a bite here or there throughout the night. practically, this translates to me having to just stand at the desk for the whole shift, with no ability to sit or be off-duty at all.

i was given the meal period waiver during my onboarding and i did not sign it. i have not given my consent to waive my meal period (which only applies to six-hour shifts, anyway).

i don't want to become a ""problem,"" but i am worried about my ability to just stand for eight hours with no relieve. 

do i have any options or anything here? or am i just being super entitled and shitty?

facts:

he usually borrows my photography gear regularly and this is the first time he dissappeared completely. before he dissappeared he agreed to borrow my gear for a day only.

he has been deliberately avoiding me for about 10 days before i thought of asking help from his friends and families thru social media private message.

i have even filed a report to the local authorities on the 5th day, but this was taking too long and i need my gear for an event! so i decided to asked for help from his contacts.

this was effective as some of his families contacted him when they saw my message to them. the day after that he shows up and returned all of my gear. it turns out that some of them got damaged but he promised to pay for them.

he is now threatening to file a case against me for humiliating him to his contacts. but if i haven't done that, i don't think i can get my gear back!

this was my message to his contacts:

""hello, if you know mr xxxx please tell him to return my photography gear as i have been trying to reach him and he is deliberately evading me! he borrowed my gear 10 days ago and he has not returned it. i need the gear badly and this is costing me too much. appreciate your help if you can help me contact him."" -- then i attach a photo of his identification card with his photo

can he really file a case against me?? he won't even answer my question when i asked him why is he evading me.",2

tl;dr overheard my wife talking about me as if i was dead, she said she was reading a book out loud

there were 2 edits to this op

1 - to clarify i don't believe this woman is capable of murder one

2 -  i looked through her browser history (not snooping, but details won't matter) and she is shopping for wedding dresses?

&#x200b;

update:

met a buddy for lunch and told him the whole tale. he too found it morbid af, but did't see her committing first degree murder. asked me if i thought she could be having an affair (he has a history with weird stuff turning out to be cheater so). suggested i get a pi in case of cheating, and call my lawyer in case of murder.

i said i'll consider it. but i know my wife, she is usually pretty shy. i'm still really thinking this might be something silly that got her embarrassed. was it any other topic, i'd have asked right away. the funeral thing just got me creeped out and i probably would leave it alone if not for my growing curiosity.

buddy makes a point that there is no harm in calling my lawyer just to check on the procedure to change beneficiaries on life insurance and such, so i'm prepared in the event things go even more weird. i agree, no harm in that. call the lawyer, tell him i'm discussing finances with the wife and we are thinking about changing both our beneficiaries (trying not to make it look like i suspect her, you know), he says he's stepping into a restaurant with a client can he call me back.

i move on with my work, have a long day, so, honestly, i forget about it.

when i get home late at night, my wife is *upset*. and that is an understatement.

i am quickly educated on two things that happened on her day:

1 - lawyer called. he wasn't able to get a hold of me anywhere else. was wondering what were the questions we had about changing the beneficiaries on life insurances. wife had no idea what he was talking about. he seemed uncomfortable upon hanging up.

2 - turns out my buddy talked to his wife (in confidence) and told her everything. his wife told a couple of close friends (in confidence) as well. and on it went until the gossip reached a friend of my wife's who actually knew what was happening. she called my wife and told her she should talk to me asap.

she is mortified. upset, hurt, confused, embarrassed. the whole deal. a little mad as well. maybe more than a little.

she tells me she joined a community theater, drama club, something, and will be playing a widow. the monologue is an acting exercise to tap into emotions. (which btw is something many of you told me was a possibility, so thank you, you were right). her friend (the one who knew what was going on) was the one who convinced her it would be a good idea, to help her out with her shy personality.

she lied about it being a book because she too thinks it is a creepy thing to do, and didn't feel like sharing at the time, since the whole drama club is something she was doing for herself. but she thought i only heard her speaking, as in ""her voice"", not ""what she was saying"". had she known what i heard, she would have explained it.

i ask her why didn't she tell me about the drama club. she looks at me like i have no business asking her another question for as long as we both shall live, not even about the weather. but she says it is ""her thing"" and she even made her friend promise not to mention it because she didn't want all of us at one of the plays (we are a tight bunch) until she was more comfortable on stage.

i say she could have just told me, to which she replies with something like ""are you telling me that you can keep something private that happens in our household to yourself without bringing all our friends into it?""

after the latest events i don't have an answer for her.

but i'm still missing a piece of the puzzle. so i ask ""what about the wedding dress?"".

this is when i realize this part of the story didn't reach her yet. she asks me ""what"" and i have the pleasure of telling my wife i went through her personal computer.

**now** she is homicidal.

grabs me by my shirt, drags me up to our closet and shows me ""the wedding dress"" (in the making) for the play. it is amateur theater, so they have more than one job and she is also helping with the costumes, wardrobe, whatever it is called. she was looking online for cheap dresses or for styling ideas to make her own (she is quite skilled in making clothes and such, and the search history did say ""old"" or ""vintage"" wedding dress). she also shows me nun's clothes and a pirate's in her closet and asks me if that means she is attacking the british. by now i am just wondering what the fuck is this play about? a bride, a pirate and a nun? who the fuck is writing this shit? but i'm guessing i shouldn't be talking anymore.

she is pissed that i would think she is capable of murder enough to call our lawyer, that i told all our friends about her embarrassing monologue and went through her personal computer. not to mention ruining the drama club she was enjoying.

i just nod, apologize profusely, try to explain that things didn't happen quite like that, and show myself to the guest bedroom because we both know where this is going.

she then tells me i can't even sleep there. since my brother and his wife will be staying with us for a few days, she already changed the sheets and had everything cleaned and ready and says ""you will just make a mess""

so last night i had the privilege of sleeping on the couch.

&#x200b;

tl;dr wife was practicing my eulogy, turns out it was a play. i got to sleep on the couch and am currently hoping she wont file for divorce.

&#x200b;

edit just to be safe: i realize i took some liberties with my writing.

just to make it clear: i think she was more upset with the version of the story that reached her than the actual facts. it will take her a moment to process the stuff (what actually happened) i told her. also, she didn't use any literal physical violence against me. that was just bad writing on my part.

you all be good, you wonderful people

edit 2:

people calling it bullshit made me smile. people saying the fact i didn't answer to those calls proves that it is bullshit made me smile some more.

i mean no disrespect, but i have a job, guys.

look, i had a weird problem and i want to say ""thank you"" to everyone who took a few moments of their days to help a stranger. i was creeped out and you all truly helped, so thank you!

to the ones asking for more details... i mean, i could say my wife is a pilates instructor who has most of her day to herself, that our study is a mess of fabric and half made clothes so she could be working on costumes for the whole cirque du soleil and i would still be oblivious, i could answer every single question you all have until my fingers went raw, but let's face it: it would be pointless. and i would have to share more personal details than i am comfortable with. i even mentioned on comments i kept some details (and people) out of the story for this very reason.

so thank you to the ones who believed me enough to help, i read all the comments, though i couldn't answer them all. this update was for you, since i received more help than i thought i would, when i first posted. you guys were amazing.

thank you to the ones who called it bullshit as well, you guys keep this sub in check. it's part of the ride.

"my (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22m) tried to spike my drink.. this is a throwaway, my boyfriend also has a reddit account. i am sorry for how long it is but please read this, i need advice. 

updates at the bottom of the post.

i have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now and started hanging out with his friends, all guys, a few months after we started going out. there is usually at least 4 of us at one of our places, drinks, snacks and music every friday evening. my boyfriend is out of town for the weekend and the guys invited me anyway. we were at the friend in question's place, let's call him s. s has always been very nice to me, a bit flirty in the beginning but i just brushed it off and it didn't last long anyway. he plays guitar and i play instruments as well so we always show each other our compositions.

so yesterday when i went to his place, there was another friend and everything seemed fine, we were drinking and hanging out until around 1 am when other friend says he's heading home as he works on saturdays. not wanting to make anything awkward and as everyone was a bit buzzed, i say i should leave too to talk to my boyfriend and let him know i'm home okay. s says i should stay a bit more as he wants to show me the last piece he wrote, i agree and sit back on the couch. s brings his guitar then asks if i want something else to drink, i tell him i am okay and he insists he has an amazing whisky that i need to try, he then goes to the kitchen to bring it. in the mean time, i start heading for the toilet and catch a glimpse of him dropping something in my drink, it dissolves and he smells the glass, i quickly close the toilet door before he could notice me. now i was tipsy but still very aware of my surroundings, and i am 100 percent sure of what i saw. he brought the two glasses and kept watching me, not knowing what to do i ""accidently"" dropped it, apologized profusely and said i should really head home and l started heading for the door. s grabs my arm and is very insistant i should stay, he keeps telling me i should spend the night, how my boyfriend doesn't need to know, that i am really hot and how horny he is. i push him and run to the door then call an uber and head home.

i don't know what to do from here, i couldn't sleep all night and i keep imagining worse case scenarios. i don't know if i should tell my boyfriend or if he would even believe me and how he would react, i haven't heard from s yet and i don't know if i can even look him in the eyes. all i know is i am not going to be able to act normally and i am sure my boyfriend will know something is wrong. i really need some advice.

edit: update actually, thank you for the comments, the advie was very appreciated. i called my boyfriend and told him everything. he believes me and he was very supportive over the phone but hr is very upset, he says i should have told him right away and that he's coming back to ""beat the shit out of him"" and insists we go to the police. this is basically what i was afraid of, i am pretty sure he's going to go to s's place directly, he is 2 hours away. and i can't stop him because it's not like i can go there myself, but at least he says he is here for me.

second edit, another update: thank you all for the wonderful advice and support. we're going to the police station, i am writing this on our way, i am terrified and it's late, this has been a tough day but my boyfriend has been amazingly supportive although he is very angry. we agreed that we wouldn't contact him directly and bf said he would call his other friends to let them know after we talk to the police. this is going out of proportions and i am honestly shaking while writing this but i hope this is the right choice. i am still scared to ruin someone's life over this and i don't know if anything will be done but you guys were right to open my eyes that he might have done it to someone else or will in the future. my bf is very adament on taking it in his own hands if the police don''t do something so i hope they can and i will make another post when an update is necessary. thank you again, i would not have done this without the support here.",7
"is it wrong of me to ask for proof of a pregnancy?. my girlfriend f28 and have been i m21 a very rocky place in our relationship. i tried to break up with her a couple of weeks ago and she told me that she was pregnant, the day before this we went to bar crawl and both drank. she has displayed manipulative tendencies before and she freaks out calling me terrible for asking her to take a test. 

am i in the wrong for wanting to see proof with my own eyes?

update: she still has not taken a test, we had two scheduled before and she backed out, first with sending me bloody paper towels saying she's spotting. the day before the test she says there isn't a point to go anymore. 

a few days later she gets mad i don't give her a ride from her job saying, ""you're letting a pregnant woman take the bus?"" when i asked why she said there wasn't a point she replied, ""i didn't know if i wanted to keep it."" 

the second time i made an appointment but she said she wouldn't go because she hadn't heard of this place before. 

we have one this saturday but we got into a bad argument last night because someone who messaged me claiming to be her husband said she was 35 not 28, when i confronted her she freaked out for a couple days then she admitted she was 35. this was a week ago and she gets mad i bring it up saying i make her feel terrible about her age. 

the man also sent some photo's including a fake pregnancy test box. she says he is out to ruin her life but he lived with for the first 5-6 months that we dated. 

her biggest claim to not taking a pregnancy test that she had a miscarriage in oct. when i was on a vaction. so she felt telling me or anyone would jinx it.

a big thing i would like to point out is i'm not perfect,  i can honestly claim to never have been a good boyfriend.

"for having sex with my sister in law on the wedding night.. hey reddit,

i was best man for my brothers wedding, the maid of honor was his brides sister.  i am 24m while the sister (katie) was 20f.  we really hit it off right away.  we study the same subject in school, shes witty and funny and we got along really well.

day of the wedding my brother and dad pull me aside and give me strict orders not to talk or initiate anything with katie.  i said that would be hard as we literally walk up the aisle together.  he said that was fine but other than that no contact, he then turned to me and said ""this is my day, i can tell you like her by the way you guys, stop being so selfish bro and be a good brother for once in your life"" this shocked me as we had a good relationship but i get he was stressed.

wedding was going well and i obeyed them for the first part of the day, she wanted to dance but i said no.  she looked hurt and confronted me when i was getting a drink.  she said ""we were having so much fun before the day of the wedding, what changed?  i really like you and want to get to know you better, do you feel the same way""?  i said yes, and apologized and we danced.  

my dad forcibly tried to pull me off the dancefloor but i ignored him,  i got a text from my brother during the party that i was not to talk to her.  i replied dude wtf i get its your day but whats the deal?  we ended up making out after my brother left with his bride to the hotel.  we went back to the hotel holding hands, and laughing and we finally kissed.  well we had sex in my room and i got her number and we are going to have a real first date this week.

i got a text from my brother later that day that his new wife told him what happened and he was extremely angry and couldn't believe i was so selfish.   my dad threw a fit when he found out and said he won't pay for my wedding when it happened.  i told him idc because i have a good job now.  i feel bad tho, did i ruin the day for my brother aita?",3

"by almost having a gay threesome with my cousin and his husband.  

didn't happen today, on mobile, throwaway account etc.

my job requires me to travel a lot between the usa and canada - i have a 50/50 client split between the two places, so although i am based in los angeles, i fly into toronto every few weeks.

all of my family and friends are also in la, and i'm from a very conservative background, so when i realized at about age 12 that the thought of both girls and boys made me want to fiddle with my diddle, i kept the latter quiet to avoid being disowned by my father or giving my mom a heart attack. i've had plenty of girlfriends before and they're happy, i'm happy and there's no need to change that. anyway.

i headed out to toronto last friday morning for a few meetings. every now and then, i'll have meetings friday and monday, so i'll stay the weekend and have a little bit of a holiday in a nice hotel somewhere.

at about 4pm on friday, i had finished my work, checked into my hotel and was feeling a bit horny. anyone in the bi community will know it's easier to pickup guys then girls, so i downloaded grindr, created an account, uploaded a few pictures (without my face - half because i'm ugly and half because i don't want to be recognized) and did some browsing. some 20ish minutes in - i got a message. this guy was about my age, didn't have a picture, but gave me a description of himself and he sounded like a good way to spend my friday night.

we start to make a plan for 7pm and he mentions he's married and asks if i'd be interested in his husband coming along and having a little threesome action. now a threesome wasn't on my to-do list, but i'll give anything a go once so i said what the hell.

anyways, it comes around to 6:30pm and i get a call. i have two sim cards in my phone (one from canada and one from the usa). it's my cousin who lives in canada. i only speak to this guy probably 2-3 times a year, so it's a little weird, but not any cause for concern or anything and i was a bit busy at the time with some prep, so i let it go to vm. 60 seconds later, a txt. from my cousin:

&#x200b;

*""hi it's xxxxx from grindr. we're 2 minutes away, ok if we're a bit early?""*

&#x200b;

it took me about 30 seconds, but it clicks. canada. gay married cousin. the description matches. holy fucking shit, i just organised a threesome with my cousin.

i sat there in the bathroom, trying not to have a panic attack for a few minutes until my phone rings again. now obviously i'm not going to answer it, and i'm just praising god that i gave him my canadian number over grindr that he didn't have, and that i had him saved in my phone. the room phone begins to ring as well. holy shit.

i swear to god, i have never put on clothes so fast and bolted down 30 floors of stairs so fast. at the bottom of the staircase, i was straight through that fire door and hid in the nearest mcdonalds for the next 4 hours. 14 missed calls (10 from my cousin, 4 from hotel reception) and i took the sim card out of my phone and snapped it in half. found a new hotel room that night just in case. have to come up with an excuse for work and my clients as to why i need a new canadian number, but i think it was better than the other option...

"by blowing my man too enthusiastically nsfw. this happened the past night, technically already today.

we were having some adult fun with the boyfriend. it was also after a couple of drinks so we were going at it pretty rough.
so here i am, on my knees, giving him a blowjob, putting my back into it when all of a sudden i hear a very loud *pop* immediately followed by one of the worst pain i ever felt. it felt as if someone stabbed me in the face with a screwdriver. 

thanks to my godlike reflexes i was able to yank my head away from the one eyed yogurt slinger before my teeth snapped together and with that momentum i also managed to slam my head into the nearest wall. i was already in tears from the shock of the sudden pain when i realised.. i can't move my jaw. i started to panic and just kept repeating ""i can't open my mouth! i can't open my mouth!"".

we tried to pry it open while under hot water, thinking it was a muscle cramp but that shortly, with some pain i can't even start to describe, revealed that it indeed was not just some stiff muscle... 

yup, i managed to dislocate my jaw while giving a blowjob.

in a futile attempt to snap it back where it belongs, i tried punching myself in the face on the opposite side, tried pushing it, pulling it with all my might but none of that seemed to work. at the end after many tears and pain and panicked running in circles, i took a painkiller and wrapped myself in a blanket to think through my options. i ended up falling asleep like that for a few hours. 

when i woke again, with the pain a bit duller and my mind a bit clearer i finally managed to pop my jaw back where it belongs but the pain is still very bad and i can't open my mouth more then to fit a teaspoon neither can i close it completely. it being sunday, only emergency trauma care is accessible in the hospital and it is insanely crowded so i decided to wait till tomorrow to seek medical attention. so here i am now, popping painkillers and eating my dinner with a straw, having absolutely no idea what i am going to say to the doctor or how do i explain to my boss why i need a day off in such short notice.

tl,dr: i went for a blowjob, ended up like the t-rex after king kong was done with it.

edit/update: first of all... holy sh** this blew up! i'm glad i could make so many of you chuckle. also, i've read the comments, thanks for the laughs, it hurt.

to answer a couple topics i found in the comments: sadly, nobody came that day. 

what was boyfriend doing, well, he tried to call an ambulance after he realised we are not equipped to fix the issue. problem is, my country is not very big on english and my boyfriend doesn't speak the local language. first operator hang up on him when realised he is trying to communicate in english, second operator got stuck on not understanding the address code in english... i then insisted to ""f**k that, it'll be fine"".

i am not from the us, just very stupid. health care is included in taxes but did not rush to the er because they are under staffed, under payed and over worked an i was not bleeding, seriously disabled or in mortal danger, neither did i think a dislocated jaw is serious enough to require immediate care, tho reading your horror stories and warnings made me concerned.

after a brief ~4 hours spent at the clinic i was called into a large room where five dentists were working on five different patients with not as much as a curtain separating them so the place was loud enough that the doctor did not ask questions because i was not able to answer loud enough. he instructed me to grip the chair tight because it will hurt, pushed my jaw backwards and wiggled it to it's place. showed me how to stretch the muscles, gave me his number and sent me off.

hopefully it will heal alright and i can go back to finish what i was doing originally.

i know the answer to ""can my work fire me for....."" is almost always yes in the u.s., but this seems really wrong.

&#x200b;

i'm a phlebotomist in a hospital in pennsylvania. i report to the laboratory supervisor. recently i had to have some tests done. we are given a discount for having things that like done in our own hospital so of course i did. for medical privacy, i'd prefer not to go into what exactly, but it turned out i have something rare about my blood. i never told anyone this at work, but everyone found out anyway. my supervisor approached me excitedly, saying that they have to calibrate some kind of analyzer pretty frequently and that my blood worked as a positive control to save on some expensive chemical they have to buy to normally calibrate it. i laughed this off thinking she used my blood once to calibrate her machine. it turns out she is expecting to take my blood on a regular basis (at least weekly is the impression i got) to calibrate this machine. when i told her i wasn't ok with that, she got upset and stormed off to her office. she called me in later and told me i would be saving the lab a ton of money if i did this. i once again told her no. now she has started dropping hints that the lab is in financial trouble and cuts will have to be made. i asked around to other phlebotomists and she hasn't said anything to them about these cuts.

"for making my pregnant daughter move out before the baby is born?. my 17 yo daughter (youngest and we had her late) is 7 weeks pregnant (she will be 18 by the time she gives birth) she is not in a relationship with the father. he reeaallyyy, i can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. i honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.

she has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. after she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby i asked her how she is going to manage that? this was the jist of the convo:

her: i'll get a job. 
me: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? 
her: i thought you and dad could.
me: absolutely not, i'm not raising another baby.

pretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, i'm practically going to be its mother. i'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how i want to spend my retirement years. it's not fair to us. so i told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live. husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing, i love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but i feel like we need to be united on this. i just want to know if  i'm in the wrong here.

edit: to everyone acting like i'm spending the next 7 months ignoring her- i will help her get a job, get on assistance if need be, find affordable housing etc. i just will not raise this baby.",3

if you don't want to read it, here's the summary...i believed my wife to be having an affair with a coworker who had repeatedly appeared in her pictures and conversations. so, one happy hour, i followed her. even though i had seen nothing definitive, i confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.

believe it or not, i listened to your advice. i received extensive advice from both sides. publicly, everyone agreed i was at fault. in my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. regardless, i sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, brandon. i told her i did not feel as attractive as brandon and worried that as i was getting older, her interest in me was waning. i also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. i apologized for following her and told her i would never do it again.

she told me several things. first, that she was offended i did not trust her. second, that she did suspect brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. the thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.

she also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. she reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.

so, what of our future? i asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after i had followed her. she joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. she told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (java, specifically). i haven't told her yet, but i plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that i never heard of until researching...

"by ruining my valentine's date with my girlfriend. so my girl and i had a great night planned. i made reservations at her favorite restaurant. she got a sexy little number to wear for ""after dinner"" and sent me teasing texts all day. she absolutely loved the flowers i got her, and she presented me with a bouquet of homemade beef jerky. she then proceeded to spend, i kid you not, 3 hours getting ready.  she looked friggin' amazing though. we were both starving and she was really looking forward to a night out. 

so we get to the restaurant and get seated. the only menu they give us is this valentine's day special. i do some quick mental math and realize *this dinner is going to cost me close to $300.* 

oh. hell. no. 

so my gf looks up from the wine list and sees i am antsy. she asks what's wrong. i mumble something about their prices having gone up. she asked if i wanted to go somewhere else and i jumped on it. practically raced out of there. she followed along and sheepishly made excuses to the wait staff. 

so we get back to the car and i apologized and told her $300 was ridiculous for one dinner and she was like ""wait? what? it wasn't that much"" 

turns out the menu prices were *per couple* not per person like i had thought. 

once i realized that dinner would in fact have been in my budget. i tried to get her to go back to the restaurant. this is where i *really* fucked up. she kept saying no and that she didn't want to. she said she would be too embarassed to go back. i said that was ridiculous and i didn't understand why and i kept trying to get her to go back. then she suddenly burst into tears and sobs ""why. aren't. you. listening? it doesn't matter why all that matters is that it does. why do you want to push me into something that makes me feel so uncomfortable?""

ah fuck. she kinda had a point. i apologize and drive her home. i asked if she wanted to go to any of the other restaurants on our route home. she said no since she ""looked like shit"" since her make up got all messed up from crying. (she didn't. she still looked gorgeous) 

we get home and i don't think anyone on the face of the planet has ever gotten changed from fancy clothes to sweats as fast as she did. i tried apologizing again, she said it was ok but she just wanted to be alone for a while. 

now she and the cat are in the other room watching true crime documentaries. 

tl;dr i ruined date night by thinking the restaurant was over priced and leaving (it wasn't) then not listening to her. now girlfriend and cat are probably plotting how to get away with my murder.

edit/update: thank you all so much for this information. a little more info on our full situation. my husband and i live in  alaska in a more remote area and it was just the two of us. he died while running a 10k and i saw him about 3 minutes before and he was ecstatic and smiling and gave me a thumbs up. both of our families live in new mexico, so i will be moving back there. the boat was just a pleasure boat we'd use on the ocean and luckily it's a very sought after boat in this state so it should move quickly. we have one truck that is paid off and i will be selling that and keeping my subaru. i went ahead and canceled all of the auto payments on his credit cards and i've already begun paperwork on ira's and the life insurance policy. i'm fortunate that my family has means and are able to help me right now. my parents arrived the day after he died and his dad and sister arrived tuesday night, so i have a wonderful support network. i have about 13000 liquid with about 7000 more coming in so i'll be able to make the mortgage payment, car, etc. while we're waiting to clear things out. the esop is not paid out until a year after the event and my dad has already contacted his financial advisor to help me navigate what to do with the money as well as not to be hit hard with taxes. i'll also be able to receive his permanent fund dividend this year which is good since i guess it's supposed to be a whopper. i feel so fortunate that we somewhat had our shit together. my husband and i were both socking money away into our retirement accounts and we had a modest home so we could have lots of adventures, which we did. we lived without regrets and that is really helping me right now. well i guess i slightly misspoke, i wish we did have more life insurance, but hindsights always 20/20. if anyone can learn anything from my situation it is this: life is fleeting. live everyday to the fullest. my husband and i went on adventures nearly every weekend. whether it be hiking, backpacking, bike-packing, boating, fishing, hunting, traveling, we were always doing something. we told each other numerous times a day that we loved each other and we were each others world. i will get through this and i will continue to accomplish the goals that we shared together. life through me a shitty surprise, but it's not the end of the world. i will get better. my beloved loved to tell me to get my shit together when i was being a whiny pants and that's just what i'm going to do. also, because i'm selfish in my grief and if anyone is interested to learn more about my amazing husband(https://www.sewardjournal.com/eedition/page/page_643cb6a9-a712-5261-8d3f-323e2b159dae.html), i wrote a letter of thanks and it's been published in two papers.",10

we've been able to save about 400 a month, and with just eating out less (we go out out 40ish once a week and probably 3-4fast/cheap takeouts each week) well recoup some money to the tune of 100 bucks a week. we'd have more discretionary income if i stopped putting renovations in the house, but not a lot... a new spigot here, a paint job there... i redid the floors in hardwoods recently and still have moldings to buy and install. the new (5 month old) privacy fence needs stained. it's all ( relatively) little stuff and i save a small fortune by turning my own wrenches on the cars, fixing my own plumbing/electrical/interior stuff. 

 we've got a couple grand in savings which i know isn't enough; in fact that number represents slightly less than what my wife nets in a month at her hourly job. of course theres maternity to think about too- complete job security but its unpaid due to her lack of tenure.

"timeshare ownership is never a good financial idea.. i see on reddit a some comments about how owning timeshares ""can be a good deal"" and thought it was prudent to point out this is just not true in any evidence i could find. they are a really predatory and deceptive business whether resale or points based and especially when bought from the developer. let's go through the options if you **own** a timeshare:

* you buy from a developer/direct -

they immediately decrease in value if bought from the developer, sometimes to literal worthlessness or even negative value. every. single. timeshare. decreases. i don't care if it's disney vacation club or whatever the salesperson told you. you buy it from the developer and you just wasted tens of thousands of dollars. check ebay if you don't believe me or literally any of the resale sites. you just lost thousands of dollars. find a single one that has increased in value vs inflation, post the link and i'll buy the first person gold. even dvc which is considered the most valuable timeshare currency sells for under initial purchase value when accounting for inflation.

* you buy/gifted from a reseller/family member -

let's say you get it for literally zero dollars on ebay. pretty sweet right, free vacation? wrong. maintenance fees will be very expensive. at least 500-800$ yearly. so you are paying 500-800 a year, to hopefully go on vacation to the same place at the same time (if the word ""points"" just jumped into your brain, go to the next paragraph).  this may be a discount of 0%-50%. so this is the one thing i will conceded this may provide you with a *small* discount. so a small discount to have a liability and complete lack of flexibility in a vacation is a terrible financial tradeoff. people that post that ""the same room/condo would be 5k that week!"" are always quoting the developers ""stated rate"" which is not market at all and basically made up. give me an exact example if you think i'm wrong along with screen shot of your maintenance fees and again, gold to the first person.

* ""but 16semesters, i get points! i have plenty of flexibility""

points are garbage. garbage. they oftentimes include an additional fee to use a different resort. no matter what the salesperson told you, there *are* byzantine rules on dates, switching out, etc. they are restrictive and expire after *at most* 3 years. they sell for fractions of their ""value"" on resale sites. why would points be selling for so little on the resale market if they are such good deals? wouldn't it be prudent to just buy the points at a significant discount and use those instead? let me know your company your timeshare is through and i can promise i'll find points well below ""retail"".

a lot of people also get second hand information on these things from family members that may be inaccurate or outdated so i'd caution passing off ""well my aunt only pays x"" unless you've seen some proof.  it's okay if you've been scam by a timeshare or someone in your family has. i've been scammed on other scams before, it doesn't make you stupid. i write this post on the personal finance subreddit so that people can be informed moving forward. if anyone has disagreements or something i missed let me know.",10

"playing porn for my family through the echo on xmas morning. writing this from the bathroom as i just realized what happened. 

home for the holidays. my family got an amazon alexa a couple of years ago, and my parents never quite figured out how to actually make it work. it used to be set up under my account, but when i moved out last year i transferred everything to my mom. it's in the kitchen, and she mostly uses it for timers while cooking. 

our family likes off-beat christmas music, and i spent a while some time back curating it all on to a special spotify playlist for us. we like to listen to it as we have brunch and open presents on christmas morning. 

here's where the fu starts. yesterday i wanted to play a new song i heard for my mom. i couldn't get the echo to find it, so i had to connect my phone via bluetooth. the family all got new phones a month ago, so there were no devices automatically connected. i paired my phone and played the song. 

this morning, before a long day of family, small talk, presents and whatnot, i was mentally preparing myself for the day in my childhood bed. you know, relieving some stress.... with videos. oddly enough none of the videos i stumbled upon had sound. i wrote it off as shoddy sources and finished the deed. 

when i came downstairs to say good morning and merry christmas to the family, my sister greets me with ""you need to play the playlist from your phone, i can't get the echo to connect to my phone."" ""okay, no problem, i'll connect my phone."" ""i was trying to connect mine, and i think yours is already connected.""

not sure what my family heard playing over the echo this morning, but it wasn't my usual christmas playlist. 

tl;dr paired my new phone to my family's echo yesterday. went to tug one out this morning in my childhood bed, and i'm pretty sure that soundtrack blasted in the kitchen for my family. ",4
"is there any validity to the claim that epsom salts ""increase the relaxing effects of a warm bath after strenuous exertion""? if so, what is the underlying mechanism for this effect?. this claim is printed in wide type on this box of es we've got & my baloney detector is tingling.

edit/update: just a reminder to please remain on topic and refrain from anecdotal evidence and hearsay. if you have relevant expertise and can back up what you say with peer-reviewed literature, that's fine. side-discussions about recreational drug use, effects on buoyancy, sensory deprivation tanks and just plain old off topic ramblings, while possibly very interesting, are being pruned off as off-topic, as per sub policy.

so far, what i'm taking of this is that there exists some literature claiming that some of the magnesium might be absorbed through the skin (thank you user /u/locused), but that whether that claim is credible or not, or whether the amounts are sufficient to have an effect is debatable or yet to be proven, as pointed out by several other users.",9

"for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?. every summer my community has a cookoff competition. usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. it's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. this year it was pasta sauce. i've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and i moved here but this is the first time i entered as a competitor. it was earlier today.

one of the other competitors, i know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with asperger's syndrome and autism. i don't know much about this condition evidently. i'll call her jessica. i guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. we've never had this before as far as i know.

to make the story short, i won the competition. and $1,500. there's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. my wife and i were in shock because i like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? we were tickled pink. 

we celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. you might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to jessica as a ""gesture of good will"". they said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. we obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. so they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with jessica. likewise we said no.

i guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. after a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.

we had to leave and haven't collected our winnings yet. we're meant to tomorrow from the mayor's office. i can't even imagine what's going to happen tomorrow.

are we the assholes for not splitting our winnings with a disabled child for a cooking competition?",3

in april 2018, it looks like a credit card was opened in my name with the address of my former house, where we lived while we were together. i had literally no knowledge of the card or anything about it. the first i learned of it was last week when i was served and given a court date in july. i'm being sued by the credit card company for the balance and lawyer fees. looking through the documents, it's clear as day she was the one who opened the card. i texted her telling her she needed to pay it and she at first acted like she didn't know what i was talking about. she finally admitted that she opened the card because she felt that i was still responsible for upkeep on the house and her car after the alimony ended. she said her mom told her it would be fine.

"a realtor is selling my house without my permission, what should i do?. we bought it 2 years ago and found out about it being sold on the internet only a few hours ago. we don't know how long the ad has been up but it's not on the site of the realtor we bought it from... any advice?

**edit: ok... time to disappoint a lot of people.**

first of all, thank you to everyone here for the overwhelming response we had. a lot of great and precious advice.

i have to clarify a few things as well:

- this isn't happening in the us. sorry. sorry. i'm sorry. when i posted this on here i didn't realize that it was based in the us, we wanted as much advice as possible. all the time you spent writing advice wasn't wasted though, because it seems mostly applicable here too; the terminology is just different.
- as a few of you pointed out, no one is ""selling"" my house without my permission. it's just a listing. still worrying but not as much as the title implies i guess.
- i am not behind the ""scam"" (if this turns out to be one). i'm not a realtor and i don't think posting about it on reddit would be the greatest idea.

now for the update part: from what i've read across the 250 or so comments in my inbox (haven't gone through all the replies yet), this could be one of 3 things (from less likely to most likely):

- an actual scam. someone is trying to forge documents to gain ownership of the house or something. i haven't really understood the whole process of this one but it's still possible.
- a bait & switch listing, used to get interested people to call to visit the house. then the realtor tells them it's not available right now but ""here are some other houses we can take a look at"". we think this one is what is actually happening. they might be taking (or keeping) old ads on their website just to have a good quantity of them so people come.
- an error. honestly the most likely. the pictures are from 2 years ago when we bought the house. the house is not currently for sale anymore and someone could have forgotten to take the ad down. the price is the same as when we bought it too. 

all in all, this is probably just a fun ride and we're not likely to lose our house that way (thanks for pointing that out, it's reassuring).

we will call the realtor as potential buyers, saying we're interested and want to visit the (our) house. if they remove the ad it was just a mistake. if they answer offering to take a look at other houses we will send a formal letter asking to remove the listing. same thing if we don't get an answer.

either way, i will keep this post updated.

ps. i realized that this should have been posted on r/legaladvice instead. i don't think i can just move the whole thing now but if the mods want to remove it because it breaks the rules i'm ok with that..

thanks again for all the replies, advice and to everyone who shared their experience! see ya in ""edit 2"" probably

"i(30f) am scarred by hearing so much about my fiance's (30f) past sex life because we have issues with sex. is it normal to have heard extensive details about your partners past lovers? i know about the random guy who ran into her on her bike whom she ended up fucking, the guy from work who was twice her age whom she wanted to have sex with so bad but he wouldn't fuck her as much as she wanted, her old boyfriend who could get her off 5 times in a row (i've gotten 2 out of her just once), the boys dorm where she made her way up and down the hallways, the married guy who she had a one night stand with, etc. etc. there are so many i can't even remember them all. now, i'm constantly comparing myself to them and wonder why her libido isn't that high with me.

i am one of a handful of women my partner has been with. we just got engaged about a month ago (yay!) and have been together for a year and a few months, but this is an issue that concerns me for our future. for the majority of the time we have been together, sex has been an issue. she has a hard time with me initiating and usually turns me down. she has conveyed this is because sex for her isn't about love, it makes her feel trapped and like i want something from her. i've gotten to the point where i get severe anxiety about initiating and we have gone from having a lot of sex (like 5-6 times a week) to having sex sometimes just once a week. even when we do, i usually feel anxious about it because i don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. there are also feelings of resentment for me around it now because it's always on her terms, i feel like when we do do it, she probably doesn't really want to, and also partly because (and this may be horrible of me) i struggle with worrying that she might just be with me (a woman) because she has felt used by men. even just with kissing she struggles. at one point we were kissing and she jerked back and practically screamed at me how much she hates kissing me. almost immediately afterward she started saying she didn't mean it and trying to take it back, and i haven't heard it since, but still now when i kiss her i just feel like she's waiting for it to be over. it breaks my heart and i don't know how to fix all of this and remove the pressure that we now both feel around sex and physical intimacy.

"for going to the er for sucking dick. a couple months ago, it was date night with my bf and i was pumped to finally relax after a rough week. my boyfriend (who asked to be called magnum here 🙄 🙄so i'll refer to him as m) and i ended up making stuffed crust pizza. with grilled onions, sausage, and a fuck ton of cheese, it looks fucking amazing. so does m, so while waiting for it to bake, we head back to the bedroom to do things.

&#x200b;

after blowing him, i pulled off to swallow, but i couldn't -- my jaw was locked wide open!

&#x200b;

super embarrassed, i ran into the bathroom to get his cum out of my mouth. it was still stuck in the back of my throat, but i couldn't swallow or spit, so i tilted my mouth forward to allow his baby gravy to slowly drip out my mouth into the sink.

&#x200b;

we try everything—forcing my jaw shut with hands, aggressively wiggling it, massaging, praying to jesus to forgive me for my premaritial sins, but it's still stuck wide open. trying to make a little more tolerable, i took ibuprofen with wine, dumbly forgetting i can't swallow. so there i was, choking on his semen, wine, pills, and drool uncontrollably flowing out of my mouth. to make matters worse, m eats the pizza in front of me, it smells delicious, and obviously i can't have any.

&#x200b;

at \~4am, we give up the home remedies and uber to the er. i attempt to explain my situation to the receptionist with my mouth wide open and drool dripping onto my shirt. she's probably like, ""why is this guy taking advantage of this poor retarded girl?"" i write down that i'm nauseous and worried i'll die from sucking dick and choking on my own vomit, and get seen pretty quickly. we end up with an audience of about \~5 other curious doctors while this guy inspects my jaw.

&#x200b;

one asks, ""how did this happen?""

me: ...

another doctor: ""did you yawn?""

me: ...uh...yeah...

🤦‍♀️

&#x200b;

one doctor massages my neck while the other one sticks his hands into my mouth and pushes my back teeth back. it hurts like a bitch—this guy's applying his whole body weight into my teeth and i can feel his arms shaking as he leans into me.

but then!! suddenly everything feels right again. it's all in place!!!

we go home and the pizza is still good the next morning, and everything is okay. well, besides having to send an er bill home to my parents and explain that it was from dislocating my jaw :( m looked awfully smug the whole time, but i appreciated him coming w me to the er and letting me drool all over him

tldr: dislocated my jaw by sucking dick. i had to go to the er at 4am, watch my bf eat the pizza we made together when i couldn't, and publicly humiliate myself

i feel like i'm violating her trust on the one hand, on the other hand, she is posting these letters to a public forum where anybody can see them. 

she forgot to log out of her account one day so i noticed the username and didn't think much of it at the time. thought maybe it was one of my kids friends who had used our computer then got distracted back with whatever i was doing. 

then one night i'm scrolling through unsent letters and i see this username, so i read the letter, and it's very clearly describing a situation between my wife and i. 

so i go into the post history and i learn a lot of things. feelings she has for an old boyfriend (who she's found reasons to meet up with twice and nothing's happened, though part of her would like something to) chief among them. 

i want to broach this subject with her, get all these problems out in the open, work through them. i don't want her to feel as though i violated her trust though. i'm caught.

"for telling an infertile woman that ""fur babies don't count""?. alt account. ya boy done gone made a massive whoopsie. 

basically i 20m recently started a job where i have mostly female coworkers. amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. they go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. there is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. she refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so i assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. however, friday i asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which i get bc i love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. when she later complained again about not being invited to something i kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, i don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. obviously i feel *awful* now, i didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. still i'm saved a little by the fact that i didn't know, right?

the following events transpired yesterday. spent last night in a&e, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.

me and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. very happy with our progress.

because we had been so disciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. a huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (i know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. 

we went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.

i awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. i could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. i waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as i sat down on the crapper and pushed, i felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. like it was being pulled apart from every angle. my girlfriend, who i had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking i was being murdered.

the worst part was that i couldn't exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my 'pincher' was now severely compromised. so i pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it's way out of my asshole. after about 25 minutes i had birthed the hellsnake. i only wish i had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.

a painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said i had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. apparently the turd was so fat and hard it'd literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.

sitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and i can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. 

for all you sickos:

dimensions: difficult to say. closer to randy's first record attempt than i would be comfortable disclosing.

courics: i don't know, i forgot to contact the european fecal standards team for verification. i would say more than one, less than four.

color: dark. i drink a lot of coffee.

texture: like a sock filled with broken marbles. 

tl;dr avoided bad food for months, gorged on pizza and nachos, gave birth to a baby sized turd that ripped my anal cavity open on its way out, resulting in the worst anal fissures my doctor had ever seen. ama

edit: i'm sorry reddit, i didn't take a photo. i wish i did. i wish i could go back in time and fix this...wait, no i don't. i don't want this to turn into a reddit fable where my compromised pincher is being spread between the dark corners of the web for the rest of time, so no i will not be squatting over a mirror and taking a picture of my anus. sorry. i also love my girlfriend too much to ask her to get in there with a camera; there's no use in two people being traumatized by this.

for all those sending get well messages and asking for updates: thank you sincerely. my girlfriend got over her anxiety and collected a cornucopia of stool softeners, numbing sprays, ice packs, and everything else imaginable. thank you all for the advice. she and the chemist shared a laugh when she showed her the story. how nice...",4

"by engaging with antivaxxers while grieving. obligatory this didn't actually happen today and i'm using a throwaway for reasons that will become clear below. a few months back, a young family member passed away unexpectedly. a social media post was put up about it, and it went viral. there were lots of kind people who commented nice and sometimes even helpful things, but there were also several with more maligned intentions: first spammers, then a few people who just wanted to speculate wildly about cause of death in very hurtful and insane ways, and then the anti-vax community descended on it.  the latter collectively wanted us to know that they ""knew"" what happened, that we could ""understand the tragedy"" better if we just talked to them. 

all of this was a lot to process in my grief, and i started going through comments and reporting them. my anger level rose and before long i convinced myself that if i just messaged them and told them that the autopsy showed something 100% unrelated, that they'd lay off. that we would maybe even get an apology. as i wrote the first message, i convinced myself that people are decent and they just misunderstood probably. i continued writing to a few others. 

yeah.... couldn't have been more wrong about that. i got back messages from each with different insane takes on it. then i started getting messages from other people i've never heard of. 

at the private, unannounced service, two women came up to me in the parking lot wanting to hug. i assumed they were from the other side of the family, people i'd met but i just wasn't immediately recalling them, so i obliged. they expressed their sorrow, asked a few questions, and then began explaining that they had ""research"" that they'd like to share. one pulled out pages of handwritten notes about the dangers of vaccinations and how it relates to the deceased. thankfully the employees of the funeral home helped me dispense of them quickly at least. 

i continued getting messages on social media and later learned that my info had been spreading from one social media group to another along with the any details they'd gleaned about the death from me. i eventually started getting phone calls even, though my phone number isn't out there in any easy to find place.  one person went to the length to write up over 20 pages of ""facts"" about the death including a section on how my loved one's death can further their cause politically. i couldn't even be mad; at least she was honest in her intention unlike the others. it's been months, and still i'm being hounded almost every single day by crazies all over the country. 

i've learned my lesson and don't respond or acknowledge them in any way now, nor have i for a while.  i haven't mentioned this to any of my family members because we're all so broken right now and this is way too much on top of it; i just hope none of them are getting the same treatment. 

tl;dr anti-vaxxers have been trying to ruin my life since i tried to reason with them after the passing of a loved one


edit - a few takeaways:
* to those that reached out with similar experiences, i have been mortified to learn that this wasn't unique to me. thank you for trusting me with your thoughts and stories.  i wish each of you the very best. 
* to those that reached out who have also lost a loved one recently, thank you. genuinely. that's a brave thing to talk about with a stranger online, and it's been really healing for me to have conversations with so many of you. 
* i regret the user name i chose for this post and the wording of my tl;dr. i do believe in vaccinating but am sad to realize my words were a catalyst in spurring so much hatred towards those who don't.  the people that doxxed me are on the extreme fringe of that group, and that has become even more clear to me reading comments and messages from some of you.  i'm going to try to parlay this whole experience of wishing for more kindness from strangers during a tough time to trying to be as kind as i can be to strangers (and everyone else for that matter),  online and otherwise.",4

""these are your cars now!"" and hands the man all the car keys. again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says ""everyone down here gets some cool cars! how would you drive around without having cars?"".

they walk on and the area gets even nicer. there are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.
they arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. she looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. the man couldn´t be any happier. the devil says ""everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

as they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. he peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. there are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. a stench of sulfur is in the air.

terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""what is going on there?""
the devil just shrugs and says: ""those are the christians, i don´t know why, but they prefer it that way""

"i feel like my job is becoming less worth it each year. here is the problem i'm having with my job. i like working here, but every year my responsibility level goes up and up. 5 years ago when i started, the job was busy but pretty good. however, now i'm the lead on projects, with people working under me, interfacing with customers, travelling internationally, solving problems on the floor, and reporting directly to senior management. the stress and the work have really ramped up in intensity with each passing year. the more senior you get, the worse it gets.

meanwhile, our compensation increases by 4-4.5% annually depending on a number of factors. it is always within this range until it caps after you reach the ceiling for the role. with inflation being around 2% annually, the real growth in compensation is about 2-2.5% annually. after 5 years, i am making about 23% more than my starting salary.

it really doesn't feel worth it anymore. during my last annual review i tried to ask for a larger increase, but was told that it simply doesn't happen. i have actually been thinking about leaving. if i can't find a higher paying role, would it be a reasonable thing to do to look for a lesser paying role with less stress and responsibility?

"if i don't disclose that i'm a product of incest to my present partner or potential future partners. i (22f) was adopted as an infant and never really knew much about my biological family since it was a closed adoption. i received infrequent letters and photos from my biological mother. i connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. i still really don't know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. however, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. i talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. i did some research, and was able to corroborate with dna testing that he is indeed my mother's first cousin. obviously that was shocking, and i feel like my existence was a mistake. i've been struggling with it. thankfully, from what i've read, there's very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and i don't have any medical issues. i do wear contacts, have adhd, generalized anxiety disorder and auditory processing disorder, and i'm prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). but none of these are major in the slightest and i live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. i'm in a relationship right now, i don't know how long it'll last or if it'll last. i would love to eventually marry him but i'm 22 and i'm  being a realist here. if i didn't tell him since there's virtually no chance our kids would have issues....and also i'm scared that he would break up with me because of it. 

also before anyone makes any kentucky/rolltide, my bio family is from ashland, ky. my life is a meme at this point

edit: i honestly did not think this would blow up so much. really glad this is a throwaway. i guess some info for people.

1. my mother didn't know she and my father were related. growing up she never knew her mother's side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. my parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn't a sexually abusive situation. they went to the same high school and they didn't look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (i think their mothers were siblings). mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, i think they my parents were 18-19 
because it was right after high school. 

2. boyfriend and i have been together about a year, which isn't long but i can see it leading to marriage. also he's not american, so no chance of us being related! trying to keep it out of the family. 

3. views of incest are a bit different here in america for you non americans. especially since i live in a very religious area, my family are strict catholics. it's not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.

**edit 2** this blew up like crazy and i was certainly not expecting it! i really appreciate all the kind words and reassurance!  ive been in my own head about this and i appreciate that so many of you are willing to offer advice!",3

"if women have the right to abort a child then people should have the right to voluntarily euthanasia. for example ""my body, my choice"", women (in the united states) have the right to abort a fetus if they decide if they don't want a child for either financial reasons or any other reasons they do not want to be mother for any other reason.

people that are going through depression should have the right to voluntarily euthanasia because they don't want to be alive anymore. the reason i am discussing this method of death is because imagine your suicidal struggling with mental illness and your only choices are the most gruesome methods of death such as a gun, (which gun laws are getting even stricter) and a rope, or other methods like allowing yourself to get hit by a car or train.
obviously if your struggling you don't what your family to come home to see your lifeless corpse hanging from the ceiling or your brains just simply splattered like paint all over the bedroom walls and ceiling. using someone else to kill you like a truck or train imho is just selfish and not morally right, imagine leaving a burden on them because they technically are the cause of your death and are charged with involuntary manslaughter.

another reason people should be entitled to euthanasia because the mental healthcare system in the us is a joke. take it from me, a person that's been having expensive therapy sessions for over 4 years with many different therapists and i admit i have tried suicide once which is what gotten me therapy in the first place. the second time i felt suicidal tendencies i called an anonymous hotline just to talk about feeling worthless and a few minutes later i had a bunch of squad cars at my door.

how come people on death row get euthanasia after the government spends more money housing and caring for inmates than the people in mental hospitals that's been suffering for years and wish for the sweet release of death?

my grandmothers brother had suffered from dementia in the last 2 years of his life in hospice, on some days he would smile upon seeing his sisters face and on the other days he would speak gibberish and start ranting. i'm sure he didn't understand the concept of what was going on his mind but i'm sure he begged for the mental and emotional pain to go away.

tl;dr:  women have the right to terminate an unborn child that's paid by our taxes but we don't have the right to voluntarily euthanasia. my body, my choice, ",6

edit: thank you all so very much for the great advice. i am going to contact the adult care tomorrow and a lawyer first thing on monday morning. i am a good person and will definitely consider becky in all final decisions. i intend to split the estate with her, but this is not my main concern. becky is ill herself and has taken advantage of my mom, however i do believe she loves her as a close friend. becky has made horrible choices and due to past family trauma i allowed this for many years because i just didn't have the capacity to deal. i am ashamed of this, but am now ready to buck up as becky doesn't have the mental sense or financial restraint to handle this on her own. thanks again!",2

what is your opinion on the moon?. ,1
"is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?. i have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. the moon**

>u/chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the earth, in the form of our moon. simulations (e.g. canup & asphaug 2001(https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), cuk & stewart 2012(https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. wiechert et al., 2001(https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly mars-sized) object collided with the proto-earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-mantle and proto-crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. a moon rock which is actually an earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a moon rock collected by the crew of apollo 14 was probably ejected from the earth about 4 billion years ago. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon(https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: in january of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from earth within it! this would make it an earth meteorite which struck the moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. this would have happened like a game of solar system pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the moon. radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in earth's 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the theia-earth impact event which formed the moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. you can read more on the details here(https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in earth and planetary science letters here(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0012821x19300202). 

**3. moldavite – rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. it formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite(https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. hydrogen and helium** 

>u/slowerthanlightspeed: ""jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric\_escape#jeans\_escape(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric_escape#jeans_escape)   
>  
>atmospheric escape of hydrogen on earth is due to jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\10\ the earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\10\ but a japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the earth.\11\ 

**also volcanoes apparently do not have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction(http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/knowanuknow : it's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. the most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. i thought krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of tnt. but even that isn't enough. it literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 hiroshimas (or 4 tsar bombs) and even that isn't enough. there's something called a verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verneshot(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verneshot)

"holding students back from leaving the classroom due to one student acting up causes them to hate the teacher, not the one student.. apparently my coworkers believe i should of held my class back today and not just the one student.

apparently the students would hate the one student for holding them up and not teacher.

i always hated that because i could hear the grumbles and mumbles of an angry students. and the anger is towards me and not the one student. 

i feel like it is better to escort my class to the lunchroom. and escort the one student back to my class. that one student will see and hear all of their classmates having a fun time in the lunch room. laughing, talking, goofing around, and trading food.

and be bummed sitting in the classroom alone and board with me. all i do is text my husband, go on reddit, and grade papers. that one student has to eat and think about their actions.

and after lunch my students get to run around and play on the playground. depending how disruptive the student was, i keep them in for 5 or 10 minutes.

during this time i make the one student clean desks, staple papers together, or other minor stuff. 

after they are done, i ask them if they understood why i kept them in. add a heart to heart chat. tell them i appreciate the work they did in my room today. and let them go.

but today my coworkers told me i am doing it wrong. i need to keep my whole class in. the students will hate that one student and the one student will feel guilty enough to stop. friends giving the friend the stink eye ensures that they won't act up again.

however 4/5 times the one student acting up is just part of a bigger problem. there could be stress at home that is causing them to act out. having them alone in my room, time to calm down, think things out, and a heart to heart talk shows them that this is a safe place to talk with a trusted adult. 

it could be something small like stressing out over the next test. or something big. i have had the toughest of bullies crying in my room because their parents are divorcing and they think it is all their fault.

i tried telling this to my coworker but they say if the student is really having trouble at home, they will to come to us for help.

i can't get half my students to admit when they need a pencil. i have one kid so shy he only speaks to me, the librarian, and his parents in whisper. took me five months for me to get him to nod yes and no to me in front of the other students.

i don't know where my co-workers are getting the outgoing students.

honestly, my shy student will be the only one happy staying in my room for lunch if one student acts up. but the rest will have the look of murder in their eyes. 

more so if it is friday and pizza is being severed in the lunchroom. hell if i hold my students up for a second on pizza day there will be a riot in my room. 

i been doing this since i first started teaching a couple years ago. then again, i am a young teacher. and my coworkers are a bit older. does experience have to do with it? will i change my mind when i am older? 

for now, my method works. my class average is above the rest of my coworkers. my students are happy in class. i have a couple of students i see during recess and after school that just need to talk some stuff out. 

unpopular opinion, i don't care. holding class back over one student is bullshit. i hated it when i was school, i hate doing it now.",6
"my boyfriend has a crush on my best friend.. okay, guys, i don't even know where to start this whole day has been a whirlwind. i apologize as this is going to be a long one. obligatory apology for formatting as i'm on mobile. 

last night my on/off boyfriend came (uninvited) to the bar i was at with my friends. he was clearly coked out and half-in-the-bag. the first thing he said to me was ""let me know if anyone here touches you, i'm in a fighting mood."" ?! what. i'm just trying to have a good night with my friends, why did he feel the need to show up here? 

a couple hours later, after many alcoholic beverages, me and my best friend decided to go over to his house with his friends for a night cap. stupid, i know. we ended up staying all night, i stayed over because i left my house keys in our dds car and my friend, i'll call her emilia, left late in the morning. 

in that time, him and emilia had had ""life chats"" and he had spent most of his time ignoring me to talk to her. at one point when we were both washing our faces to take off the days' makeup, he told her she had perfect skin and it didn't even look like she took anything off, looked at me in the mirror, then followed her back into his room. i have struggled with acne for almost ten years. i'm twenty now. he knows i'm insecure about my skin. 

anyways. after everyone else had gone home, i was left to take care of his drunk ass for hours until i finally just went out to the living room and fell asleep on the couch. i was rudely awakened moments later to him yelling on the phone, i asked him not once, twice, but three times to please talk in his room. he hung up and yelled at me saying i was keeping him from talking to his dad. ?! 

i got up and went back into his room and fell asleep. this time he woke me up telling me he needed to say something. ""look at me, *look* at me!"" then he tells me that he has a crush on emilia, keep in mind this is their first time ever hanging out, and that she is the only person who's ever listened to him or connected with him in that way. 

i can't stress enough how much i have done for this dude. we have been on and off for **three** years. i have stayed up all night with him during his coke binges and supported him through trying to get clean, listened to his endless rants, gave him a place to stay when he didn't have one, driven him to and from work for months when he didn't have a running vehicle, used my caa when his vehicles have broken down, picked him up in the middle of the night..... the list goes on and on. but i apparently have never listened to him or connected with him like emilia has. 

earlier this evening she texted me saying she hadn't even opened his message(https://imgur.com/a/zklrftu), i didn't even know he had messaged her. i honestly don't even know what to say about it, i'm kind of just baffled that three years of being together and all the time i've spent taking care of him has been all for not. that he can just throw it all away because he has a drunk crush on my *best* friend. 

here is the part where i ask you, dear redditors, for advice. what do i do? i've already broken up with him, blocked him on everything (then unblocked to tell him to get off my netflix), me and emilia will remain friends of course but, how do i cope with the fact that the person i thought would always have my back, dropped me for her? how do i keep myself from resenting her for it? she is one of my favourite people in this world, i know that this is 100% not her fault, i just don't want my emotions to take a toll on our friendship. lastly, what is the best way to move on? please share any stories you think would help or make me feel better. 

if you actually read this whole rant, thank you so, so kindly.

edit: he was not an addict when we started dating, the coke habit he picked up afterwards. i just didn't want to see him choose that path for himself and thought that i could help him, which i know now is beyond me.

edit 2: holy smokes. thank you guys so much for taking the time to read this and share your thoughts. i'm so sorry i can't reply to you all but i promise i am listening and share many of your opinions. i appreciate everything you have to say whether it is tough-love or no-love. 

to clarify some things: i dumped him! i am not mad at emilia, was just looking for advice so that i don't shift blame. we were dating when this happened and that is why i went to his house, when we were off we were vlc. emilia and i became friends last year through work and have lived in different cities the entirety of our friendship which is why they'd never hung out.

edit 3: here is my chance to profit. please send me your pet pictures!!! i need as many smiles as i can get and your sweet fluffy babies will bring me almost as much joy as they do you💗

edit 4: okay i promise i'm done editing after this but holy. smokes. gilded?! my reddit award cherry has been popped! this is nuts. i never expected this many people to read it, let alone respond or gild me. just a final thank you to everyone who's reached out and offered support. you are all beautiful people and have really helped me see the light in this situation.",7

"for firing employee of 20+ years for calling my niece ""princess"". my niece is kind of... a useless intern at the moment. she was super sheltered by her mother, my brother travels for work... so she has no real life skills.   
i own a business and took ally \18\ under my wing. she lives in my basement apartment \i live above her\ and i am pretty much building an adult from the ground up. everything from how to dress in the workplace to how to use a computer properly outside of facebook and instagram.   
it's working. it's just frustrating for ally because she should know a lot of this stuff. but her mom is very, very controlling. i expect i am going to do this with my other niece savannah when she graduates in a few years.   
but it's working out well. ally is going to start community college in september. but until then i am having her sit in my office and do various small tasks, take an online microsoft word tutorial, and catch up on various life goals.   
i have been running my own business for six years now. i took it over from my mother when she retired. my brother has no interest in the business, though he was offered some stake.   
my mother ran the business for 37 years before i took it over. she hired a woman named belladonna \54f\ who has worked there for 24 years. as such, belladonna feels she is pillar for the company and has asked to become a manager. she has tried to take on managerial roles before, but i wouldn't give her that job if someone paid me.   
she is a little snarky, but i had no issue with it. until i caught her calling ally ""cinderella"" and ""princess."" she was also ordering ally to get her coffee. when ally said she was working on something, belladonna told her ""well, i guess you just sit down and do nothing then.""   
i fired her on the spot.   
my mother thinks i was an asshole for doing that. but i don't tolerate people who think being older means they have a right to be snarky. i told people what ally was doing at the job, and that she was not an intern. she was simply my niece assisting me on stuff i needed help with.

"for telling my girlfriend her dream of moving to another country will never happen?. my (25m) girlfriend (23f) has always talked about how it's her dream to move to x country. she brought it up on our first date (we've been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

at the beginning, i went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if i would go with her, how crappy our current country is (i'm an expat and she's a local), etc etc 

recently, however, every few times she mentions it, i'll bring up her spending habits. in the time we've been together, she's spent around 8,000usd+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

the last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she'd need to save to get started. 

after we had the number, i started calculating something else. balenciaga shoes + lv bag + gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it's never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

she's called me ta, that i'm trying to control her money, i'm trying to humiliate her, make her feel ""small"" and it's none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing 

imo she could have made her dream come true long ago, and i was only trying to lay it out for her

the big edit: i texted him this morning and we talked about it, and everything is o.k. i feel like some of you guys are looking for a really dramatic and satisfying wrap-up but it was kind of not that big of a deal to him. i did make him laugh though because he wasn't expecting a conversation about his asshole first thing in the morning and he wants to see this post so apparently that's happening too. again, thank you for your help everyone besides the aforementioned people in my last edit. perhaps in another life i'll like assholes a little more. he might comment on this so if you scroll down you may or may not see some playful asshole banter between us below

my parents split up when i was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. my mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and i and stopped paying child support. he justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way i had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. about a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. however, today he asked if my sister and i could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which i had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. i rejected his request and told him i wasn't ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and i suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. after rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said i was murdering him. some of my friends also said i should forgive him because he is my father and that i am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. so aita?

"update virginia - i caused an accident, lady i hit refuses to take payout from insurance, thinks i should pay because i need to ""learn my lesson"". original thread here - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/612803/richmond_va_i_caused_an_accident_a_year_and_a/

the lady i hit, for several weeks, refused to take the (verbally) agreed upon settlement and my insurance company put it on the back burner. in june they gave her 30 days to respond or they would rescind the offer. 

in the middle of june she hired a lawyer not connected to her insurance, rather a personal injury atty. i got a letter from the law firm telling me that i was going to be sued if i did not compensate their client the $40,000 she thinks she's owed from the car accident.

i kicked the letter off to my insurance company; i first called then emailed it: my adjuster that i was working with had an audible ""siggggghhhhh..."" after i read him the letter. then a strained chuckle. ""we will take care of this.""

i heard back from them on wed the 5th - they sent all documentation of the accident, the audio recording of her verbally agreeing to the settlement amount, and her ""manifesto"" to her newly hired atty. they apparently also included a note that stated that they were giving her until the end of june to accept the money or they would rescind the offer if she did not get this taken care of soon. 

my adjuster called me this morning to tell me that the issue has been resolved. she has signed an agreement yesterday that she cannot sue if she takes the money. according to my adjuster, they re-offered her the $40,000 because of two things: primarily they wanted this to just go away and they did not want to be sued for more, second they apparently know of this personal injury atty, he requires a very high contingency percentage and this woman essentially played herself by hiring someone that was not necessary. he collected on her behalf and took his cut.

that's all i know, so yeah. issue resolved and my insurance has jumped up a small bit in cost due to the accident. ",2

"i've simulated and plotted the entire s&p since 1871: how you'd make out for every possible 40-year period if you buy and hold.

note that this data is from robert shiller's work. an up-to-date repository is kept at this link(https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/tree/master/data). up next, i'll probably find some bond data and see if i can simulate a three-fund portfolio or something. but for now, enjoy some visuals based around the stock market:

**image gallery:**

* main image(https://i.redd.it/nn43lzu4d16x.png)
* after 145 years (all data)(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/investing/master/returns.png)
* your chance of selling at a loss(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/investing/master/snippets/short-probability-2.png)
* animated(https://github.com/zonination/investing/blob/master/readme.md#other-visualizations)

the plots above were generated based on past returns in the s&p. so at year 1, we take every point on the s&p curve, look at every point on the s&p that's one year ahead, add in dividends and subtract inflation, and record all points as a relative gain or loss for year 1. then we do the same thing for year 2. then year 3. and so on, ad nauseum. the program took a couple hours to finish crunching all the numbers.

in short, for the plots above: **if you invest for x years, you have a distribution of y possible returns**, based on previous history.

some of the worst market downturns are also represented here, like the great depression(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_depression), the 1970s recession(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%e2%80%9374_stock_market_crash), black monday(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_monday_(1987\)), the dot-com bubble(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dot-com_bubble), the 2008 financial crisis(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%9308). but note how they completely recover to turn a profit after some more time in the market. here's the list of years you can invest, and still be down. take note that **some of these years cover the same eras**:

* **down after 10 years** (11.8% chance historically)**:** 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1929 1930 1936 1937 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1998 1999 2000 2001
* **down after 15 years** (4.73% chance historically)**:** 1905 1906 1907 1929 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969
* **down after 20 years** (0.0664% chance historically)**:** 1901
* **down after 25 years** (0% chance historically)**:** *none*

---

**disclaimer:**

note that this stock market simulation assumes a portfolio that is invested in 100% us stocks. while a lot of the results show that 100% stocks can generate an impressive return, **this is not an ideal portfolio.**

**a portfolio should be diversified(https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/three-fund_portfolio)** with a good mix of us stocks, international stocks, and bonds. this diversification helps to hedge against market swings, and will help the investor to optimize returns on their investment with lower risk than this visual demonstrates. this is especially true closer to retirement age.

in addition to this, this curve only looks at **one lump sum** of initial investing. a typical investor will not have the capital to employ a single lump sum as a basis for a long-term investment, and will instead rely on *dollar cost averaging*, where cash is deposited across multiple years (which helps to smooth out the curve as well).

"for flipping out on my boyfriend for eating my cake?. my birthday was this past monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. i'm originally from michigan but go to school in texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. they were like my favorite thing when i was little and i'm not sure if they're only available in michigan but i definitely can't get them in texas. 

my boyfriend and i each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. when i got back from work the next day i was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

i went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. he laughed and said something along the lines of ""i couldn't help it!"" i called him a selfish asshole and told him i couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

he seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. he started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but i was so upset with him i just left. i came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. he said he couldn't believe i was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

i realize it seems stupid and i might have overreacted, but i still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. i've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought i was being ridiculous and that i shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

am i the asshole?

update: i've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so i figured i'd post one here. i haven't been able to read every comment, but i've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. a lot of you seem to think i'm just really stingy with my cake, but what i articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that i moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

when he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. he apologized for eating all of the cake, and i apologized for losing my temper about it. when we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. i'm still not sure if this is the right move or not.

"public school teachers are overpaid, not underpaid.. very unpopular opinion that i have literally received death threats for. 

public school teachers in the united states earn a median income around $56,000 per year.  this is far too high.  

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/high-school-teachers.htm

https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary

https://www1.salary.com/public-school-teacher-salary.html

i'm not saying what they do is not noble, important, or difficult.  i am saying they are paid too much compared to other professions.

1.  public school teachers are paid through tax dollars under contracts negotiated by unions with the power to strike. this artificially inflates their wages and benefits.  (the purpose of a union). it's revealed in the numbers.  private school teachers, who do not have the power to force a tax payer to pay more, earn far less.  some estimates are as low as $37,000.

teachers union convention, nea top official - it's not for the kids, it's for the power.

https://youtu.be/bam8n24k8ke

2.  the median household income in the united states is only about $62,000.  that means that one teacher's income is nearly equal to the median income of entire households, most of which contain two or more incomes.  

but wait billy mays, there's more. 

3.  teachers are required by contract to perform their job only about 180 days per year.  private sector non-education wage jobs have 260 work days per year.  business owners work up to 365 days
- all net of holidays obviously for simplicity since christmas and new years etc. happen for everyone - 

annualized pay to equal out the effort put in by private sector and self employed workers then reflects an equivalent of $89,500 and $125,700. 

and please, don't tell me ""teachers work 16 hours per day 364 for little johnnie doing lesson plans and grading papers.""  stop it.  third grade long division has not changed for 2 centuries.  1 lesson plan per career can literally handle a lot of subjects - and i know teachers who do just that. 

teaching is not easy, but it's not hard either.  and yes, before you say ""try it once and stand in my shoes"" - i have.  

4.  on average, teachers are not very good at what they do and take little to no responsibility for results.  they are more facilitators than professionals. 

""these kids get out of high school and can't even read.""  

proficiency in reading, math, science and other subjects varies depending upon what is tested and at what point in the education process it's measured, and varies greatly from state to state and city to city, but reading proficiency is often as low at 40%.  math often under 50%.  half or more of our public school students are being pushed out into the world whether they are prepared or not.  private schools do considerably better in every category across the board. 

it's because federal funding - for those sweet salaries and benefits - is tied primarily to graduation rates, not proficiency.  and when proficiency tests are proposed, teachers scream like a banshee that it's unfair to test teachers based upon whether their students have learned.  

you can peruse this trove of data if you like.  it's fascinating actually.  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/index.asp?faq=ffoption3#faqffoption3

""it's the parents, not us.""  

you'll often hear this in response.  and it's true, parents are extremely important in little johnnie's life and success.  but that does not mean a teacher is without responsibility.  they are typically trained for at least 4 and up to 8 years post-secondary to figure out how to get little billy the bully ready even when he's a dick and won't pay attention.  the gifted and smart kids are going to learn the material no matter what the teacher does or doesn't do, all she needs to do is competently facilitate for them.  her job is to get slow witted corky some knowledge because he can't learn on his own. 

5.  schools are becoming prison camps.  for what we pay for, public schools are providing less and less benefit and more and more hazards.  i don't think it's because there were no donnie the drug dealer and billy the bully when we generation xers were growing up.  it's because school administrations have slowly changed the culture of schools to a more institutionalized authoritarian culture.  there is a growing attitude of contempt for students and parents.  cops are everywhere.  students have few if any rights.  the kids are treated with disrespect and 'zero-tolerance' policies that effect their lives and their personalities forever.  it gets worse each year. 

i do not see the same thing happening in private schools.  i believe it's because private schools have customers, and public schools have captives - and the cliche that ""teachers are overworked and underpaid"" has given them a generally bad overall attitude of smug superiority and entitlement.  they have become adversarial.  

https://youtu.be/so_gkquuisc

like i said, i've had my life threatened for this opinion locally.  it's dogmatically accepted that teachers are heroes that are overworked and underpaid. 

yet they work fewer days, earn more than almost half of entire households, have unions negotiating the best benefits in the country, the kids are not learning, the experience of being a student is increasingly miserable, and their own top representatives admit its not about the kids, it's about the power. 




edit - clarified median income being used because although my source link and second point said it, my wording was sloppy and confusing in my first point as was my source.  so i also added 2 additional sources which actually support a figure higher than $56k. ",6

"an update from jasoninhell. **tl;dr** - i am doing better and i continue to get better everyday

the first thing you may notice is this is being posted from a different account, i deleted the /u/jasoninhell account in a knee jerk reaction to seeing my reddit posts in the news.

i guess the first question to answer is how am i doing, and to that i would say i am doing well. i have bad days but i would think that is to be expected. it is just important that i, or anyone going through something, continue to use the support of friends and family as well as good coping skills to not let myself be completely defeated on those bad days. i won't lie, i struggled to get back to where i am. for some time i refused to sleep because of combination of fear of what i would wake up to and nightmares about that night. for a time i used alcohol to sleep but my family loved me enough to take it from me before it became a damaging and permanent habit. i was hospitalized because i did have thoughts of ending my life because i missed my children so much. from that i learned that you should never be ashamed of your mental health and not seeking treatment will only make it worse, not better. we have all heard it but if you or a loved one is struggling seek immediate assistance, your life is too important to throw away in a moment of weakness. by putting off treatment i only caused everything else in my life to suffer. i lost my job and became reclusive to the house. but don't worry i have been back to work since december and i have nearly regained my former position and salary, so i am good and require no assistance.

the second question would be how do i feel about the sentencing. that is something that is harder to answer, because no matter what the sentence nothing will bring back my beloved children. do i think she should have gotten the death penalty (which indiana has), no i do not. she wanted to die and after 9 years of giving her what she wanted when she wanted it i was not going to give her another thing. do i think the life sentence will have any appreciable effect on her? i don't know, one thing she always stressed for the entire time that i knew her was that she lived her life without any regrets. even after i caught her cheating on me she continued to say she had no regrets.

as for the ex-in-laws, they continue to be a problem to this day. shortly after everything happened they changed the locks on the home i was renting from them with my property still inside. after trying to civilly negotiate the return of the property it was required that i involve law enforcement. that is an ongoing legal battle. a member of the family accused me of stealing property i had purchased from them prior to the death of the children and threatened to take action against me unless i paid double what i had already paid them. i alerted the authorities and as far as i know that is resolved. they continue to make visiting my children's grave difficult, during the one year anniversary they sat in their truck and just watched me the whole time i was visiting the grave. because of that i don't visit the grave as often as i would like to.

if i can impart on you something i have learned through all of this it is that you should always take the time to be with the ones you love. it doesn't matter if they are asking you to read the poky little puppy for the millionth time or asking you to play smash bros even though you both know they will wipe the floor with you every time, just do it because you never know what time will be the last time. always make sure they know how much you love them, i had the fortune that the last thing my children ever heard me say was, ""i love you, good night. i will see you in the morning""",7
"for telling strangers that my wife and i are married?. my wife gets upset when i do this but i feel like i'm in the right here. if we are at a bar or a party, we usually go our own separate ways to socialize. i'll notice that she'll be talking to a guy that neither of us have met before and i can see on his face that he's into her. so i'll head over to where she's at and grab her, give her a kiss and compliment her. something like ""she's so funny. that's why i married her."" then i leave so she can continue talking. almost every time, the guy ends up leaving after i do. she's never really flirting with these guys, just talking sports or politics. but she's beautiful and very smart and she has a knack for being very personable so they assume she is flirting. she says all she is trying to do is have a conversation with a stranger but i'll i'm doing is letting people know we are married. if it was just a conversation, they should still be able to talk to her even though she's taken. aita?",3

"i auctioned off my virginity. i was 18 and really tired of being a virgin, i was super super embarrassed. i didn't really have any close guy friends and had no idea how to flirt or even communicate with a guy, i was in a really depressive state. i felt like i missed out on the fundamentals of highschool love, especially since i'd been looking forward to it. 

i also however needed some money for school, and really was just craving any sense of excitement in my life. i went to this random as website that's similar to craigslist and made a post about my virginity with pictures , and instructions on how my fantasy went. and then  set the bids at 1,500 and the bids reached 10,200, it was so weird the amount of guys who just have money like that. 

anyways the guy who had the highest bid was 50 and owned some sort of business im the trades not sure what. he wasn't ugly, he was actually decently attractive but then again i was into older guys so i'm biased. we set up a date and he took me to a nice hotel, bought me a dress, we went to dinner, and when we came back there was flowers, chocolates, and a present for me in the room. and rose petals on the bed and candles lit, all like i imagined since the 8th grade. 

we had sex it was okay i mean i had nothing to compare it too at the time it felt amazing. but the best part was after since he made me feel comfortable, and we just talked all night and cuddled and made out.i left the next morning and that was that. i finally could move on,with my life and not focus on my virginity. 4 years later and im actually a sex addict so it's weird how i was such a late bloomer, yet so into sex.

"i (20m) was introduced to this girl (20f) and she is incredibly intimidating.. i'm not sure what to do. this girl is a great and stable (first for me) and attractive and smart human being. i really like her and the friend who introduced us said the second i left her sight, she texted my friend about how hot i am which is a good sign. 

the thing is, i used to be able to draw back in like, 11th grade. she paints full canvases. i listen to music (but like really hard rock) sometimes i guess. she writes music, sings, and plays the piano. she's an accounting major when i'm in graphic design but only just started so all i can really show her is a super low effort picture i took so i could keep up with the class. 

this girl is incredibly intimidating to me. she knows all these ""show-off-able"" skills and tricks and they're really really cool and the best thing i can do is make fun of the shot-types used in taken 3 and play video games. i have no idea how i can compare much less impress this girl and keep her interested. 

note: we haven't even hung out 1 on 1 but there's obvious chemistry. not enough to obscure the worries behind this post but we can hold an engaging conversation (neither of us have really talked about ourselves yet so idk if that even counts.)

note 2, electric boogaloo: we've only hung out like, twice and it was always cut short. i know i'm overreacting. i just have no idea what to do about this.

note 3 return of the op: okay so i'm going to clarify some stuff to get rid of some negative comments. by impress i mean more of keeping up with her than romantic comedy ""impress"" garbage and by show off i don't mean to show off i mean they're like party tricks or stuff you can physically show off to people or have proof you can do like a painting. i've got none if that.

"i walked 2 miles with half ounce of weed up my butt cheeks.. back, many moons ago i was a a college party with a few of my mates. few drinks in, the house owner asks us if we want to smoke. me being new to the scene i thought he was talking about cigarette or cigar. we get up to his room and he pulled out a bong and we all started smoking.

so we finish a few rotations of the bong and i decided  this would be a good time to buy some weed for the first time. i smoked a little bit of what i bought and about 30 minutes later i hear a loud bang coming from downstairs.

apparently cops raided the house because you know, college party, small town, people get fairly annoyed when you have a loud music booming at 4 a.m. in the morning. so i panicked because i've never been this high in my entire life(im new to spicy cabbage ok can't blame me) and here i am with a half ounce of weed on me. i don't want to throw the weed away because i paid a decent amount of money for it so i did what any logical human being would do i spread my butt cheeks in a room of about 15 people and stuffed it between my butt cheeks. 

i make my way past the cops as they are escorting us all outside and out the door. then we get to the porch area and somebody says they're going to start chasing us like he's whispering it to me and i'm high and drunk all at the same time and i have this guy behind me aggressively whispering ""run. they gone chase us....."" thinking back to it now he was probably trying to get me to run so the copa would chase me instead of him. maybe he had something worse on him than i did.

i wait till i get about like a half a block away from the house and i just take off running.. the entire time i got my butt cheeks clinched hoping i don't drop his half ounce of weed out my crack. at some point i heard a dog barking and thought it was a police dog. i did the one thing you never so in scary movies.. looked back. i tripped, fell, rolled and popped up to kept running only to realize it was a neighbors dog. i make it about two miles or so to my friend's house. did a reach around only to realize somewhere between the party house and my friend's place the weed fell out. 

so now drunk, high and somewhat bloody me thinks, hey this is the perfect time to go back in the middle of the night with a flashlight looking for the weed i dropped that smells like ass crack and party juices.

i never found that weed :-(.

tldr: bought weed for the fist time at a college party that got busted by the cops. stuffed the sack of weed between my butt cheeks to conceal it as we're being escorted out. ran from cops thinking they were going to chase me only to lose my weed from my butt cheeks.

**edit1**: i also have another confession. i posted this to r/tifu this morning and made an edit becasue someone said the story was unfinished. it wasn't very eventful after that but here is what happened. 

i ended my night going back to my friends house after failing to find my weed and passing out on his livingroom floor. 

prior to passing out, i vaguely recall playing his flute for a girl that was at the party who also ended up at his house. i was trying to marinade(yes marinade so don't bone apple teeth me) her but failed horribly. i don't know how to play the flute. never have a day in my life before then. 

i also don't remember much more than that about the night. just that my friends gf had a cute yorkie(?) that i was obsessed with all night.

wikipedia is a much more credible source than almost all of the clickbait poorly constructed garbage sites.. i am so sick of seeing teachers not want to use wikipedia as a source. it has its flaws but still so can any other website. and they always say that you should take the sources from the wikipedia page itself but why? that's where the page got it from. yet some random website with billions of ads made from someone no one knows is better than a strictly moderated website with a large community who can amend false facts on a dime?,6
"for specifically ordering food my wife hates so i don't have to share?. yeah so i'm basically joey from friends before anyone states the obvious. i really really hate sharing food when i order out at restaurants or takeout. i always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. 

so my wife is a terrible food snatcher. she always says she's not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food i've ordered. so many times i've ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. i ask her to order her own stuff but she'll say she's not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. 

anyways in the past year i've found a good trick where i simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won't touch any of it. recently some family members discovered i do this and called me a massive asshole. they called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly i'm just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. aita?

**edit**: to those asking if i've told her to stop, i do, all the time, but it's honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly. or she'll sigh and push her own plate around and ask, sadly ""so how's your food? it looks really good..."" or she waits until i'm taking a break to ask me multiple times if i've finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she's begging for scraps. it just feels super disconcerting when someone is so focused on me eating my meal.

i like just getting something she has no interest in cause then i can eat in peace, and that usually forces her to order something else for herself as well.",3
"for essentially siding with my family instead of my wife over their precautions for our incoming newphew?. throwaway cause reasons.

backstory: my wife and i have two kids (9f, 4m). my wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an ""oops"" baby. she had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. no major complications or anything like that. 

on the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my sil, and utilize ivf in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. so when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then i would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. for example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. my wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my sil. she would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my sil and she would basically replace it with her own idea. so that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. the baby is due at the end of this month.

so last night my wife received a facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my sil that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. my wife lost it. she started saying how completely insane my sil and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. 

while i said that i agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, i can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. they can't afford to go through ivf again and my sil is too old it would be high risk anyway. my entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. we would just need to get our records. i also said i can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so i can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. but overall, i sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.

well she took this as me siding with them over her. she's been angry with me ever since. aita?

(also, please don't reply with ""you should always side with your wife! hurrr dee durrr"". i don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... don't bother.)

edit title: nephew :/

edit 2: while my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough i think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). we are pretty close. we all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. they watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. there's always been full trust between us. and i think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. i don't know if that changes anything? for those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?

edit 3: holy cow, this blew up since last i checked. first of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. to address some common questions/comments... 1) no, sil has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. and there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) no, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. i feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? it was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) it is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. she's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my sil had. it was more the fact that my sil rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) i probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... but i didn't really ""take a side"", at least i wouldn't consider it that. it's not like i said, ""well hun, they are right and you are wrong"". it was more the fact that i wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think i was taking their side (i think?). so take that for what it's worth. 5) i appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... i feel like that's what i tried to do here. maybe i didn't handle it to perfection and i agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). maybe i'll send an update if anyone is interested.

edit 4: just cause it's hilarious that i actually have to address this... but no, i was not implying that just because the baby is ivf or their ""one shot"" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. not quite sure how some folks deduced that. i was merely saying that due to those circumstances i could more easily empathize with my sil's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.",3
"my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue.. i honestly don't know what happened. a couple of days ago, my girlfriend who i lived with left our apartment while i was at work, claimed to her family and mutual friends that i'd been physically abusing her, and blocked me on everything. i have no idea what's going on. there weren't any major problems in our relationship that i could see, and we just had consensual sex last night. the very last time i spoke to her before all of this happened, she was perfectly fine, kissed me goodbye before i went to work, and everything was normal.

then i got a call from my dad toward the end of the day asking me calmly if i've been hitting my girlfriend. i didn't know what he was talking about, and then she told me.

i rushed home, and she had gotten all of her stuff and is staying either with her family, or a friend of hers. my facebook account is blowing up, and i have no idea what to do.

none of what is being said is true, and i don't know if someone is just playing a cruel joke on me. a few people even mentioned that the police were called, but i haven't heard anything as of yet.

the last major argument we had was probably in february around valentine's day. we were going through some financial trouble, the stress got to us, and we were both getting upset with each other over petty, household things. she was my best friend, the person i could rely on to be there for me, and the person i would be there for always, no matter what. we were definitely planning on getting married. it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. her family had basically accepted me into the family. i was close with both her mom and her dad. i only called them both once each -- neither of them answered my calls. i called my, i don't know, ex? just twice. no answer. she blocked me on every social media platform of hers that i know of. i asked a couple of friends, but they are being distant with me -- just one word answers, or ghosting me.

what the fuck is happening here? we'd always been up front and honest with each other, and our communication was stellar.

tl;dr: i guess my girlfriend decided she wasn't happy in the relationship or something, and instead of breaking up with me, she left behind my back completely out of the blue, and claimed to everyone that i've been physically abusing her. i have no idea what's going on.",7
"was my dad really grooming me or am i overreacting?. hey reddit. i need your help! my (21f) father (61m) has had a very strange relationship with me my whole life. i don't live with my family anymore due to university so this isn't affecting me currently, but i am having a hard time processing it. i had another dream about it last night and i cannot bare to keep questioning these horrible thoughts anymore. am i being stupid or is this serious?

there are little pieces of evidence that have amounted to me wondering if i had been treated wrongly by my dad. weirdly, a lot of things don't add up and i don't want to accuse my father of anything in case i'm being over dramatic. but there have been occasions where i have known that my dad did things to me that weren't necessarily normal but i didn't say anything. 

my dad doesn't really like my brother. at all. in fact he barely talks to him unless he's getting in trouble. he loved me though. he absolutely adored me. and i adored him too. i never felt uneasy or unsafe around him. even though he did some weird things to me. there was always something a little bit off. even when i was little, i just had this weird gut feeling about his relationship with me. he isn't my biological dad, my real dad ran away to new zealand when he found out my mum was pregnant with me. that's a whole other story, i have actually spoken to him since. he has three of his own kids now. 

my mum and ""dad"" met when my mum was trying to sell her house. i was only a baby at the time. one of the weird things about my relationship with my dad is that i have told lies to make him seem like he is my biological father. i don't know why i do that. it's not that i'm ashamed about him not being my real father. but i feel that maybe if i lied enough i would convince myself that he is my real dad, and real dads don't touch their real daughters in that way. 

i distinctly having a conversation with my mum about how mum and dad met. this was the first time my tummy ever churned in regards to my dad. she said at the time they met, she hadn't washed in a few days, was struggling with post natal depression and was a single mother. she says she didn't look good whatsoever. to the point where she was so shocked that my dad had asked her out on a date, she worried that it was because of me. my dad was a really good looking man. he was very successful with the ladies. i don't know whether my mum was so insecure that she couldn't believe he would ask her out, or if she has secretly had her own gut feelings. ""what do you mean, to do with me?"" i asked. i was about 13 or 14 at the time. ""well, i was worried that your dad might have been with me to get to you. paedophiles come in all shapes and sizes."" i think i'll remember her saying the word paedophile until the day i die. i felt so physically sick at her saying that but it is something i think about on a daily basis. 

that's when a lot of things came flooding through into my memories. i never used to wipe after going for a pee. when i was about 8 years old i was in the bath and mum was watching me. we were discussing about toilet habits and i told her i didn't wipe. ""why not?"" she said. ""it really hurts when i do"" my mum looked alarmed. ""what do you mean?"" i shrugged it off ""i don't know, it just hurts when i touch down there."" i think my mum was concerned but i don't think she ever found out a reason for it. but i do still remember it being tender when i tried to wipe. i can't remember when it all started. when mum was away on nightshift, he would make me sleep in the bed with him. i honestly can't say if anything happened. he would spoon me. but i don't know if anything else occurred. when my mum was on nightshift, she would get home after my dad went to work, and while she was sleeping, i would take my brother and i out. we would ""run away from home"". i was always such a well behaved girl. but my behaviour got so bad during that time that my mum broke down and told me she would put me in care because she couldn't deal with me. i remember being the problem child very vividly. it's one of the only parts of my childhood i remember. my mum had severe depression at that time too. she was actually put into counselling because i think she tried to take her life. nobody has spoken about it but i do remember her having to get taken to this place. which i later learned was a psychiatric hospital. i don't remember any of the time she was away but obviously it was my dad looking after us. 

fast forward a few years and i have began puberty. i was struggling with my body image like most girls were and i was very confused about everything. i was late getting my period, i was a late bloomer and was teased pretty badly at school by both girls and boys. i have vivid memories of my dad telling me that i have a lovely figure. he squeezed my boobs and my waist and my bum on multiple occasions. ""you're soft in all the places men love women to be soft in."" i was in my school uniform the majority of the time he did it. i looked him dead in the eyes as if to say ""what the fuck are you doing?"" but he always laughed. it really embarrassed me. and most of all i was uncomfortable when he did it. he was supposed to be the one keeping me safe and yet he was the one that made me feel the most humiliated. however, i never felt daunted if i had to spend time alone with him. i didn't feel unsafe apart from when he did touch me. but i have read that one symptom of trauma is not remembering much of your childhood, and i really struggle to remember many memories of both childhood and high school. this could be a coincidence however. 

there were multiple instances where he would slap me on the bum, make me sit on his knee (as a 14/15 year old) and touch my thighs or my bum or my boobs. he would love giving me massages, and would take off my bra. i specifically remember one time i asked my mum if she could rub my back because it was really sore. i took off my bra and hit the ground as quickly as i could to avoid either of my parents seeing my boobs. my dad remarked ""christ, you have a big set of tits now"". in front of me and my mum. it embarrassed me so much. in a moment of anger i snapped at him ""why the fuck were you even looking?"" why would your dad want to see your boobs?? my mum repeated what i said to him too, which surprised me. i assume she was taken aback by it. nothing more was ever said. 

throughout mostly my teenage hood my dad was very hands on with me. i noticed this when i realised that my friends dads weren't nearly as touchy with their daughters. i thought my dad was just showing me affection. as teenagers do, i became aware of masturbating and it became a massive hobby for me. on multiple occasions, my dad walked in on me. and didn't make any attempts to leave. there was a few times i near enough shat myself because i noticed him peering through the crack in the door. out of panic, i pulled up my pants and ran over to the door and opened it. it was him stood there. ""yes?"" was all i managed to blubber out. then he walked away like nothing had happened. i hadn't heard him coming up the creeky stairs on any of the occasions. 

for some strange reason, and i really don't know if this is paranoia or not, but i always felt overwhelmingly scared that come my 16th birthday he would try and take things further than just inappropriate touching. i have no idea why. again i don't know if i'm overreacting. i had a boyfriend at this point and dad then became very distant with me. i did however think it was strange that if i knocked on the bathroom door to tell him to let me know when he's out the bath so i can brush my teeth, he would tell me to come in anyway. and he would be there, naked, in the bath. not trying to hide anything. i don't know if that's normal or not in a household? throughout this time he did keep touching me inappropriately but again i didn't feel scared in his presence apart from when he did touch me on the odd occasion. 

i think the biggest situation that sticks out in my mind was when i had broken up with my boyfriend and was about to begin university. i asked my dad if he could crack my back as he was the heaviest in my family and always managed to. mum and my brother we're both in bed. he then asked, ""do you want me to give you a massage"" i shrugged and said alright. i took off my top and he did my back for a while. nothing weird happened. but then he took off my pyjama bottoms and my pants without even asking. he started rubbing my bum cheeks and my thighs as i laid there in shocked silence. he then proceeded to rub my vagina from behind and my bum hole. at one point he spread apart my bum cheeks to, i suppose ""inspect"" my ""area"". i was absolutely mortified. he did this for about 10 minutes or so. that was the only hard evidence i have for him properly inappropriately touching me. i thought this was going to be the time he raped me. i thought all those years of being scared about turning 16 were finally rational, as horrible as it sounds. i was now 17 but had been with my boyfriend since before i was 16. so my dad hadnt been as full on with the touching. i laid completely still. i didn't tell him to stop. i was so embarrassed. but at the same time i didn't want to embarrass him by telling him it was wrong. so i just let him and hoped nothing would progress. it was the most uncomfortable and ashamed i had ever felt in my life at that point. the only time he spoke to me was to say ""you're very hairy aren't you"" which added to the awkward and embarrassing situation. i never ever told anyone about it. 

i didn't tell a soul about my fathers actions towards me the whole time it happened. i continue and have since the age of about 12 had dreams about my father having sex with me. in all of the dreams, i enjoy it and want it. this confuses me even greater. i feel extremely lost and embarrassed and so utterly ashamed of myself. i'm scared that i'm overreacting with this. i don't want to accuse him of anything. i love my dad but it's no doubt that he is mentally ill. i am not angry at him, i actually feel very sorry for him. this is more for my peace of mind. i just don't want to be confused anymore. and i keep dreaming about it and it's terrifying me that it is a reality.  if anyone would be able to make sense of all this i would be eternally grateful. thank you so much for listening, it's taken great courage. 

edit: i cannot thank everyone enough for their kind words. it was extremely hard to write but whilst writing i was actually able to process a lot of it. i am in the process of replying to everyone who has sent me messages, i didn't expect this to blow up at all. when i began receiving the first couple of replies i did have a big cry. i was hoping to myself i was being extremely stupid and i had been overthinking about it all. first thing on monday, i am ringing a counsellor. that is for certain. i am extremely wary about telling my mum but i'm going to see how i get on with therapy. i know it's the right thing to do, but part of me is thinking that ignorance is bliss. i dont want to tear my family apart. these feelings may change if/when i begin to open up. i'm extremely lucky that i have a loving and understanding boyfriend who unfortunately has also suffered from child abuse. he has had therapy for his and is urging me to do the same (for my diagnosed depression- it's probably linked to all of this tbh). he's the first person i'm going to tell in person. i actually wanted to tell him but i thought a reddit opinion would either tell me to cop on or realise that it was as serious as my gut feeling told me. unfortunately it was the latter. if this has taught me anything, it's that yeah there are horrible cruel people, but you strangers have shown me kindness. i can't thank you all enough <3",7
"for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid?. my husband and i have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). they currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. my husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. 

so here's my current dilemma: i want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. it'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but i've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. however, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. his oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. i was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. 

between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. i'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ""ok sure."" and now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. i still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. i feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. however i get that he wants the best for his kid as well but i resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. 

i want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and i want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. for thinking this is a good plan?",3

"caught my (m34) wife (f30) cheating on me and she is furious with me. a week ago my wife said she was going out with univesity friends after some volunteer shifts that she does. she said she would be home late and not to worry, after 11pm she said she was going to stay at her friends house and go to work from there in the morning. this is very unusual so i started calling and messaging like crazy hoping that she could just take a taxi back. she refused to pick up the phone and told me not to worry. 

she continued to refuse and was obviously v drunk so i became worried and very suspicious. not proud of it but i went into her emails and checked the rota for her volunteer work and sure enough she wasn't on it. this led me to check her internet history and i found a whole heap of searches clearly indicating an affair.

i went to work that morning and she still wasn't back so i confronted her when i got home that evening. she admitted the searches and said they were just her fantasies and that she had been at an 80s night and nothing had happened. when i told her she hadn't stayed with at her friends she admitted that too but said she had been at the club all night and came straight home. obvious lies as she was looking at hotels online and from card payments from our joint account i can see was not in a place that does 80s nights.

so i'm not an idiot and it's 100% clear what has happened but she will not admit it and becomes really angry with me when i bring it up. she says constantly that she stayed out and made the searches because i have never paid her enough attention and she needed more intimacy from me. 

i'm losing my mind because i still want to fix this but can't even proceed to the first step of accepting the situation (let alone forgiving her) as she wont admit what is obvious. shes so angry with me and has recently told me she is scared of me now because i was so angry the evening after she was out all night. she doesn't look remotely sorry for how she has acted and now when i bring up the night she simply says i told you everything i'm not gonna talk about it. this,  even though her story is provably false.

i feel like i'm purgatory now. together for 10 years and i don't even know this person.

i need to know is this kind of behaviour typical for someone who has been having an affair? 

if so are there ways i can get her to admit what she has done, or at least be willing to answer my questions in a believable way?

is there a way i can move forward because everything i do is hitting a wall.",7

first of all, the taste of vanilla ice cream is much smoother and relaxed than chocolate. nowadays, everyone says ""chocolate's"" they're favorite candy or treat, but vanilla has a better taste.

if it's a hot summer day and i have the choice between chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream, i'm going to go with vanilla because it has a more refreshing taste than chocolate.

"i manage a 24/7 motel and only make $600 a month.. there really isn't a lot to explain on this one, i just have a feeling that i am being illegally exploited by my employers and i'm looking for some advice.

the facts:
- i work in hospitality in idaho
- i am either engaged in work-related activities or am on call for 24 hours out of the day, 7 days a week 
- i live on site where i work
- i am not allowed to leave for more than an hour (only during a specific time of day as well)
- i haven't received a day off since i started working here three months ago (i have been offered a fill-in to cover for a few hours, but work resumes as soon as i get back home, and i have to find a fill-in myself in a small town of 500 people.)
- i have not provided my employer with my social security number, but they're withdrawing taxes
- i never filled out a w-4, and never recieved an employment contract
- i was told i was salaried but on my paystub it's blank where hours should be and my wage reads $8.00/hr
- i do not have a set payday and my checks have always been 1-4 days late, yet always show a previous (on-time) date when i receive them that aligns with a normal bi-weekly schedule
- i know that my employer is currently undergoing an audit and have been red flagged in the past
- they have a security camera in the office adjoining my apartment with audio equipped that can clearly record my conversations in my living room, and the only separation is a non-locking sliding door that's really more of a privacy curtain than anything, and blocks out no noise
- i have no defined sleeping hours, and more often than not get woken up in the middle of the night to attend to my duties
- there are no labor laws posted anywhere in my work area or common areas. i haven't seen one since i started working here

i know this might be a lot of information, but i just want to make sure that i have a case before i waste my time or money seeing as i don't have much time to investigate or get out of the office.

"update ca parents took and sold my car and won't tell me who to. what's the best step to take from now.. thanks for the replies when i originally posted(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77vzo6/ca_parents_took_and_sold_my_car_and_wont_tell_me/).

all i needed was a more with-it police officer. i went in person with all the documentation proving that my car is my vehicle and with my brother, and stated clearly that my car had been stolen and sold and we knew who did it. the officer i dealt with this time treated everything seriously and listened to us both.

i had my car back within two days. my parents had taken it and hadn't sold it like they claimed but were renting it to someone they knew. the car was retrieved from the rentee's house. i hadn't yet made a claim on it so it was returned to me the day after retrieval. my mother has been charged, and i've also been questioned about my parents drug use. i'm over the moon that what they did trying to rip me off has shone a light on more of their behavior. 

i'm still trying to gain clarity with my insurer about possible internal damage to the engine or transmission and having that thoroughly checked out, but that's beside the point.

as a bonus this was the last straw for my brother. he'd been still living under our parents thumb and this gave him enough reason to also cut them off and commit to acting against them. i have my car back and my brother back more than i did before.

"by teaching my children not to fight, but to work together. almost two years ago now.

two kids, boys, 5 and 4. fight like cats and dogs. anything to annoy the other and start a fight. grab a random object and throw it at the other when dad isn't looking kind of thing.

one day i'm cleaning up the kitchen and the ruckus is extreme. i interject and sit them both down for a long talk about how much better things can be if they cooperate instead. at the end of it, i went back into the kitchen and resumed cleaning. a remarkable length of *quiet* while later, the 4yo comes to me.

4yo: dad, dad, come see what i made! \*grabbing my hand\*

me: sure, lets see.

he leads me to their room to the corner table where they have art supplies. and points to the papers on the table. he likes to draw and i encourage it when i can. what i see on the table however, are just random scribbles...

me: is this what you wanted to show me? \*i pick up the paper and check both sides, just a few random scribbles\*

me: that's... great buddy, but why don't you come get me when it's finished? \*i put the paper down and turn to walk\*

4yo: no, no! dad, *look!* \*pointing at the papers\*

okay, maybe i missed one? i look through them again, no, just scribbles? i'm still looking at them when suddenly..

4yo grabs the papers from my hand and tosses them back on the table.

4yo: ok dad, i'll show you later, you can go. \*pushing me towards the door\*

i'm a little confused, he's not like this usually. i pause outside their room, and when i do, i hear the crinkle of cellophane. 

my boys room is off the hallway leading to the stairs down the the basement. the stairs to the basement, are crinkling. 

i poke my head around the corner of the staircase and there is 5yo. with a package of oreos clutched to his chest. he looks at me with big eyes and i just hold out one hand and point with the other. i took the package and he walked by right as i couldn't hold my dad face any longer. 

see, the oreos were on top of the refrigerator. so what has happened is 4yo baited me, while 5yo got a chair from the dining room, carried it to the kitchen to retrieve the loot then put the chair back and hid. this has to have been meticulously plotted. i'm a mix of horrified and proud.

i had to quickly put dad face back on to tell them to not sneak treats and to now clean their room. then i left the room and had a brief ""what have i done?"" moment back in the living room.

"ma landlord wants to fine/evict me for having sex with my partner in my apartment. cites ""illegal activity"". does he technically have a case?. so, bit of a weird one, so please bear with me.

i rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. it's a nice enough apartment and up till now i've had very few issues.

the problem is he's rather... conservative, and i'm rather... gay.

once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. i told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time i ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. if i refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

he cites ma state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

i looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. i know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have i technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

i really don't want to move early (lease started in sept), or have an eviction on my record.

i know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

do i need to take this seriously, or can i start coming up with more ways to say pound sand? what should i do if he does try to take further action?",2

"by handing my usb to my roommate. **gonna use a throwaway. i'm not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** 

i had an essay to print out this weekend but since i no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down to the print shop. so, i wasted no time copying all my shit to a usb and grabbing my coat. i was literally just about to shut the door behind me when i heard my roommate calling my damn name. he wanted something printed out as well. a fucking flyer or some shit. random, but ok whatever. 

he asked if he could use my usb. i didn't see why not, so i said sure. once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my usb and said: ""valar morgulis, motherfucker"". i said: ""valar dohearis, you degenerate turd"" and bounced. the print shop was busy when i got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. little did i know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.

i handed the cute print shop girl my usb with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. as far as i knew, there was nothing else on the usb except those two documents. print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. her expression was unreadable. like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. she leaned in and sheepishly asked: ""which two files, sir?"". i replied: ""only the two you see on there"". 

at that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. folders that never even existed when i copied my essay. here's the damn punchline. all these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:

**""tiny twink drilled hard by handsome handyman""**

**""college stud drains his big uncut cock""** 

**""cute boy fucked in the ass by daddy""**

**""teasing my drunk straight friend with raw dick""**

**""high school hunks fuck bareback""** 

**""hung doctor gets head after physical""**

**""planet of the bottoms: dawn of da dick""** 

there were loads more, but i'm sure ya'll get the pornographic picture. i shook my head in horror and said: ""that ain't mine"". print shop girl's eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. 

""what should i print for you, sir?"" 

""it's my roommate... he does this kinda shit""

""of course""

"for getting a single mother fired even though she was nice to me?. for context, i am really into body building and have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week since i was 13 (now 29).

there is a personal trainer, ashley, at my current gym thats also a single mother of two. i mention this as it's the reason i think i'm probably an asshole since she clearly needs the job to support her kids.

anyway, i'm not really friends with her, but she's always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. we talk occasionally. yesterday she asked if i wanted to add her on social media and i figured why not, so i said yes.

later in my workout i started looking through her posts out of boredom when i saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. the picture was clearly taken at the gym.

this really angered me because they're trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it's not to their face. i scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. she discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they're working out.

"for becoming hysterical at a school secretary's expense?. throwaway- im just going to get in to it.

i (19m) got a call from my mother frantically telling me that she got a call from my sister's school because apparently she had ingested peanuts, she is deathly anaphylactic, i was at home for reading week, and am studying for upcoming midterms, but dropped everything and drove as legally fast as possible to get down to the school.

i ran in to the the office which was really crowded. there was only one secretary, and i knew instantly who it was- my mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

i ran in but there was a line up, i told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if i was blind ""there's a line hun"".

i waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

i got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""ready to talk to me"" i was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. i was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation i was in.

i dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. the secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

she started by telling me ""see hun, i told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, a student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, i could have handled this situation a lot better- i have a lot of students to deal with""

i looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

i yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""the school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

are you serious? how am i supposed to react in that situation? yes, i agree i was really angry, but i feel like i was justified- my sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- i would have waited if i heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. aita?

edit- 

to add context, some people are confused as to why i didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) i don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, i guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",3
"for not wanting my mom to cover my daughter's chest in pictures. my daughter is 17 months old. being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. when she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.

my mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which i don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. to me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when i addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. so i told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. aita?",3
"lost my baby at 35 weeks this morning. *eta some stuff at bottom of post*

so i'm sitting in this hospital bed just waiting for the labor to progress. the reason i'm writing here, even though it's unfortunate i have to think about this at this time, is because i'm currently in a different state (united states citizen) from where i live/am employed- so i'm pretty sure my insurance isn't going to cover jack for this whole ordeal. i'm worried about just how much this bill will be. i've already told the doctor that if it is safe to do so i would like to leave asap (after the baby is delivered of course) to prevent further charges. i'm still considering not getting an epidural to save that cost as well, although mentally i'd much rather not feel any more pain with this nightmare. 


i won't know just how much i'm facing for a while, but i'm sure its safe to assume we're looking at a lot, possibly 10k+? that's just a guess though. i wouldn't be shocked if it was well more, considering what us hospitals charge for everything. 


i also have never planned a funeral. ...we were thinking cremation, and i'm sure the funeral home can give us a quote when the time comes. no seperate ceremony or anything. i hope it isn't too steep. 


so, i guess i'm just wondering if anyone has any helpful advice with regards to saving a bit of money on these types of things and/or the best way to manage what will surely be quite the financial burden most effectively? me and my husband are both employed, and i will definitely try to pick up as many shifts as possible extra (rn). my husband is a bit more limited since he's a professor/musician and where we live isn't the most happenin' place for him to pick up some decent gigs for extra cash. we have a mortgage and 3 kids at home so obviously those things are still a factor. 


i'm just so lost... i guess i'm just hoping for some sort of guidance with this type of thing. anything. i never thought i'd be in this position...and everything feels so crazy. i guess this is the only thing i might find answers for in this whole mess, and i sure would appreciate any advice. thanks in advance for your time.

** so while i was in labor, it obviously became much more painful and i just could not keep up with my replies. i was reading though, and i want everyone to know that i did read every single reply and i went back to the post to catch any replies that do not show up in my inbox. i will respond here. i'm not sure i can reply to everyone individually, as so many of you reached out- and i can't express enough thanks for that. 
- many of you also have unfortunately had similar experiences and i'm so, so sorry for your loss. and thank you for allowing your experience to help another. 

**i did end up getting the epidural for thos who were concerned. i am still in the hospital, and the doctor will probably see me later this morning (i couldn't sleep much, it's 3:45am currently). 

**i put someone in charge of calling funeral homes, as so many of you had great suggestions with that and finding a place that could offer an at cost (and some places, free or close to it). unfortunately/apparently in this area only 2 places even accept stillborn babies, and 1 was about 2k before the urn and they told us you have to buy at least some certain  type of urn. many of you have said that is not true, but this person did not argue with them, she just gathered the info. the other isn't much better, but apparently i don't have much choice either. i will call them tomorrow as i can manage a more stern demeanor when inquiring about specific things/dealing with ruthless upselling. 

**a kind redditor (and another looked up some more generalized info) who works in insurance actually extended a helping hand and is offering me some more personalized (without personal info) guidance, which is so nice and will hopefully lend some answers while we get to figuring out the nitty gritty of it all. 

**i've had a few troll messages, and if you are one please know that i'm an adult who knows when and how to ignore- luckily it doesn't get to me but i do hope you reconsider your actions when messaging others as they may not be as stable/prepared for such a thing, especially when dealing with profound tragedy. 

*i'm quite tired atm, so i will update again later. thank you all for your help, suggestions, condolences, etc. much love to you all. ",10
"i'm transgender.... but i despise the general fakeness and selfishness of almost every transgender person i've ever met. i don't really want to go too far in detail, but suffice to say, the mocking of women, the grandstanding and tears over simple pronoun mishaps, the lack of basic understanding into gender theory, the hijacking of each others posts with their own (1-up-like) successes with their transition, the fake voice, the ridiculous garish wardrobes that don't match for shit, the victim mentality, all of it. i fucking hate all of it.

if you feel like a woman, why the fuck do you not feel like a woman insofar as much to want to ya know... actively reduce the stereotypes and archaic definitions about what being a woman _even fucking is_. because apparently for most of us, it is turning into a whining peacock with no hobbies or interests outside of being fucking trans. 

i have a great job, a great career, my co-workers respect me, because... idk... maybe i wasn't awkward as fuck in my interviews and so actively focused on the fact that i'm trans (like every other moment in their lives) that i couldn't even answer a technical question without whipping my estrogen dose into the equation.

i'm just fucking sick of it. you all are making us look bad so get off your fucking ass, quit whining, get a real fucking job, learn to match your wardrobe, stop dressing like you're 14, and gain some fucking weight so we don't all look like we have multiple disorders stacked on top of each other.

well i guess i went into detail. oh well, if you are trans and you see this. get your fucking shit together, no body cares about how hard life is. i'm half-black, trans, and kicked out at 17 but i don't use that as an excuse to survive off of the kindness of others and falter on my responsibilities -- not only as an adult -- but as a fucking _productive member of society--. and if you do want to focus solely on being trans. great.

read some fucking gender theory and philosophy and make it mean something. no one wants to hear you whining and complaining going in circles because you haven't read a book in so long (other than affirmation after affirmation) that your vocabulary has dropped to the level of a 3rd grader.

fuck.

"for introducing my gf as a model?. so i have been dating this girl for awhile now. she's beautiful. she works as a professional model. not like an instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

she also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. she usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. for some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. she only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

so the other day i was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. i said ""thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. later she said i was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and i had no right to correct her. that what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. that her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

i dont see what the big deal is so here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*edit just to clarify i she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. i just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after i did it. also i was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when i introduced her to my friends.

\*\*edit 2 theres so many comments and i am trying to read them all. i do respect her. i do love her for more then her beauty. shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. she's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. honestly i am blown away with how pretty she is and i've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. so that part does excite me.

i genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think i am the asshole for this i do value how much money a field brings in. when i chose my area in college i did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. i am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and i am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. i'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

i shot an apology text (we're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her dojo. she said we can talk after work and i offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200b;

\*\*final edit

at this point i imagine no one is reading anymore i asked the mods if i should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

i was really bothered by the things people said. not because i wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. i didn't want to be the guy everyone said i was. i really didn't.

&#x200b;

first i want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. yes i knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. we have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200b;

next i want to say she was meeting some of my good friends. i was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. i was trying to point out her accomplishments. i thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. i can see where i was wrong. i did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and i felt it was more glamorous. i am an asshole for that. i did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and i'm also the asshole for that too. i wont deny it. but i dont just see her as a trophy. i do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because i learned something really really important.

&#x200b;

after this thread blew up like it did and i had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick i was i knew i was dead wrong and had fucked up. i texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. i asked her if we could talk about it and i could try and make it up to her. she agreed. i told her i wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if i could sit in on some of her classes. she said she would like that. i made it top priority. i left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200b;

what i saw really opened my eyes to be honest. i watched two classes and took part in the second one. the first one was her with a kids after school class. she was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. thats dead wrong. it must be much harder to teach kids and i think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. i saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she does want to be a mom one day).

&#x200b;

the second class was a womens self defense class. i took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and i was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. i got manhandled by about 15 women. we had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. for those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200b;

i definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. she taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. most importantly i saw the qualities beyond her appearance that i love most about her really shine. i realized the things i love most about her; her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. this is really the part of her i love. it doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. i also saw how much she loved what she was doing. i saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. i'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong i was.

&#x200b;

i told her this when i went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. she also filled me on the modeling thing. she doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200b;

first off its not as glamours as i thought it was

&#x200b;

she said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200b;

she works as a model because of a few accidents. she was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. thats all it took for her to be a model. it took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. she started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. she feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. she said being called a ""model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by what she is and not who she is. she doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. she doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200b;

she doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. that she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. she doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. she feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. she wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200b;

this is where i lit up and felt i had something to really offer her. i work in finance. go ahead hate me but i do like money. i like to have it, i like to make it, i like the freedom it affords and i like to watch it flow and grow. so i offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. i thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what i know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. we both win. she agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and i will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200b;

finally i asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200b;

i know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. i learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. in the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why i love her. so honestly thank you yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but i needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. is she the better person? yes she is. do i deserve her. no i dont, but i am going to do better. i really do love this woman, i wont ever do this again.",3

"by putting a vibrator on my boss's desk. this didn't happen today, but years ago. i worked at an insurance agency.  it was a small office with a receptionist and a few insurance producers.  we were a tight knit group and would frequently joke around with no subjects being off limits. not your typical professional environment.

one of the producers, we'll call her lisa, had a boyfriend named dick.  lisa was a recent divorcee and her relationship with dick was very on again off again.  at the time this happened, they were fighting and not really speaking.

around the holidays we did an office grab bag thing.  i picked lisa's name out of the hat.  i decided that since she and dick weren't​ in a good spot and that she complained about how horny she was all the time, i'd get her a vibrator as her gift.  this thing was thick, about 8"", black, and had a gold tip.  

so we do the grab bag and everyone has a good laugh that lisa got a vibrator.  we're chasing each other around the office with it and having a grand old time.  as things die down, it got put on the boss's desk.

picture the things on a regular office desk...computer, stapler, some files, pens, phone etc... and a big black and gold vibrator.  a woman comes in to buy a homeowners policy and says: i have an appointment with boss.  boss had no idea the vibrator was on his desk until he and the woman went into his office and sat down.

the rest of us in the office immediately realize what was happening and we lost it.  there is 0% chance the woman didn't see it.  somehow, boss was able to stoically make it through the sale unscathed.  neither he or the customer acknowledged the giant gold tipped dong.  more so, this was the woman's first house and sales like that usually take a little longer as additional documents are needed for the closing and we would usually take extra time to explain the policy as insurance can be confusing to first time buyers.

the lady leaves and boss comes out red as a tomato.  he's not even pissed because he realizes how funny the situation is...and he still made the sale.  

i've always wondered if that woman ever tells the story about buying a homeowners policy with a vibrator on the desk. 

sounds like the story is over.... not quite.  lisa put the vibrator in her glove box.  a few days later her 8 year old son was rummaging around in her car, found it, turned it on and walked into her house rubbing it on his face saying: look mom, i'm shaving!

i think it might have gotten thrown in the garbage after that.

tl;dr: put vibrator on boss's desk, he didn't know and conducted business with customer. then a 8 year old boy thought it was an electric razor and rubbed it all over his face.

edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger(s)!
 matches the vibrator lol.",4

"2nd time in two months that the same las vegas hotel has served me (3 years sober and not id'd) booze when i ordered a soda. third update: i don't think anyone will see this anymore though. i posted my experience on my facebook and it's been shared quite a few times. cnn called me today. a few attorneys have reached out urging me to pursue a case. i really don't know what to do.

second update; i met with the manager today and he said he will do anything to make this up to us and keep it from being talked about outside of the hotel. whatever that means. i just thanked him and told him i'd call if i need anything. thank you everyone for al your replies. it's not the end of the world, just extremely dangerous and negligent on their part. i spent most of the night crying thinking what happens now, do i relapse, but luckily i woke up feeling normal and just as committed to my sobriety as i was before that gulp... his comments make me think he or the boys are afraid of something happening. i don't know what, but if there is something more i can do to ensure this doesn't happen to anyone again i want to do it, like contacting the departments you guys have provided in the comments. thank you again. 


------


the first time, i messaged their security and got an extremely apologetic phone call with an invite to come back for a few nights and a comped several hundred dollar dinner in one of their restaurants. more than kind, right? he said they could get in a lot of trouble for this, so they wanted to make it up to me.

it's night 2 of my stay here and i ask a waitress for a sprite with mint and lime, i was clear i didn't want a virgin mojito just in case that was too confusing for the bartender.. a few minutes pass.. she gives it to me, and like an idiot, i take a big gulp. yup. that's right. going on 4 years sober and i just swallowed my second gulp of booze, thanks to the same hotels inability to idk, make a soda?

what do i do? i had to unfortunately go through weeks of counseling after the last mistake. i just feel absolutely let down and disgusted with myself and whatever bartender made my sprite..


update; the head of the alcoholic beverage department called the manger on staff back, which is surprising because it's midnight. he said he'd appreciate if we don't go home, as he will come in the morning to speak to us because he feels this has escalated to a dangerous situation for both the hotel and me. i have no clue what that means but i'm assuming the video they found of them pouring booze into my cup, then the video of the waitress clearly telling me my drink was virgin has something to do with it, or the fact that this mistake is the exact reason they even invited me back..... who fucking knows. they just had me fill out a statement. i have the drink here in the room with me. idk why. i just need to sleep, i've been crying on and off for hours because yet again i'm left wondering if 3 years and change of sobriety is now down the drain.... and i need to to forget the taste of that strong ass drink going down my stupid ass throat.",2
"for telling a ""friend"" that at least ""my breasts aren't saggy like a pair of rotten melons"" over a joke she made?. i'm a ""small"" chested woman. not even that small, i like my boobs. there is this ""friend"" of mine who has like f cup breasts. 

for some reason, she likes picking on my breasts. she is always saying passive aggressive stuff like ""well, it's not like you'll ever feel real back pain, considering how small your tits are"", one time she picked up my bra when we were in the changing room after gym and said ""do you really fit in this? god your tits are tinier than i thought!""; ""can you really not pick up stuff with your underboob? that's insane how small they are!""; ""how will you nourish kids if you ever have them lmao""; ""if i were your boyfriend, i'd be soooo unsatisfied with them"". 

i'm not really confrontational, i just shrugged off her comments and told her more than once they're not funny. yesterday it was more, to my liking, a direct insult. i was just minding my own god damned business doing some work when she asked me:

her: hey op, would you use shoes if you had no legs?
me: well, depends if i had prosthetics or not. 
her: but would you if you had no prosthetics? 
me: i don't think so, why? 
her: then why do you wear a bra? hahaha they are so small. 

i was tired at the moment. i admit i snapped, i told her ""at least my breasts aren't saggy like a pair of rotten melons."" 

she got angry. like i just wished death upon her mother; father, and firstborn. she started crying and saying i'm an asshole for picking on such a sensitive subject for her ????? 

my boyfriend thinks i was not an asshole and technically i wasn't talking about her tits so that's shit she took upon herself. some of our mutual female friends told me i should apologize, her boyfriend told me that's a sensitive subject for her and i should apologize. she sent me a text that she will be mad at me until i properly apologize to her. 

i don't want to apologize as i think i was not the asshole here. play bitch games win bitch prizes, or as we'd say in my language, this woman ""se lleva y no se aguanta"". 

but why would i be here if it not were to ask beautiful reddit... aita?


**edit** we are *friends* because we work in the same place and she referred me to the gym we're working out together right now and the women i'm working out with. i do not share my personal stuff with her nor do i think we have a friendship per se. we are more acquaintances than friends. she does tell me some of her personal stuff but it's not reciprocated. 

**edit 2** also, the ""technically i wasn't talking about her tits"" part comes from my boyfriend, not me. i know i went to the jugular with that shit. 

**edit 3** thanks for the silver and gold, kind redditors! i didn't expect this to get that much attention but here we are. 

i replied to her message saying that i would apologize if she did too. she told me she had nothing to apologize as i *don't have big tits nor suffer like her* bitch what. she also started bitching about my boyfriend and how he is a bad influence for me ???? no one even mentioned him. i think this bitch has a sick crush on me or has her head way up her ass so she tries desperately to not be the one in the wrong. 

i took advise from here too and told her to stop making comments about my breasts or i'd have to go to hr. you know, culturally (in my country) it's not that of an offense for women to speak about other women's breasts. she told me i was a crybaby and a weakass softie. 

i'll post screenshots (with translation) when i'm in my computer so i can edit that shit. thanks everyone for the support. ",3
"aita? told gf to move out and life has gotten 10x harder for her.. hi

i'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.

in a nutshell my gf (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/m) house last year.  the house is owned and i bought it because i have two children (8 yo twins - m and f) from a previous relationship.

when she moved her and her girl in i made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.

yet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.

- left mountains of food everywhere.  - left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.
- got muck/handprints everywhere
- broke and refused to replace things in my house
- would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day
- refused to tidy up saying she was tired
- left mountains of clothes everywhere
- used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)
- constant drama, shouting, arguing - witnessed by neighbours
- literally drained me emotionally and financially
- both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.
- put holes for shelves etc in all my walls
- would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc
- kept leaving the toilet a mess
- treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc

when i questioned her on any of these matters she would say i was being controlling.

about a month ago, a serious argument erupted and i told her it's best she leave.  i said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  it was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.

we are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place i feel terrible.  she's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously i was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  also, she was only paying me £165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of £600 per month for her rent alone.

i feel dreadful for this, i feel like maybe i should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.

aita?  or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?


edit: just to follow up - she doesn't drive and i also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before i was acting like her own private taxi service.  ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.

update:  wow, didn't expect such a response from this!

after getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say i'm nta and the rest saying i am for staying with her i've decided to break this off.
like some of you've mentioned, i owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  a good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  as of this point, she is no longer in my life.

a while ago i asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:

 ""yes i think of you getting shouted at by xxxx""

some of you have said i'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  i would argue against this, but if i stay with her i would have to agree with you all.

update:  i wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, i'll respond.

a)  no the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if i was lucky.

b)  she never gave bjs

c)  she insisted on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  every time.  she told me ""go down on me, or there is no sex""

d)  never did anything else.  vanilla sex was as far as we ever went",3
"(fl) help! my girlfriend is threatening to tell the police i abuse her if i leave her and i am terrified for my future.. posting this here after originally posting on r/relationshipadvice.

my girlfriend is threatening to call the cops on me if i leave her and has told me in a very serious conversation that she will tell them i beat her and will take me to court and have me arrested. she has told me on the day that i leave her she will come to my house and wait outside, call the cops and tell them i just kicked her out after hitting her. i just started a new job and i have no criminal record and am absolutely terrified this girl will ruin my life. should i get a restraining order before any of this could happen? please please help me i am in serious fear for my future, career and life.

a few changes that happened last night from my original posting of this: almost every comment recommended i get a recording, so once she calmed down a bit i did tell her she needed to tell me on recording that i have never hit her and she did, only it was a close up to her face and not her entire body and she was laughing a bit thinking it was a joke just so i'd calm down. even though she admitted to the fact that i don't hit her, could a good lawyer argue that i forced her into this admittance since our environment can not be seen?",2

"when i was a kid (11 and younger), i vandalized my primary (elementary) school numerous times.. just for info, i'm female. i absolutely hated my school. i was diagnosed with adhd only a couple of years ago, at age 32. i daydreamed a lot, talked non stop, and my imagination was out of this world. that didn't work with institutions lol. i hated both schools, but primary school..ughhh. my attendance was poor, i'd fake being sick a lot. 

the school was located in my neighborhood. we used to play on the fields and courts during closed hours. we were allowed to do that, just couldn't go around the back of the school. i had friends, but there were these times i'd like to hang out with myself. that's usualy when i did bad shit. that's how you don't get caught! i wouldn't purposely hang solo to do bad stuff though.

three incidents stick out in my mind:

this one wasn't solo, but my act was. we wanted to play football/soccer in the dome, a little building in the back of the school property. i have no clue why? just to see if we could? we got screwdrivers and took the doors apart. so while everyone was playing in the dome and running behind it, i had a better idea. i grabbed some rocks, and wanted to see if i could deflect them off the dome into the school's windows. i could. smashed about 3 or 4 windows. each sound of the glass breaking was sooo satisfying. 

one day i decided to go to the football pitch with my golf driver club. we were poor kids, we'd find random things, so it's not like i had a set. just one driver. i wanted to see how far i could hit the golf ball. the school was kinda far away and i wasn't aiming for it. i swung and hit the ball. then i hear a smash in the distance. any normal kid would've stopped and ran. me? i wanted to see if i could recreate what i did. 2 more times.

this was probably the most idgaf moment. i was walking around with my football/soccer ball. i decided to go over to the school. i went into ther back area around the trees. genius me decides to kick the ball into the air for fun... around trees. the ball gets stuck. i attempted to climb the tree, but was unsuccessful. so, i see some big ass rocks. figured i could knock it out if the tree. i stand looking at the school, with the tree in between us. i start throwing rocks, and they're flying over the ball and into the windows. i smashed 7. this one was extremely satisfying, because the following day at school we had assembly. my headmaster was furious, asking if anyone knew about. i was gleeming on the inside.


young me had so much anger inside because of my home life. so i took it out on the place i hated. my emotions were internalized, i was quiet. so the anger festered. adults didn't know i was bad, because i wasn't disrespectful, and i never got caught. what i did was messed up, don't get me wrong. just giving some context.",11

"i would strongly recommend the military for re-setting your life financially and professionally.. basically what the title says.

once upon a time, i had a ba in a social science field that was getting me nothing but low-paid jobs, and i would have needed to go to grad school to ever have a real chance of landing a salaried position. i paid my own way through college and was not willing to take on additional debt for a graduate degree in an already very competitive (and low-paying) field. i wanted to go in a different direction.

i had worked part-time at a law firm during college, and i decided working in a support position (i.e. paralegal/legal assistant) was something i was very interested in. i applied for positions at every law firm in my general area and received nothing but rejection and one invitation to intern for free. no thanks, i had bills to pay.

the military had always been something i'd considered and i did a lot of research on the different branches and what they offered. turns out the army offers an enlisted position that was exactly what i was looking for--paralegal specialist, and since i had a degree i would enter the military as an e-4. the army also guarantees that the specific job you select is written into your contract.

it's now a little over four years since i raised my right hand-- i now work for the department of justice. my military service counts towards my federal retirement and also put me in a higher leave bracket. the high-ranking connections i made in the army jag corps combined with the job experience i received are what landed me this position. i have thousands of dollars in the bank that i saved because i didn't need to pay for housing, food, or health insurance while i served. i'll be able to use a va-backed loan to buy a house when i choose to, and if i want to go back to school i can do so for free using the gi bill.

i write all this because i read this sub regularly and there are so many posts by people who don't make a living wage, or majored in something unmarketable (like me) and don't know what the next step should be, or who have student loan debt, or are just kind of lost in life. and i think military service could benefit a lot of those people.

of course this comes with a large caveat: the military comes with risks. you could deploy, you could be in combat, you could die, you could be involved in a freak training accident, etc. you could also get stuck in a terrible unit with toxic leadership. it's all luck of the draw really. i was incredibly fortunate in having a positive experience but i know many aren't so fortunate. it's the ultimate 'your experience may vary' scenario. 

but at least for me it was a great way to kickstart my career in the direction i wanted to go and set myself up financially. i just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone who may be considering the service.",10

"the best time to look for a job is when you have a job - solid evidence from the federal reserve. there is an old piece of conventional wisdom, that the best time to look for a job is when you already have a job.  a recent study by the federal reserve bank of new york provides solid evidence that that is the case:

**do the employed get better job offers?(http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2018/04/do-the-employed-get-better-job-offers.html)** (federal reserve bank of new york)

> . . . we want to compare how job offers received by the nonemployed compare to those received by the employed . . . the most striking result is that there are very large wage differences associated with these offers: on average, employed job seekers receive hourly wage offers that are 39 log points (48 percent) higher than those received by the nonemployed. even after controlling for the observable characteristics of the job seeker and the employer offering the job, the employed receive wage offers that are still 22 log points (23 percent) higher, on average. 

that's a big difference - a very big difference.  there follows some discussion on why exactly the difference is so big.  (my own experience suggests that people who are already employed only look for jobs that are strict upgrades from their current position, so are more selective in what they apply for in the first place.)

that obviously is not good news for those who are unemployed.  but it suggests a few general ideas to guide the job search.

**don't quit a job until you have an offer for another in hand.** (as stated in the pf wiki(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/leaving_job#wiki_before_resigning_or_if_you_are_at_risk_of_being_let_go.2flaid_off).)  it's not just that being unemployed is *really* expensive - although it is - it's also that your prospects for finding another job are worse than if you stuck with the last one.

**consider starting early in looking for the next job if it looks like layoffs or an unlivable work situation are headed your way.**  waiting until you get the pink slip is a really bad idea.  even if the layoffs never materialize, you'll have expanded your business network by meeting with other potential employers.

**consider taking interim or temporary work while engaged in a long-term job search.**  ""what are you doing right now"" is a terrible question if the answer is ""nothing"".  being full-time looking for new work looks good on paper, but see the statistics cited above - it's bad for job offers.  taking a temporary position, even something like an unpaid internship (you don't have to tell them how much you're currently making - or not making), can improve your position in negotiating a new position.",10

"how do i help my underage cousin get an abortion in mississippi? update: it's done. thanks /r/legaladvice. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ze596/how_do_i_help_my_underage_cousin_get_an_abortion/

i'd like to thank you for your excellent advice which allowed us to help our cousin.

a few days after my post we asked her parents to allow her to come with me and my brother to dc as a cousin bonding trip. they were open to it and even ended up paying for her ticket and driving all of us to the airport.

we took mandatory pictures at all the usual places to make it seem genuine and then went onto the abortion clinic which we had previously booked an appointment. everything went smoothly and the abortion was performed. the next day our cousin wasn't feeling well but we had a day for her to rest before coming back so it was fine. we paid for the abortion ourselves although her parents giving us money to spend for this trip helped cover most of the cost anyway as we didn't really do anything else so we didn't need much money.

thanks again. now that it's over and the abortion is behind her and she's recovered i've had a chat with her about birth control and we're making sure this doesn't happen again (unless she herself wants to get pregnant, of course!). she has also dumped her boyfriend who completely ghosted her ever since hearing she's pregnant.",2

i did this today and her landlord sent me an email, three days after she died saying that he'll keep the deposit(which i guess is fair) because of the cleaning/painting/fixing the bullet hole, but that he also wants to be reimbursed because the house value will go down after the suicide and that he and the other tenant(my moms roomate) want financial support for emotional damages

he ended the email giving me two weeks to call and negotiate, if not then he'll take to court

i'm gonna be honest, i don't know if i can get into a legal battle right now, i'm barely functioning but the idea of calling and negotiating how much my moms death devaluated the house made me throw up. what should i do?",2

"update 2: just found out my husband (28m) invited another woman over to spend the night while i'm (24f) away on business. how to proceed?. thank you to everyone who has commented on my last two posts. i haven't been able to respond to everyone, and i'm still working through all the comments, but the advice, stories, and love you've shared has been overwhelming and absolutely needed. thank you. even the people calling me names and calling me out for not being stronger - thank you.

it hurt to come to the realization that we can't move forward from this. he's betrayed my trust so many times that i'd need him to verify pretty much anything for awhile, and that's no way for either of us to live. 

the fact of the matter is that we're both pretty broken, and have no business being in a relationship with each other, or anyone else right now. i truly don't believe he's a terrible person, but he has been a terrible partner. like many of you said, he can be a good person and not be good for me. 

last night, i chickened out. i was so scared of losing him forever that i said we should just take a break, have him fly home, and work on ourselves for a bit. there were a lot of tears, but when the conversation was over, i didn't feel better, just... stuck. 

this morning, i realized what i'd done. i did this the last time i tried to get out of an abusive relationship, and put up safeguards so i could feel comfortable leaving. my husband doesn't deserve to be led on, and i don't deserve to be unable to move on. i read through more of your messages, and i can't thank you all enough for your words of comfort, encouragement, and strength. 

the thing is, for you it's black and white. for me, my thoughts are so thoroughly clouded by emotions and history, and i have to let that all go. the best thing i can do for both of us is to give up. 

so this morning, i did. i told him that while we could take a break and try again, it would never work. i can never truly trust him again, and he wants me to change things about myself that are things i love and have no desire to change. we've been trying so hard for so long to make things work that we're just too far gone. 

there were lots of tears, but he took it well. he's agreed to a no-contest divorce, and we'll spend the next few days packing up our house before the lease is up at the end of the month. some of you may come at me with pitch forks for not screwing him over, or breaking up last night, or leaving him to deal with the house alone, but that's okay. i'll be staying at my friend's house until my new apartment is ready, and really focusing on just working on myself. i won't help him pack unless i have someone with me. much of the stuff is mine anyway, and i'd rather not leave it behind. you guys are right that my self-confidence has taken a nose dive lately. i have a lot of healing to do before i'm ready to consider love again, and i have two appointments scheduled with my therapist this week. this man is not a monster in my book, he's a little boy that needs to grow up. we both made our fair share of mistakes in this relationship, but rather than feeling sorry for myself, i'm choosing to take those lessons and move on. i'm the kind of person who is very good at bouncing back, it's just the getting out that's hard. thank you all for your help in that. i wish him all the best, and simply have no desire to harbor hate in my heart. 

**because i know how easy it is for manipulated, abused women to go right back, i've talked a lot with my family and close friends over the last 48 hours. i previously didn't share a lot of what was happening with them because i was embarrassed. everyone always said we were  the perfect couple, and i was so ashamed of all the problems we had. i've informed these people that they are not to let me go back, should it come to that, in no uncertain terms. i don't think i'll get to that point, but i just want to be sure.

edit: as a side note, i shared it for me, because damn i needed the loving slap in the face that this sub so gracefully provides. but i also shared it because i hope that anyone else who reads my story and sees parallels in their own life will have the strength and courage to put themselves first. if you're feeling like you need to get out, but don't feel strong enough, or like it's bad enough, or like you'll make it to the other side, feel free to message me. we're in this together. ❤️",7

"i was a substitute teacher and called an 8th grader a 'social media slut' and it still haunts me today. a few years ago i used to work as a substitute teacher. i was in my early twenties when this happened and have felt guilty and ashamed ever since. i can't justify my actions and i accept it was an absolutely idiotic thing for me to do. and in no way is this post an attempt to justify my actions.

i think about this atleast a few times a week and feel so ashamed of myself everytime it pops into my head. the memory is normally triggered by songs, associations or thinking of my future. and i guess i still to this day, fear very much it will haunt me in my future adult life.

i had been working as a substitute teacher for a few months before this happened. i was met everyday with atleast some form of insults from kids from all different ages. it wasn't anything new for the substitutes to be insulted, mocked or tested by these kids. i shrug off whatever they tried to insult me with (being single and alone, being ugly, you name it). but of course this wasn't every single student, class etc. everyone were so very different from each other and of course it also depended on their maturity

i heard stories of students refusing to do stuff for a teacher because she was of polish descent or students mocking a teacher constantly for being overweight. and because of this i think i always mentally prepared myself for the worst and i had build up this mindset to snap back if it was really needed (scolding them, sending them off, etc.)

one day i was having class with some 8th graders. i won't lie, i liked their class. they were mature, nice and knew how to treat each other respectively for the most. i don't know if i ever let my guard down at this point. but there was this girl, she was a good student and was also so very polite. she was on her phone just browsing instagram non-stop. i told her to put the phone down, but she kept at it. i shrugged it off because i knew me keeping telling her to put it away would be a waste of time and energy. at some point i'm sitting at a table with only 2 guys and said girl in the classroom, alone. the others had scattered to do their assignment somewhere else.

we start talking about social media and who is really is the most active of all the classmates. the boys quickly point out the girl and start talking about how she is always posting stuff, normal everyday stuff, fashion and sometimes content that would lean a bit more to the mature side. before i really give what i'm about to say a thought, i blur out ""are you a bit of a social media slut? as in do you post every single moment you can of your life online?"" the guys laugh and i guess at this point i had never idea what i really just called her.

a few days later a teacher approaches me and asks me if i called one of her students a slut. at this point i realize what i've done. i tell the teacher i of course didn't mean to offend or hurt the girl. i ran out from the teachers lounge as it was still recess and i found the girl. i tell i feel very bad for what i called her and that it was incredibly wrong of me to say such a thing. and try my hardest that i was in no way trying to hurt her. she smiles and nods and tells me it's okay, but i'm still just shaking inside my body. i tell her to have a good next class. the recess ends and i move on to my next class. the entire car ride home i feel so ashamed of myself as a person and how i could say such a thing to a person at her age.

and that's my confession. i'm not trying yo justify any of this. it's simply some guilt i don't think i can ever shake off myself and i hope other people will do better than what i did that day. i was of course fired and sent my employer a final message telling them how i understod why they termitnated me and that i'm deeply sorry for the inconvenience i caused.

i'm sorry for my english as i'm from europe. i hope you could make some sense from it.

"by getting frisky with my girlfriend. alt because this embarrassing for her and for me, and she follows my actual reddit account. 

anyways, my girlfriend and i have been dating for a while now, but we moved to opposite sides of the us to attend college. we would have been together for college too but stanford gave me that fat l. this wasn't too big of a deal freshman year since we still had summer and winter break to see each other, but starting last year things got really busy for us. i went with my parents when they flew back to china for a family emergency, and then over the summer, we both had work to do in completely different places. the only time we got to be with each other was over spring break. 

fast forward to our current school year and we again missed the opportunity to hang out over winter break, so by the time i fly out to the bay area to go visit her over spring break, it had literally been an entire year since i've even held hands with her. naturally, being stressed college kiddos with pent-up sexual desire, we sought release as soon as possible. so the morning after i arrived, we have sex. she has always been one to like rough sex, and in particular, she loves getting choked. so of course i oblige her and unwittingly, i leave a bunch of very obvious, very red and angry looking marks on her neck and on her arms from pinning her down. well we just casually cleaned up afterwards and went down to the kitchen in her dorm to make breakfast without really thinking about the marks.

i sat down at a table, and she went into the kitchen to grab a bagel or something, when like six of her housemates also came down to get breakfast. i guess i have a kind of angry disposition immediately after i have sex, since one of her friends asks if i'm doing fine, before heading into the kitchen as well. it's at this point that they also see my girlfriend, who is not with an angry-looking me, and who has red hand marks on both her body and her neck. well they put two and two together and soon, i see them whisk my girlfriend away, while one person comes to angrily ask me about why i was physically assaulting my girlfriend, while threatening to call the police and campus pubsafe. i naturally, have no clue what they're talking about and i can hear my girlfriend being questioned at the same time. the person who was talking to me begins to shout some stuff at me, and it doesn't take long before a few sleepy people start drifting out of their rooms and towards us to investigate. at this point, i'm guessing my girlfriend's friends offered to her to get pubsafe involved as well, because she dashes over to where i was sitting and begins to frantically explain to the small crowd gathered in the kitchen area what exactly had happened. she basically told a good portion of her housemates that she has a thing for rough sex, and that she had merely asked me to choke her while doing to do, much to the embarrassment of everyone listening, and to the two of us. extolling the details of your sex life to the public generally isn't one's proudest moment. afterwards, we both got a few very red-faces apologies, and she quietly ate her bagel.

tl;dr: choked girlfriend too hard during sex, nearly got reported to the police as a domestic abuser and then had to sit and listen as girlfriend told her dorm what our sex is like.",4
"for subjecting my boyfriend to my nakedess?. i (32f) live with my boyfriend (35m) of 5 years. we live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. as a result, our dresser is in the living room.

after work, i like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. while i'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. well today, i started telling him about an annoying co-worker while i was topless. out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". i was really taken aback by this. embarrassed, i went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

angrily, i came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. before i get into his reasoning, i will admit that i am naked quite a bit. for instance, after i shower i like to do a naked kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. he even mentioned that this issue came up in seinfeld and that jerry would side with him. i don't know about this, i feel like i have a right to be naked, but i don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

anyway, should i let my fur flag fly or aita??

update: before i dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! thank you! ok, so after this incident i decided to cool off and go to the gym. when i got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. i coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. while i'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! he gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! i watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. he then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when i'm naked. i understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. tough, but fair.

thank you again for your helpful comments! they were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how i was making him uncomfortable. in terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. i accept this.

i'm also a bit obsessed with all the seinfeld comments. jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. now kramer on the other hand...

and thank you to everyone who supports my kermit dance! i will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. but for no longer than 5 minutes. i know the rules.",3
"i 31m found text messages from my gf 26f of 3 years to another man including ""i love you"". should i kick her out?. so this happened a week or two before christmas. we work opposite schedules so one of us can be at home with our kid at all times. she works weekends (and the occasional week night) at a local children's hospital and i work 9-5 weekdays. 

i had recently grown suspicious of her ""friendship"" with this guy she would bring over for play dates because he also has a young daughter. they were texting a lot and making plans to hang out together more and more frequently. 

one monday night when she had to work i decided to snoop. i logged into her imessages on the kids ipad and immediately saw that they were regularly texting. she was not texting me at the time but she was texting him, and very flirtatiously. kissy faces. heart emojis. all that. stuff she used to do with me! i kept my cool and kept watching to see how far this actually went. at first i was in shock and couldn't believe that was actually happening.

by the end of the night i saw it. they exchanged ""i love yous"" and they spoke of each other as their ""missing puzzle piece"" while making future plans to hang out together, alone. i still have all the text screenshots saved.

the next morning i brought it up to her and in my anger told her to move out. she claims that she didn't mean it and she was going to ""break it off"" with him after christmas but i find that hard to believe. she also claims they didn't sleep together but they had hung out together multiple times before without me so who knows. she even bought tickets for them to go to a hockey game together! plus i don't know what she's doing at home when i'm at work all week. 

part of me wants to believe her and let it go because we have a kid together and it was supposedly just ""meaningless words"" but shouldn't she have thought about before she decided to have an emotional affair with another man? she hid it from me so she obviously knew what she was doing was wrong.

the house and bills are in my name because we are not married so she has no legal right to stay here as far as i know (i have consulted with a lawyer already).

am i blowing this all out of proportion or is forcing her to move out the right thing to do despite how hard it may be?",7
"nsfw i have a daughter. when i was fifteen i had a friend that i was kinda close to and i had a crush on her for so long. she was a lesbian though so that was out of the question. one day she started talking about how much she wanted a kid (she was 19 at the time) and of course being close to her she talked to me about it a lot.  

now i was still a virgin and very much attracted to her so i start hinting that i could impregnate her. we very slowly came about this conclusion together and agreed it would be a good way to go about it. she wanted someone she trusted to do it and i was almost like a brother to her.  

my best friend at the time let us use his house to do the deed and it was really awkward. she played music on her phone so any noises we made wouldn't be heard. at first we tried standing up with me behind her but she was too short so we wound up with missionary. she was just as awkward and nervous as i was so she didn't want to take her pants off all the way but i quickly realized this would be impossible in this position so i quickly took them off of her and went at it. it got really heated and it seemed like she was into it which really surprised me and turned me on more which fixed the nervousness and i finished after a few minutes. after that point it was somehow much less awkward and we left, chatting a bit throughout the day.  

a few days went by and she told me she wanted to do it a few more times to be sure it worked. she didn't exactly have to twist my arm to agree but my friend's parents were home at weird hours that week and we couldn't use his house again. there were some pretty expansive woods near our high school that we would skip class in all the time so we found a secluded spot in there. the next few times we wound up having sex were blissful.  

after a while she found out she was pregnant. she had told me beforehand that she didn't want me to be an actual father figure for the child and her family was gonna take care of everything for her. it's been six years and that still holds true, she doesn't want me to be in her life (not in a malicious way) and is taking care of the child herself. she wound up blocking me on social media because my friend wound up telling people about it and she thought it was me but we cleared that up and there's nothing negative between us. although i think i wound up blocking her at one point after because i got a facebook message request years ago from a different profile saying it was her and she just wanted to talk about the situation. i haven't talked to her for about five years now.  

you'd think this would be a great situation, right? i got to have sex with a girl i was crushing hard on and even though it resulted in her having a kid, i don't have to put any time or finances into it. most guys would kill for the opportunity i'd imagine. but i have a lot of problems that i want to discuss a little bit. first of all, there's this strange, deep twinge in me that jerks when i think about the fact that *i have a daughter* and *i'm a father*. i've procreated and technically fulfilled my biological purpose in life. i don't necessarily want to be in her life or want to meet her, but it's weird thinking about all that and it fucks with my head sometimes.  

my current so is an absolutely amazing woman that i love dearly and i know i'm going to marry. she's my best friend and my soulmate. we've both vehemently agreed that we aren't having kids; we aren't financially stable and even if we get to that point, neither of us could deal with that kind of stress. she doesn't know. i haven't told her and i don't know if i ever will. i feel like despite our deep connection and love and understanding for each other, she would look at me in a way that would make me feel as if i'm some sort of monster. i don't want to disappoint her like that. i just can't. i don't want to let this past decision affect something so pure and wonderful in my life. it's like i'm dealing with a heavy guilt that's never going to go away.",11
"my (30m) wife (29f) just told me she doesn't love me anymore and wants to end our relationship, but still live together for financial reasons and for continuity for our 3 young kids. is this a terrible idea?. i'm going to start by apologizing in advance if this doesnt stay fully focused.

my wife and i have been together for 10 years. married for 5. we met in college and has been the love of my life since.

2 days ago she told me she doesnt love me anymore and for her happiness wants our relationship to end.

i probably should have seen this coming, our relationship has been rocky since we met but for whatever reason i always wanted to make it work. 

we have 3 kids together, all under the age of 6. they are amazing and so happy and the best thing from our marriage.

financially, my wife is a stay at home mom. she owns our house outright from family money. she has no student loans but also no college degree. i make a fairly decent income and support our family. 

since my wife doesnt have a job and no way to pay bills, she wants me to move into her finished basement and continue to pay utilities and food for us and our kids, in addition to keeping her on my health insurance. she wants to take time to get her degree and file for dissolution afterwards, so she can support herself and our kids.

she also wants this for continuity for our kids. while she doesnt love me anymore, she doesnt want me out of our kids lives even weekly, and still wants to be friends with me.

i'm honestly dying inside right now, because as rocky as our relationship has been i've never loved her less, and she has been all i've ever loved or wanted.

i dont know how to proceed or even feel at this point. im terrified because i've let my friendships go since we've been married and while my family will support me i dont have many friends left. i'm terrified about finances. i'm terrified of not being able to be happy without her. honestly i'm so confused about everything going on in my head.

on top of that, is it stupid to stay in the house for our kids? it would be convenient for me financially too as even though if i moved out we would share custody, i dont have to pay child support this way. it's also better for my taxes. 

i'm just so lost i dont know what to think. sorry for the long winded ramble.",7

"by meeting a girl on tinder to, ""netflix and chill"". yes, this actually happened today, see imgur link. also, sorry for this being long, see tl;dr below.

i matched with a girl on tinder today. the profile was ambiguous, just a picture of her laying down on her belly, no bio. i usually start with a creative message derived from the pictures or bio. i decided to just message her, ""i don't have much to go off from your profile. what does come to mind is that you have a nice looking butt"" she responds, ""wanna touch my butt in perosn""(https://imgur.com/a/x6cas3v) you can read the rest of the conversation from that imgur link. bottom line is, we decided to meet at my apartment and that i would give her $40 for some weed.

this felt like a whole new level of trashy for me. so far in life, i have only had sex with four people, and i make a serious attempt to date them. i asked my friends what i should do, they said it did not seem too sketch. i was going to say no, until i thought to myself, *""hey dude, when you are an old man, you will regret not having casual sex with a stranger more than not knowing what could have been.""*

i end up giving her my number and she calls me. there were a few things over the phone that gave me a bad feeling. first, she sounded *way* too casual over the phone. it felt like i was scheduling an appointment with a receptionist. second, she thought that we were doing this at her place. i asked her if she had roommates, and she responded yes. i told her that it made more sense to do this at my place since i live alone. she ends up hanging up. i am thinking, *""alright, whatever this all seemed too good to be true anyways.""* she calls back 3 minutes later saying that she lost cell phone reception for a minute. this was the final item to make me feel uneasy. in hindsight she was obviously lying. the amount of time between calls was far too long for her to have just lost connection.

she agreed to do this at my place. i insisted that we get coffee first so i can make sure i am not bringing a wacko into my apartment. she agreed to that and i am feeling more comfortable now. she just asks for a ride, which was not a problem for me.

i leave to pick her up and get $40 for the bud. up to this point, i was feeling really nervous about going through with this. then, while i am actually going through with it, all those thoughts disappeared. i am just thinking to myself, *""tonight is going to be fun! i am about to get a little high with a cute girl, play some mario kart with her, 'watch netflix', get my dick wet, and maybe even... cuddle?""*

little did i know, i am about to get majorly bamboozled. the address she gave me was not listed. i call her, she says just to meet her at the rite aid on the corner. this is when i should have known to back out. however, at this point, i am dead set on eating pussy. i meet her at the rite aid parking lot. she actually looks like her profile and all the nerves are gone again. she said we could expect her dealer to show up any minute. she gets the call 2 minutes later. i am thinking to myself, *""what kind of drug dealer is this prompt?""* but me being a gullible idiot, i give her my $40 anyways.

then she meets some dude on the corner and they walk off together, not to be seen again. i immediately realize that i have been played. she texts me, ""ur beat sorry"" and that was that.

was i mad? no, not at all. the situation could have been far worse. it could have been more money. she could have been an undercover cop. she could have been lying about her age. i could have been beat up by her boyfriend. i could have gotten an std. the list goes on folks.

right now, i feel three things. i feel great shame, this is not the guy i am. i am just lonely and would have appreciated some sexual comfort. i also feel really bad for her. she must be in a tight spot to have gone through with that. i am sure that she needs my $40 more than i do. finally, i feel really unlucky, as yesterday was my cake day. if this could have happened just one day earlier, my post would have been gilded *for sure*.

ladies and gentlemen, what did we learn today? if a situation seems too good to be true, it is.

tl;dr i met a girl on tinder who just wanted to get high and fuck. i give her the money for the weed and she just walks off with it.

"i (30m) and my wife(31f) decided to take custody of my half sister(10f) after my stepfather died in an accident. i suspect that she was abused.. this is actually so heartbreaking to write. i really never knew my stepfather that much, because my mother married him after i moved out. my mother died fighting breast cancer and the custody of my half-sister was given to my stepdad. she was only 4 when my mom passed away.

i used too see her once in a while. she was always a quiet child. she didn't speak much to me. i always remember thinking something was wrong with my stepfather. he just didn't seem like a nornal person.

so, he died in an accident and i was asked if i was willing to adopt her. i and my wife have a 5yo daughter and we were trying to have another child when this happened and we felt that we could give her a better life. we were actually so happy. my daughter was very excited because she got an elder sister. she was very auiet and reserved but we thought that it was natural. 

but yesterday she came to me and she told me that she ate some chocolate from the fridge without asking us. i told her it was fine, and that this was her home and she could have whatever she wanted to.

but she suddenly started crying and told me that she deserved to be punished because she stole something. i was really taken aback by what i heard. my wife was alarmed and talked to her one on one and i was really shocked. 

my stepdad was an asshole and a predator. i don't want to get into explicit details but he used to hit her, and sexually harass her. i actually cried for so long because i couldn't imagine this innocent girl going through that. how do i help her?",7

"i stole my first stepmom's wedding ring. bit of backstory, my first stepmom was a lunatic. she treated her son (my stepbrother) like he was her husband, rather than my father. she would take him, my sister, and i to the store, buy him a super cool, expensive toy, then berate my sister and i for asking for something too (and it would usually be nothing even close to being as expensive or big as what he got). she would let him bully me, including knocking out my four front teeth (which i had to go without for almost a year cause the teeth weren't ready to come out) and every time i tried to fight back he would immediately cry and run to her and i would get in trouble from her and my father, who only went along with her shenanigans cause he wanted someone to take care of him (aka a wife). 

the final straw was when my half brother was born. i was only 7, but i was expected to raise him. i had to feed him at ungodly times in the night while my dad and step mom slept, i had to change his diapers, bathe him, all of the things you had to do for a baby and all the while i was expected to still do well in school and choir (which i ended up having to quit because of all this). 

one day, they left me home alone (another thing they did frequently) and i decided enough was enough. my stepmom had taken her wedding ring off for who knows why and i saw my opportunity to mess with her. i went into their bathroom and just snatched it up, along with a couple other pretty rings i saw. i hid it in a hole in the couch that only i knew about and waited. 

well she gets home and has a fit cause she can't find her ring and of course accused me, but for once my dad stood up for me and said i would never. i left the ring there for a couple days until she gave up and had to believe she had just lost it. i then moved it to a toy box in my room where i forgot about it for many years. me stealing the ring was the first in several things that caused their marriage to fall apart (not that they needed any help, they constantly fought from day 1 of their relationship). i found it again when i was moving out of my dad's house at 18, and by then my crazy stepmom divorced my dad and he remarried to another lunatic lady (hence why i moved out before i even graduated high school). i still have the ring, as it's very pretty and it constantly reminds me how i basically ended my dad and first stepmom's marriage. i still think it's hilarious to this day.

"took a shit outside of girls house i was banging, and her landlord stepped in it.. so i was about 19 years old, and i had just got out of my first long term relationship with my ex girlfriend of 2 years, and it was a hard break up, so i just wanted to screw everything in sight, well to make a long story short, i ended hooking up with my high school crush who was a few years older than me (21) she was a total babe, could buy me beer, but fucking crazy. well we started hooking up pretty regularly, and i started staying at her ""house"" for like a week (drinking, banging) i lived with my parents at the time and it was super cool to do. well i remember it was a sunday, because the cowboys were playing, well we had been drinking keystone light all day, and i ordered some dominos that night, so basically a recipe for disaster for any normal human stomach. so naturally i had to take a nasty shit like an hour later, and i was so sick, sweating, clinching my toes, everything to hide it. well her ""house"" wasn't much of one, just had one room with a bed, and a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom, and the bathroom was literally right next to the bed where we were sitting, so she definitely would've heard it, and smelt it, so i didn't want to do that because i didn't want to embarrass myself, or be gross. so i got to the point where i was so sick to my stomach i was about to shit myself, i told her i had to run to my car and smoke a cigarette, so i went outside pondering what i should do, and it dawned on me that i had paper towels in the glove box, so i grabbed them and went to the side of her house and did my business by the side of her house, and it was dark out so i wasn't worried about anyone seeing me. well i came back in feeling like a million bucks, we banged some more and i stayed the night again. well the next morning about 7am we hear loud banging on the door, and she went to the door to check it out, and i heard some angry talking for about 5 mins, and she came back all confused looking and i asked ""what's wrong"" and she said ""my fucking land lord is all pissed because he stepped in dog shit, and is blaming me for having a dog"", and obviously i don't have one! i almost shit myself again from laughing because i know he stepped in my poop, and neither of them knew it was me. funniest thing i've ever done, and i'm so excited to let people know finally.

"if the universe is an hypertorus, is it possible that we receive the light from a star twice ?. i recently read an article in a french science magazine stating that the universe might be an hypertorus (euclidian, finite and borderless). they represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

i made a drawing to make my question clearer : drawing(http://imgur.com/a/c84eq)

 *the three panels on the left represent the universe in 2d and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. the star is any star and the black dot represents the earth. the arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *the three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the earth.*

 * the first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * on the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. what we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * on the third line i was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. we would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**to recap**

it sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

"update: i won my case against former employer, without a lawyer. it's been almost 3 years. i want to thank the community for the direction/advice.. update: in may 2015 i resigned from a 13 year job, due to harassment caused  by a new employee, cousin of the business owner. former employer realized he didn't have a non-compete and in hoping to keep me away, filed a frivolous lawsuit, fueled by his cousin's lies about me. i initially hired a lawyer, and after the first month's legal costs of over $6k, i realized i could not afford a lawyer and defended pro se. i made mistakes, but in the end i survived the almost 3 years since this shitstorm started, and finally got the case dismissed.
i feel like a huge weight has been lifted. i'm bruised and broke, but you should see the other guy (i know he spent over $150k in legal fees alone). 


edit: case was in federal court, louisiana.


edit 2: since the update threads are locked by default, i'm going to add here my advice for others in similar situations, since it appears to be a common question in the pms i'm getting.


first: look really hard into getting a lawyer, even if only for initial settlement negotiations. a lawyer may get your case dismissed in the incipient phase. the initial month i used a lawyer gave me the general direction i followed after. it helped me discover some of the tools i needed to use later. unfortunately, my former employer got stubborn and it became a pissing contest. 

things i've learned and i recommend: read (download) the rules of civil procedure, and the local court rules. do not let deadlines pass! better file something incorrectly than not file, when an answer or action is expected of you. you will have the chance to fix errors later. have a witness(es) willing to write a declaration stating that your version is correct. use affidavits/declarations to get your evidence admitted. also - read the rules of evidence!

submit subpoenas, and take depositions! this is what ultimately helped me!

good luck, all! ",2

i swing around and the woman is standing ther. i ask her what the fuck she thinks she's doing, she said that she's just trying to hold him. i told no and fuck off. at this point she kicks me very hard in the leg, so i slapped her as hard as i could and she fell to the ground.

luckily there were witness who called the police and stuck around when they arrived. the woman was arrested for battery. the police said that i shouldn't worry since i acted in defense of myself and my son, they also made a note that she attempted to take him out of his carrier.

her argument was ""it's only $3000 more for a new car.""

"i played a very long lasting prank on my roommate in grad school, forgot about it, was reminded of it 1.5 years later, and still haven't told him it was me.. i just now remembered this after graduating from grad school 2 years ago because i was looking through my old flash drive and found the mp3 file i used to do the prank.

so our first year in graduate school, when we first moved in to our apartment, my roommate bought a new gaming computer. he left for a week to visit his family, so i snuck in his room and set an alarm on his computer to play every first friday of the month at 8pm. the mp3 i chose for the alarm was the spongebob squarepants theme song 800% slower (https://youtu.be/4oyo4bcy1sc). i saved the alarm and went about my business. i told my good friend about it after i did it, and then completely forgot about it.

well, as you can tell from the link, the spongebob squarepants theme song sounds scary as shit if you slow it down by 800%. it sounds all eery in the beginning, then the pirate comes in with the super low raspy voice and sounds like a ghost. then the children chime in with ""ayyy ayyy captain!!!"" but slowed down by 800% it sounds like they are wailing in hell.

after a year of living in the apartment together, we rented a house together with my other friend that knew about the prank when i first did it. after about 6 months of living together in that house, we were all in the living room playing dark souls on our computers, and it happened. the alarm came on. i completely lost my shit. my friend almost died, he couldn't breathe. we cried laughing for 15 straight minutes until we hurt and almost threw up. i had totally forgotten about the prank, then here it is, 1.5 years later, totally unexpected and that god damn alarm comes on when we are all together. it was glorious. we had never laughed so hard in our life. my poor roommate just immediately alt tabbed out of the game and closed the alarm like he was a pro at doing this shit, which i guess he would be after doing it for 1.5 years, and then he said ""yeah, my computer does that sometimes, it's like it's haunted or something."" at that point i couldn't tell him it was me. i mean it had been playing on his computer every first friday at 8pm for 1.5 years, how much of an asshole would i look like if i told him ""oh yeah, it was me. i did that then totally forgot about it."" i even discussed it with my friend the next day asking if i should confess. i never did, and he eventually found the mp3 file in the alarm folder on his computer and deleted it, which fixed the problem. here i am, almost 4 years later and i still never told him it was me. so tim buddy, sorry about that.",11

i'm on holiday with family and on a cruise, we all decided it would be a great idea to go tanning after a long walk around the city we're docked in. we went to the tanning area on the top deck and i split from my family as there wasn't many beds free and i saw a bed open next to this really attractive girl who looks early 20s (same as me) and i think i could have a good shot here so i occupy that bed and make a few bits of chit chat until the tiredness from the walk kicks in and i completely deck out and fall asleep right there. i must've moved around a lot while asleep because i woke up 15 minutes later by a family member telling me to cover myself up as one of my balls was hanging out of my shorts. 

first thing i did was cover up then look to the side to see the girl is no longer there but probably saw just like everyone else who walked past in the 15 minutes. i'm on this ship another week and the embarrassment will live with me forever. help.

tl;dr: fucked up my chances with a girl by my own nutsack that fell out while i was sleeping

edit: saw the girl in the breakfast room and after a while of thinking of what to say i went up and talked to her it went along the lines of ""so i don't know if you was there but i showed off a little more than intended yesterday"" she said she left before that happened to go for dinner but would've found it hilarious so i guess that's a massive win! i said i'll catch up with her later and she sounded happy with that so i guess it wasn't a complete embarrassment! sorry to the many people who did walk past me though hope you enjoyed the view.",4
"once you are a parent, you are always a parent. you aren't a parent for ~20 years and then you can move on with your life. you are always a parent.. americans seem to have this weird idea that once your kid is around 18, you can just leave them and live your life devoid of any responsibility towards them, but thats not how families (should) work. its how corporations *want* families to work.

think about it: in many (most) other countries, you have kids, they grow up, have kids on their own, and you have grandkids. you all live in the same house or in close proximity, and you all care for each other. your kids have to work alot and camt take care of their own kids in the evening for a few weeks? you take care of your own grandkids in that time. they are your blood.

money is not a problem, because your kids are thankful enough to give you what you need without you having to ask, especially if you are a pensioner. the kids are happy because they get to hang out at grandpas place with their cousins, instead of being in some evening kindergarten with bored caretakers getting paid minimum wage.

someone in your family breaks his leg or gets otherwise sick? you *help them out*. not forever, and not necessarily financially, but until they are good enough to go work for themselves again.

redditors like to treat family as some sort of inconvenience that you should strive to break apart from in order to become independent, but that is not true. your family is your origins. it is the people you should be able to trust, you should always try to help. and you should always be able to depend on. they are the one people on the planet you should always feel at home with. it's natural.

i think the idea that parents shoukd leave their kids to fend for themselves is pushed by corporations, and by now is part of american culture thanks to them. 

think about it - instead of taking care for their kids a little longer, parents use the money to buy themselves a new car, or a pool, or expensive holidays. $.

instead of loaning money from their parents, the kids have to take loans from a bank. $.

then, once the parents grow up have a family instead, they know that the grandparents won't take care of the kids themselves and they have to take them to a kindergarten $ and eventually to after school care $.

after the grandparents grow old and senile, you can be sure that their kids wont want to take care of them. and so they get sent to a nursing home. $.

and as a little bonus: during all that time, all people involved will feel kind of empty, and kind of sad. not full blown depression by any means, but there will always be a hole that cannot be filled. because biologically, homo sapiens *needs* to have a family. its how we evolved and lived for millennia. and how do we attempt to fill that hole?

"i wish we had never adopted this kid.. my wife and i had been trying for a couple of years to have our own kids, but found out we could not.  so, we went the way we had talked about many times before, and went through adoption.  because, hey, every kid needs a home, right?

that's when we came across our now adopted son, nate (names changed, of course).  nate was the bastard son of a whore of a mom who fucked who she could for drugs, money, etc.  his bio father had some sense and convinced mom to put all three of her kids (nate was the only one of his, the other two -- a brother and sister -- were from unknown / different fathers).  she agreed.  and that was when nate was about 6.  he was technically removed due to deplorable living conditions and abuse, but she didn't fight to keep him.

we met him for the first time last year.  i was sketchy on him.  he appeared to have adhd.  not a deal breaker, but wouldn't have been my first choice.  he never looked at us, jumped up and ran around the restaurant we met at, and had a hard time focusing.  hell, he's a 9 year old kid.  kids have a hard time sitting still, and get nervous.  ((i figured)).

my wife fell in love with him (i was still sketchy, but we *had* met other kids, so he wasn't our first choice at the time).  we started getting more info on him, planned on meeting him more, etc.  it was a learning curve.

we took him to chuck e cheese, just to hang with him for a day.  he was all over the place.  eh, kids.  no biggie.

we started finding out more from the foster parents (who we didn't care for -- they seemed to be brainwashing their kids, and seemed to be in it for the money).  nothing major, but i was still being cautious.  we figured maybe he had either adhd or some high functioning autism.  again, not a deal breaker, but it was something i'm not used to.  my wife had experience (volunteer and career) with special needs children.  he seemed to be growing on us.  called us mom and dad once, we started having fun together, it seemed to be a good fit.

we noticed (closer to the day we took him home for 6 months before finalizing the adoption) he had ""addictions"".  mostly videogames.  not too unusual, again, he's a kid.  kids are supposed to love videogames.  fuck, we both like them.  why not?  but he became aggressive.  like, wouldn't listen to you and if you turn them off or threaten to take them away, he'd become violent to throwing the controller, kicking a chair, etc.  we nipped that in the ass as soon as possible, limiting him and explaining why.  (we eventually took it away altogether -- may be explained later.)

he saw a therapist / psychologist / optometrist / general physician / and several other professionals.  one diagnosed him with adhd.  another thought autism.  another thought reactive attachment disorder.  all seemed... less than great.  but we're attached.  we'd get through this.

that was about a year ago now.  

ever since then, at least every other day (if not every day), we have had to put him in restraints (all okay per dhs, his therapist, and others).  we've had to get onto him.  we've tried different reward systems.  we've tried starting nice / second chances.  we've tried everything we can think of.  fuck, even trying to show unconditional love (when we feel nearly defeated).

he's constantly lying about everything and anything, he plays dumb, he threatens to be ""bad"" (which we aren't afraid of -- we've shown him many times we're not afraid of him), he breaks things, he has no emotions, anything.  never shows remorse (unless he's told to; ""tell them you're sorry!"").  does what he wants, even when he knows it's going to get things taken away.  he's tried (and somewhat succeeded) to hurt his dog, several times, because he ""wants to see how it feels pain"".  he's been pure hell.  he ""understands"", but doesn't care (from what we can tell).

just tonight, we had a date night, and dropped him off to a ""parent's night out"" group at the local y.  we had a great time, just being able to be ourselves.

we get back, i go in to pick him up.  the assistants there pull me aside and tell me he was caught trying to (well, not so much trying -- he did) grab several girls' privates.  twice.  that was all the info i needed.  i grabbed him, a bit embarrassed, brought him to the car and had him explain to my wife what happened.  of course, we've been talking to him for several hours now, explaining why that was bad, etc.  but, again, he shows no remorse and just makes up excuse after excuse.  long story short, he wanted to, and so he did.

after everything we've been through...  i honestly regret adopting him.

i don't know if i'd adopt again if given the chance.  even if given the chance to go back in time and change my mind on him and switch to another kid, i don't think i would.  ~~i'd~~  we'd be much happier without him, or any other child in our home.

i wish nate had never come into our lives.  and i'm pretty much sure my wife wishes the same thing.

**tl;dr** this motherfucker we adopted has got to be fucking crazy.  no other explanation.  ",11
"my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry her and i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything?. not sure if this belongs in this sub because it isn't my relationship i'm asking for advice about. if not, apologies. 

tldr: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend of 6 years to marry him, and i'm the only one who knows the truth about how unfaithful she's been to him. he's completely blinded by love and to him she can do no wrong. i know it might not be my place to say anything but i don't want him to make a huge mistake.

so my good friend ""aaron"" and his girlfriend ""mary"" have been together for almost 7 years. they meet in college and are in a very close relationship. personally i would call them extremely codependent. neither of them really have any friends aside from each other. she doesn't let him have guy friends. in fact she doesn't let him do a lot of things. he's not allowed to go out past 11, not allowed to drink or smoke, she has to approve of all of his friends, and he's not allowed to be alone with other girls. she's got this guy on a tight leash. 

the reason why they're still together is that aaron is completely whipped, and to him she can do no wrong. he talks regularly about how amazed he still is that she finds him attractive. (he's a decent looking guy, but she's like super model level good looking) 
they post cutesy couple photos every day (im pretty sure she makes him post them) and to everyone who sees them they appear to be the perfect magical fairytale couple.

anyway a few weeks ago he told my boyfriend and i that he was planning on proposing to mary. of course we congratulated him because he seemed super excited. 

now here's the issue: a few weeks prior to this, i hung out with a friend of mary- ""alison"". alison told me about a party they went to where mary got drunk and slept with her ex. after the party they began hooking up regularly, and she had a threesome with him and a friend of his. aaron has no knowledge of these hookups. 

i told my boyfriend about it because he shares my friendship with both of them, and he believes that we need to say something but i'm not so sure how to even go about that. it will destroy him, ruin their entire relationship and maybe a friendship as well. however i think in the long term he will be unhappy with a marriage where she's so controlling. not even that, but if she's completely okay with cheating on her long term partner it will be the same once they're married. 

is telling him the right thing to do?

edit: to clarify, the cheating has not been going on for 6 years (as far as i'm aware) and the hookups occurred recently.

edit 2: some of the commenters are calling me a bad friend for not telling him immediately. after giving it some thought and reading the comments, i have decided to tell him as soon as i can, most likely tonight if he's free to hang out. to those saying i'm being a bad friend for waiting: this is a huge deal, and it will greatly affect the future of aaron, and i want to make sure i break the news in the correct way. this man is blinded by love. he's not going to be expecting this news at all and his whole life is about to change. i'm definitely not going to do nothing, because he deserves much better than this woman, and he deserves to know the truth about what he's getting into if he still decides to marry her. i'm expecting a full blown shit storm, i'm expecting him to be hurt, angry, in disbelief. i don't believe it's wrong that i'm asking for a bit of advice on how to approach this. should i have told him sooner? maybe, but what difference would a few weeks make? for all those asking, i'll post an update when i do it.

edit 3: i've talked to aaron since i posted this and he is coming over tonight to talk/hang out. my bf and i are going to tell him together because he knows the situation as well. a few of you have suggested i talk to mary first to give her a chance to come clean. while that's a good idea, i'm not as close to her as i am to aaron, and i don't see that going over well. i would much rather tell him and leave it to him to decide what to do from there

edit 4: new information has been received from the third party friend alison. she has sent me screenshots of texts that do prove mary has been involved with her ex. they send messages regularly and he has sent her nudes.

edit 5: lmao i'll just mention that aaron just got to our house (8:00pm est) will update later if i can. thank you all so much for the kind messages and helping me work this hot mess out. ive been stressing about this all day but i believe i am doing the right thing in telling him.

edit 6: quick little edit. (11:00 est) we all talked for a good bit, i told him what i heard from alison and it went better than expected, but he was still pretty mad and upset. we are all just chilling and drinking now- i'll post the whole story tomorrow. thanks again for all the replies!",7

"for embarrassing a friend on his date because he didn't pay back the money he owed me?. so i lent a friend of mine £500. he needed it to see him through til the end of the month and promised to repay me on payday. 
not a problem, i trusted the guy and knew he was good for it. 

payday comes and goes, no sign of the money. i sent him a message about it. he said ""oh yeah, sorry i forgot, i'll do that now"" 

two weeks pass and still nothing. i message him again. he said he'd send me the money. still nothing. he was then avoiding me so i wasn't able to see him face to face. 

i messaged him again and he didn't reply.

7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. i've not been able to get hold of him, nor have i seen him. 

this weekend just gone, i was out at a restaurant and i happened to see him as i was being seated at my table. he was on what looked like a date. 

now at this point i could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. it's worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. so i decided i'd go and say hello. 

i pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how i am etc. 

i then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. he looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so i tried something from one of the other plates. at this point his date (i'd learnt that this was their second date) said to me, ""excuse me, but this is our food. what do you think you're doing?"" 

i looked at her and said ""well since i'm pretty much funding this meal, i figured i may as well sample what my money is getting."" 

i then said to my friend, ""it was nice to see you, i'll leave you to it. we can catch up another day.""

i then left to go back to my table. the people i were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. some were in favour of what i'd done, others not so much.

"if i broke up with my girlfriend over my cat's mental health?. throwaway because she knows my reddit account. hear me out on this one. please? 

&#x200b;

i've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. i've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting molly. molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. about six months later in december she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. she fell in love immediately and so did i. i tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. she said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. 

&#x200b;

i still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. for one, molly refuses to listen to him. he growls, he hisses at her. she started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. she doesn't listen to me when i try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. she keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. i work at home, and he's a completely different cat when i'm home and she isn't.  he plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. 

&#x200b;

i've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. every single time i bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. they're not, but she's not a good fit for him. so at this point i'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  our relationship isn't that solid but i think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too.

"accidentally played porn at my girlfriends sisters wedding.... hi reddit, 

i always read items on this sub bust never thought i'd be posting on it, especially about this...

so here's the context, my girlfriends sisters wedding was on the weekend. they were having a fairly low key wedding and i offered to help where i could, setting up the reception area etc which was all fine. i work at a gym so we have a portable pa system with microphone for the group fitness classes. they were going to hire a pa system but i told them to save the money and i'll let them borrow the one from my gym, i set it up so the grooms phone would connect via bluetooth as all he wanted to do was play a spotify playlist throughout the night and use the pa for the speeches. 

on the day everything was going fine, everyone was seated and went quiet for the groom to talk so someone turned the pa system on. this is where it all went horribly wrong... my phone automatically connected to the speaker and started playing what was on my phone last... this happened to be porn from the night before, porn sounds started playing from speaker in front of everyone including the brides and grooms families... i grabbed my phone out of my pocket to stop the sounds, the groom laughed slightly and continued... my girlfriend saw me get out my phone and press pause on it so she clearly knew that porn was coming from my phone. she didn't say anything at the time however i went home and now she isn't responding to any of my messages and i don't know what to do? do i leave it for a few days or keep trying to get in touch with her. any advice would help i don't know what to do...

"why you might consider a trade over college (one real-world perspective). my husband and i are in our early thirties.  neither of us completed high school; we both have geds.  we both come from very financially and emotionally unstable backgrounds.  we have a lot of reasons/excuses to fail in life.  and we did, for a while.

then we found plumbing.  my husband went through his apprenticeship first while i financially held down the fort (driving 18 wheelers, which is a great short term way to earn a good amount of money).  he still made between $12-15/hr throughout his two year apprenticeship, which is a lot better than no dollars per hour, and now he is paid commission and nets about $60/k year.  that is low for this company and he will make more as he gains confidence and experience.

i have now decided to follow in his footsteps and got lucky with a $15/hr position as a completely green apprentice.  as a female, it was very hard to break in with no previous labor experience, but i found a female-owned company that gave me a shot.  i'm 3 months in, 21 to go for my tradesman license.

so, for now, we have a combined net income of about $85k/year, and no debt of any kind.  within two years, that income should rise to $120-$150k very realistically.  more is entirely possible as half the plumbers at the company we both currently work for bring home $90k or more.  also, this is for service (residential) plumbing, not commercial or union.  you can make great money in both of those arenas as well (especially union if you're in a good state for it).

i think that most states do not have a tradesman license, so in that case, your apprenticeship would be 4 years to get your journeyman.  i still think it would be well worth it for a lot of people.  

i just thought i would make a post giving some people a first-hand, real world example of making it without a college degree or any student loan debt.  and the job prospects are fantastic.  there are no plumbers in my city that look for a job for more than a few days... and they have multiple offers to choose from.  the fact is that there are not enough plumbers to go around, and that is true of a lot of trades.  the job growth in plumbing over the next 20 years is double the national average.

unless you are disabled, there are no excuses.  and yes, ladies, you can do it, too.  i do.  i'm 5'1"" and weigh 118 lbs and i do it.  i have trouble helping lift water heaters into and out of attics, and the company tries to keep me off water heaters when possible, but i still do it.  yes, it will be harder.  but no one ever got anywhere by whining about fairness or difficulty.

"by not wearing a bra. today was a lounging, do-nothing day. i (22) watched some netflix in the living room while my brother (24) played games in his room and my older brother (27) had work. the evening came, my brother came home from work and went to talk with my other brother in his room. 

my mom called to ask what ingredients we had around the house so she can pick up stuff for dinner. an hour later she called to let me know she'll be home soon and my brothers and i have to dispute who has to help her bring groceries in. 

i went to my brothers, ""hey, you two have to pick which one of you have to help mom bring groceries in. she'll be home in 5 minutes."" i walked away like i was so clever, not including myself as an option. 

""why doesn't she help?"" i hear one say to the other. ""i dunno,"" the other says. 

a few minutes pass and the two of them came out of the room and approached me on the couch. 
""you grab the arms, i'll grab the legs?"" 
""yup.""

my older brother grabbed my ankles and the other my arms. i made it a little difficult though, i stiffened (which is probably easier) and i crossed my arms holding my elbows close to my torso so he didnt have anywhere to hold except a poor grip on my shoulders. 

being the weak noodle i am, i couldn't hold my arms in long enough. he grabbed my upper arms and they carried me toward the stairs to the front door. i half expected they wouldn't bring me outside, but i knew they would go all the way even when i had no jacket or shoes.

i didnt want to be carried awkwardly down the stairs so as we got closer, i struggled. i kicked my legs with little effort because i didnt want to hurt anyone, and since that didnt really work i had an idea. risky. i lifted my arms straight up so my brothers hands would lose grip an drop me. 

i dropped slowly since he was still trying to hold me with my arms up (i was wearing a long sleeve bunched at my elbows) but as i hit the floor i realized my shirt had lifted. my sleeves must have been pulled off my arms, lifting the rest.

it was over. my ankles were released. 

i put my now freed hands down over my chest and feel my nipple. yup. the brother by my feet definitely saw. i noticed he was looking away at the moment, but i was sure he saw when it happened. 

thankfully i am small chested, so i'm not as embarrassed as someone else would be. 
but it is still awkward to think about.

p.s. sorry bro....

"there was a girl with cancer in my high school. when i was in 9th and 10th grade there was a girl at our school with cancer, she was totally bald and never wore a wig, everyone was always extra nice to her as you could imagine.

 i only had one class with her where we set in desk clumps of two, so i can't say how she acted with other people but she was a total bitch to me. every time i tried to talk to her and be friendly she would find a way to laugh at me and be rude, and whenever i answered a question in class she would be quick to tell me how stupid i sounded. 

i could go on about her but in short this girl made me dread my 6th period everyday and i knew i could never say anything back to her or complain because she would play her cancer card and make me the bad guy despite whatever she did, she even smirked sometimes when she said particularly mean things like she knew i couldn't do shit.

toward the end of 10th grade i found the seat next to me empty and our teacher announced she needed to stay at the hospital full time because of her deteriorating health, i could barely contain my joy.

"by diving into a pool headfirst, degloving my skull, and breaking my neck in 3 places.. update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cfbo0i/tifu_by_diving_into_a_pool_headfirst_degloving_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

as per usual this didn't happen today but this past saturday. i (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. one of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. so we hop out and me, being the genius that i am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. i go to take a running leap in and as i'm pushing off the deck, i feel my foot slip. i end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. i come to as i'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause i need to breath, but they don't respond. most of my friends see me and think i'm joking, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. they stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. in another incredible bout of luck, once i'm stabilized on the deck i can move my legs again. friends call an ambulance (to which i am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks us healthcare prices) and once i get to the hospital i'm placed in the trauma icu and ct scanned. i then find out i've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. and now i get bed rest and at least 3 months in a c collar. so yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks! 

tldr: dove in the shallow end, wrecked my neck like a hydraulic press

"for forbidding my father in law from seeing my kids until he stops his behavior. my father in law is the king of passive aggressive comments and passing judgement on other people's lives. he particularly disapproves of the fact that i work, send the kids to daycare, and expect my husband to contribute to the household equally in spite of the fact that he makes more than i do. if my father in law had it his way, i would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

his recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. if i buy my husband a gift, fil says, ""is it really a gift if you're spending his money?"" if i pay for my fil's coffee, he says, ""well, really your husband is paying for this."" it's annoying and frustrating. i tried being snarky back, didn't work. i tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what i was talking about.

the final straw was that my kids have started saying it. i mentioned to my husband that i was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing. my husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time! apparently he's taken to telling the kids behind my back that i'm wasting my husband's money on myself every time that i buy anything for myself. one of my kids straight up called me greedy and selfish.

i'm livid and i want to ban my father in law from seeing my kids until he admits to what he's been doing, apologizes, and actually stops doing it. my husband is onboard for the most part, but his mother and siblings are telling us that this is just how he is and it's not that bad and we can just teach our kids otherwise. are we assholes if we kick him out of our kids lives until he stops being such a jerk and poisoning my kids against me?",3

"""hidden"" costs of buying a home and how to prepare for them.. i see a lot of people talking about the ""hidden"" expenses of buying a home.  while many things in life are uncertain, you can still plan for the most common scenarios.  i'll be listing big ticket items below that a lot of people don't budget for, the average cost, and the average life expectancy.  a house is likely the most expensive purchase you will ever make so you want to do your research before hand.  two things to note before i begin:

1. unexpected things can happen no matter how well you plan.  my 17 year old tree got knocked down during a windstorm 2 weeks after i bought my house.  my fence was fairly new and should have had a decade left in it, but trees are bigger than fences.  as mr. gump once said, ""shit happens.""

2. these prices all vary massively.  i aggregated averages from various sites, but just because the median price is 7500 doesn't mean you won't be paying between 2k and 30k.  i'll explain what to look for cost wise for each item, but remember that every scenario is unique so you need to do research for your specific circumstance.  now let's get started.

**roof**

this is the most expensive one for most people.  the average cost of a roof is $7500 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 20 years.  this varies greatly based on the material it is made out of, the size, and the climate you are in.  the best way to get the most out of your roof is to keep it clean of things like moss build-up.  i bought a 17 year old home.  if the roof was the original i'd be looking at a huge cost in the not so distant future.  luckily mine was almost brand new, which is a sigh of relief for any homeowner.

**furnace**

the average cost of a furnace is $3000 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 18 years.  this varies based on the brand you have and the climate you are in.  the best way to get the most out of your furnace is to change filters on time and not use it when it's not needed.  unlike my roof, my furnace was an original with the house.  knowing it was on it's last years of life i upped my emergency fund by a few thousand dollars for when the sucker died.  (rip 2016, made it 21 years!)

**central air**

the average cost of a central air unit is $4000 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 18 years.  this varies based on the brand you have, the size, and the climate you are in.  someone buying a unit for a 1200sq foot home in maine is naturally going to spend less than someone buying for a 2500 sq foot home in arizona.  (assuming people in maine even have them?)  the best way to get the most out of your ac is to not use it when it's not needed.  i had same story with ac unit as furnace.  they died about 6 months apart, but since i'd been planning for that for a few years it wasn't too devastating of a hit to me.

**wood fence**

the average cost of a wooden fence is $25 dollars per sq ft.  the average life expectancy is 12 years.  this quite a bit based on the material you use and the climate.  also if you don't like wood the cost for other materials will change a lot.  this is the first item on the list that i will say you can save money on by doing the labor yourself.  without expertise you don't want to mess with building a roof or installing an ac or furnace.  fences aren't that bad though if you're relatively handy and you can cut the cost on half.

**washer/dryer**

the average cost of a washers and dryers is $500 dollars each.  the average life expectancy is 10 years.  this varies based on the brand and size.  if you want a behemoth washer that is also basically a computer you'll be paying a lot more than a normal sized with with 2 knobs on it for heat and time.  make sure to clear the damn lint trap for your dryer!

**fridge**

the average cost of a refrigerator is $1100 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 14 years.  this varies based on the brand and size.  barring something obvious like leaving it open for 16 weeks in a row there isn't really a way to keep it alive longer.  just make sure you go catch it if it's running.

**deck repair**

the average cost of deck repair is $1500.  the average life expectancy is 15 years.  this varies based on the size of the deck and the extent of repairs needed.  this is also one that you can save a lot of money if you do it yourself.  as for a new deck... you'll have to price that out yourself because it has a wider range than pretty much any of the other items based on size and materials.

**sprinkler system**

the average cost of a new sprinkler system is $3000.  the average life expectancy is 15 years if you don't go cheapo.  this varies based on the size of the yard, climate, and how many installations you want.  repairs to a system can be 100-1000 dollars based on what is damage and where.

**hot water heater**

last item!  the average cost of a hot water heater is $1500 dollars.  the average life expectancy is 10 years.  this varies based on the brand and size.  a good way to expand the life of a hot water heater is to not drive your car into it like my cousin once did.  (he did it to his own, not mine thankfully.)

**conclusion**

so, these are all the items my realtor ran through with me.  hope it helps at least someone out there!

in the 8 years i've been here i've had expected replacements to hot water, ac, furnace, washer, and dryer.  i've had unexpected replacements to the fence.  everything else is still within it's normal life span so this list has been great for me minus one stupid wind storm.",10

""you've missed a payment, would you like to update your card"" and i have to explain and they apologize and say the manager should call the next day, except ....

"by finding out my dad is dating a milf i took home from a bar over a year ago and slept with multiple times.. hey reddit,

throwaway because i really don't want this on my main and it getting linked back to me. tl:dr at the bottom.

obligatory the technically happened over a year ago but it hit me today at lunch.

okay so i'll start off by saying my mother and father divorced 5 and a half years ago, my mom has remarried but my dad has been very hit and miss with his luck dating. when he first started dating women i'd always get introduced to them early and then they would disappear off the face of the earth so i asked my dad to not introduce me to anyone until they are serious and have been together for at least 3 or 4 months. 

a bit of back story so y'all can see where this is going. last july to be exact me and some buddies were out at a bar and being young competitive men saw some older ladies out at the bar (mid 40's) and had a bit of a joke around that none of us would be able to take any of them home. well about 10 drinks and a few hours later our little laugh turned into a serious competition. we went over introduced ourselves, had small talk about what they are doing out, were a bit flirty etc and hit them up for a bit of a dance. i got talking to an absolutely fit, stunning dark haired lady who i'll call susan. we were flirting, having a dance and a good time, i got her some drinks and could tell she was having a great time. anyway as the night progressed i thought i'd shoot my shot and see if i could take a milf home, i found out that she had 2 kinds, one who was only a year younger than me. here i am, fulfilling one of my biggest fantasies. so i get a uber for us and she comes back to my apartment. we had really good sex and i got her number the next day after i drove her back to her car. we hooked up 2 more times before i met my current girlfriend.

well a couple of weeks ago my dad calls me and tells me he wants me to meet this woman he has been dating for 5 months. he'd told me a bit about her, including that her name was susan but we live in a pretty big city and i never thought anything of it. somehow of everything he told me nothing registered in my brain. he had said she had 2 kids a similar age to me, and most importantly that they had really hit things off and he really enjoyed her company and wasn't feeling lonely for the first time in years. anyway he asked me to come for lunch today to meet her and was really excited. 

i got to lunch around 15 minutes early and was waiting for my dad and the new lady he's dating to show up, and low and behold i see my dad pull up out the front of the cafe we are having lunch at and see him and the new lady get out of the car. at this point i did the biggest double take of my life, surely it couldn't be...

but it was, my dad, for 4-5 months has been dating the milf i took home from a bar over a year ago. i nearly had a panic attack. as soon as they walked in my dad pointed at the table that i was sitting at and i saw susan's face screw up. she was walking behind my dad and just pulled a face that said ""don't you dare say anything right now"". 

so i sat through the most awkward 45 minute lunch of my life, sweating profusely with my dad asking me if i was alright because i looked sick. i can't even remember what we talked about at lunch because the whole time i realised that me and my dad are tunnel buddies now and i honestly am at a loss for what will even happen next. i want to talk my dad but i can't even imagine the conversation at this stage. i'm hoping susan breaks things off and it doesn't go any further. how the fuck does this even happen, it's like the plot to a bad porn movie!!!

tl:dr - my dad is dating a lady who i have slept with before, she is mid 40's and my dad is early 50's and i can tell he is head over heels for her. just so y'all know i'm 24.

update - so this has blown up and i decided to tell a couple of my buddies to ask what to do. i'll be catching up with dad with some beers to tell him because if the situation was reversed i'd want to know. will update after i've told him.",4
"i failed to stop a stranger from being raped.... remorse

never told anyone this, it happened about a year ago.

so i live in a flat that's in a part of town that has a lot of bars and breweries. in the summer i like keeping my sliding door open and i often stay up quite late at night. as a result i hear rowdy, drunk people shouting and carousing from time to time. 

so i was curled up playing video games really late one night and i hear a loud yelp. sounds like a girl. but i thought ""eh, bars are closing right about now."" then a few moments later it was a shout. but again i ignored it, loud noises, even shouts, were common late at night. besides, i was comfy and engrossed in my game.

..then it was a scream. and, regretfully, i *still stayed put.* i lied to myself thinking ""*i'm tired, and its probably nothing.*"" 20 tense seconds later and i finally hear her voice again, **""raaaaaaapppeeee!!!""** holy shit. this is happening. she's been getting **raped** this entire time. my stomach flipped and dropped. i jumped up from my couch, grabbed my baseball bat, and sprinted out into the parking lot. but it was too late, all i could see was a car screeching out of the far end of the lot. i couldn't even make out the licence plate number.

i could've saved her.

"my brother and i stole a puppy.  this happened in 2003. my brother and i have never told a single soul. there was an article in the local newspaper about a ~~guy~~ asshole who had killed his dog with a spading fork and this asshole happened to live one house over from where my brother stayed at the time. we knew this because the night of the incident the cops was called on this guy by a neighbor who went to investigate the noise and caught him red handed, this neighbor in turn told my brother. he still had a puppy that the spca for some reason never removed from his care. 

bro and i love dogs and are both pretty pissed and want to kick his ass. so about three days after the article we are having drinks one friday night getting ready to go out and the issue comes up. my brother gets this sly look on his face and tells me we need to ~~steal~~ save the dog as we could hear it whimpering and yelping from time to time and we didn't want it going the same way as it's mom. 

we ditched going out and decided to stay in and wait. at around 2 the next morning we put our plan into action. we jumped the wall of the property next door with some meat and made our way to the dog killers house were i jumped the next wall again to get into his property and lured the puppy to me with the meat. it was obviously scared and barked at me but i eventually managed to grab it and get out. 

the poor animal was terribly neglected and infested with parasites. the next morning when my brothers gf walked into his place the pup was clean, fed and sleeping on the sofa. we told her we found him in the road the night before coming home from the club. she of course helped to find it a good home. no regrets",11

fast forward a few weeks and nearly 50 spam calls from telemarketers, i'd completely forgotten about the previous order. i get a call on my phone and i hear an asian woman ask for me, mispronouncing my last name, not unlike many telemarketers. fed up with it i yell ""no, he's not here because he died!""

not even two hours later there's a knock on my door, it was the sweet delivery lady and she brought a free meal for my household as a sympathy gift to help everyone through the ordeal of my death, while telling us not to worry about the bill from the other week.

i had my friend drop off enough money for both meals without explaining it because i felt so bad. i can't explain it to them without sounding racist and now i have to find a new chinese restaurant.

"how do you ever retire at 65 and live to 95 given the power of inflation?. i recently created a retirement spreadsheet using excel and am having a hard time understanding how, given the power of inflation, you could ever retire with relative certainty that'd you'd be ok in the long run. 

suppose you retire at age 65 with optimistically $1.5 million in savings. suppose that generates 5% per year in interest income that you plan to live on = $75k/yr. suppose you pay 30% total income tax on that (fed/state) leaving you with ~$50k/yr or roughly $4,000/mo. clearly today $4,000/mo is plenty to live on comfortably.

but ~30 years from now (i am 36), assuming 3.2% annual inflation, $4,000/mo is worth only about $1,500 in today's dollars. still maybe ok if you live frugally; maybe have a place to live for free at that point (assuming you didn't need your home equity to get to the original $1.5m nest egg). 

but the thing that really has me scratching my head is what if you live to be 95? that $4k/mo is now worth only ~$600/mo. that's tough to live on. and the thing that is even harder for me to understand is how much money it would take to make a material difference — suppose you double the $1.5m nest egg to $3.0m. by 95, that is still only giving you ~$1,200/mo in today's dollars worth of purchasing power?

clearly you might have additional income — ssi and/or work pension etc. but for the sake of simplicity, assume you don't have those additional sources (because 1.5m as a nest egg is a stretch as is, so in coming up with the above numbers, i already shifted them to assume some of that original $4k/mo includes those sources).

how does one responsibly plan to live into deep old age (the universe willing) given the power of inflation? once you stop working and start living on interest income, your dollars seem to devalue rapidly. is the only solution kids/other family support by ppl working who make salaries inflated to 60-years-from-now levels? or just enjoy the first 10-15 years of retirement while your money is still competitive? is the advice on so many finance websites to aim for 1m to 1.5m in retirement savings dated (keyed to today's dollars or even 30 years from now dollars, rather than 40/50/60 years from now dollars)? or the advice that you should save x times your current salary to sustain x quality of life somewhat incomprehensible, since retirement is not a static situation, but rather a dynamic one in which x quality of life takes increasingly more income to sustain every year?

i'd really appreciate any help with reorienting my thinking about this if possible. i thought the retirement spreadsheet drafting process would make me feel more secure, and instead i feel less secure.

tl;dr - draft retirement spreadsheet has me confused as to how one can ever reasonably expect to live 30 years post-retirement on interest income alone without many millions in savings given the power of inflation. please help :)

edit: wow, thank you all so much for the incredible response and wealth of information. to summarize major takeaways: 1) the biggest mistake i made was to assume that i would live entirely off interest income in retirement; rather, most people seem to draw down principal and a 4% draw is very likely to last 30 years, a 3% draw almost certainly will (see trinity study and concept of ""safe withdrawal rate""). 2) i made many assumptions that are too pessimistic: a) tax rate is likely to be something closer to 20%, b) real return (inflation adjusted) is likely to be 3-5% annually, in part because c) 3.2% is likely too high an estimate of inflation (100-year historic average does not take into account modern monetary policy). 3) if possible, try not to assume the equity in your home will become part of the nest egg; great if you can live in the home to reduce housing expenses in retirement. 4) for many, retirement at 65 may be optimistic given increasing life expectancies — consider staying engaged even in part-time work you enjoy beyond that. 5) expenses do tend to go down in retirement, though this may be non-linear (early active years, more sedentary mid-retirement, increased care costs in late retirement). 6) consider ""bond tent"" or similar approach to asset allocation near the retirement age. since poor stock market returns near retirement can cause you to dip into principal in a way that dramatically alters performance throughout retirement, it is a good idea to shift some of your portfolio to bonds near retirement age (see ""sequence of returns"" concept). 7) if an appealing option, consider jurisdictional arbitrage — i.e., make money in a place where wages/income are relatively high and then retire to a place where cost of living is relatively low (tl;dr - work in the us and retire to mexico/south america/southeast asia). 8) lastly, wherever you are on the path to retirement, proceed in the face of inherent uncertainty (even the corrected assumptions above about swrs, future tax rates, real returns, and inflation are not certain), balancing as best you can the ability to hedge risk and plan for the future while also enjoying today. thank you all — spreadsheet updated!",10

"can my parents force a pregnancy test?. my wife was sexually assaulted. she got pregnant, and the baby could be mine or the rapist's. we decided to keep the baby and raise it as mine. we never want to have a paternity test done on the baby because this could be devastating to her relationship with my wife.

i'm a massive moron, and after my daughter was born, i let slip to my parents that she might not be mine biologically. i tried to backtrack, but my parents kept pushing and pushing until my wife sat them down and explained the situation. they do not believe her. they think she cheated and that she is using me.

now my parents have approached me about taking a paternity test. they want me to contest paternity and leave my wife. i do not want to. i made a commitment to my wife and daughter and i stand by it. i trust my wife, but my parents don't. they told me that if i refuse, they will go to court and compel me to do a paternity test to absolve me of responsibility for the baby. they want me to leave my wife regardless.

"update: would it be okay/weird if i 20f asked out the stranger 24?m who saved me from being kidnapped out to dinner?. previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9c521z/would_it_be_okayweird_if_i_20f_asked_out_the/)

hi guys!

i'm back with the long-awaited update. but first, thank you all who responded on my first post and gave their advice! i definitely wouldn't of asked if it weren't for all the positive comments!

a lot of you suggested that i just shoot him a text and give him an update in terms of my situation and then ask him if we could meet up for coffee (dinner seemed too much like a date) so i could return his sweatshirt and thank him. that's basically exactly what i did. 

i shot him a text and told him that i had filed the police report and that the police will be in contact with me. then i asked him (in a double text) if i could take him out to coffee to thank him and return his sweatshirt. he actually didn't respond for a good day and i was really starting to feel like i'd totally overstepped but then he did! he first told me that it was great that i filed the report and then he asked me how i was feeling. he also said that i didn't have to thank him and that he was just doing what anyone would've done if they were in that situation, but that a quick coffee sounded good. so we scheduled to have coffee on a saturday morning. 

going into our meeting, i was actually super nervous for some reason and ended up being 15 minutes early. so i sat for about 10 minutes, fidgeting with his sweater and waiting for him to show up. to be honest, i wasn't even that sure i knew what he looked like. the entire night is still pretty jumbled and when he was walking me back, i barely paid any attention to him (it was also super dark) since i was just replaying what happened over and over again in my head. i just remembered he was tall and had a nice smile. 

then, this really tall dude walks in, scans the shop, sees me and then gives me an awkward smile and waves. i didn't know what to say after our initial niceties, so i just blurted out, ""woah, your eyes are actually blue, i thought they were brown haha."" i wanted to crawl into a hole after i said that but he laughed and said, ""yea they can be deceiving in the dark."" then we ordered coffee (he refused to let me pay) and we sat down. first things first, i gave him back his sweatshirt and he thanked me. we ended up chatting for two hours about mostly random stuff, like our classes, our summer, the office (which is also my favorite show), politics, music, etc. i also asked him why he decided to call me ""maddie"" when he was trying to save me and he told me he read an article somewhere that if you pretend to know a stranger who's in trouble, you're most likely to help without escalating the situation or getting you or the other person hurt. 

so yes, he's sweet and caring and devilishly handsome and we really clicked. but he didn't seem that interested in me, not that it was a date. so we then went about five days with no contact until i came across a meme about the office and decided on a whim to send it to him. it ended up being a good decision since we ended up talking until 1:00 am. next morning, i was feeling bold again and after much debating, i sent him a text that said, ""hey, can i please take you out to lunch? coffee didn't count since you didn't even let me pay for you."" 

he said yes and this time i managed to successfully pay for our meal. i wore a nice sundress to lunch and he said, ""i love that dress! you look really good!"" we had a really great time again but as we were leaving the restaurant i realized that he left his phone on the chair so i grabbed it and gave it to him. (this is important later on). 

about two weeks later (he went out of town but we were still sporadically texting), he sends me a text that said, ""hey, can i take you out to dinner to thank you for grabbing my phone?"" omg. he's too cute. (for those of you who might not have caught on, he was mimicking how i asked him out). anyway, of course i said yes and now we're going out to dinner tomorrow night. 

ahhh i like him a lot but i have no idea how he feels about me. maybe i'll ask him over dinner tomorrow. :) but so far, that's what has happened. 

tl;dr: i asked him out to coffee! then i asked him out to lunch! then he asked me out to dinner!

"for not helping to pay for my sister's college, even though i could easily afford to?. i'm 29, my sister is 27.

we're polar opposites. i've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. my sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. she tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. 

recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. she currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.

on the other hand, i'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. naturally, my parents think i should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. they say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but i'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.

i shut down the idea immediately. in my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. my gf and i plan on getting married soon and i don't want to waste money on my sister's education.

as you can imagine i'm now seen as the greedy brother who won't help out family... even though my sister has never done anything to help me.

"if i (37f) tell my husband (38m) that he can follow the event dress code or just stay home?. my side of the family is very close and ~~my~~ our niece (call her n) is getting married in a few months. the ceremony is halfway across the country and i've been saving for several months so our family of 5 can fly out for it. the venue is upscale and beautiful.

the ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the ""cocktail"" definition here(https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

husband doesn't *dress up*. he wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. he wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (that was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

when i broke the news about n's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""no. i'm not wearing a suit. i guess i'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

i told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. i added ""nice priorities there, honey.""

* my mom and brother (n's dad) said yta - just ask n if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* n's mom says i'm nta, but my delivery could have been better (i disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* i don't have very many friends to ask, and i'm not asking n. weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

recently my wife's best friend noticed my tattoo (it's on my chest so usually covered up) and she asked my wife if i had a tattoo of my stepdaughters name. 

my wife said no, and her friend is convinced this is a huge sad imbalance and is unfair to my daughter etc. she told my wife this, and my wife agrees now and thinks that i should get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name to be fair. 

i don't want to do it at all, and i keep saying no, but my wife thinks a 'real dad' would get tattoos of both. i got a bit upset at that comment and told her i was a real bloody dad. i asked my daughter and she said 'i don't want a tattoo of my name, but if you are getting a tattoo for me i want you to get a cat' .... i love her very much but i'm not getting a freaking cat on me either.

edit: a user pointed out i should explain why i got my tattoo. i got his name because he was premature and they told us he had a high probability of dying, the fact he didn't was a medical miracle. i was celebrating the first year of his birth because that was the biggest hurdle to get through. never saw any need to get any tattoos after that.",3
"sc ra keeps interrupting sex because i'm gay (update). hello again legal advice. this is a follow up to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9bfpx8/sc_ra_keeps_interrupting_sex_because_im_gay/

i've got good news: the ra has been removed! i went to the residence coordinator and he called someone above him in the housing department, who told us to write down every incident i remember for housing to review, then go to the title 9 coordinator. it took awhile to get through all the paperwork, but the process was a lot less intimidating than i thought it would be.

the ra was fired and given the option of either moving to an empty room in one of the old dorms or moving off campus within 30 days. he chose to move out and stay with his girlfriend after a week, which i didn't realize he had since i've seen other women come into his room but i don't feel like stirring that pot. after i made the report, he stopped banging on the door when my bf was over, but every time he saw me i could feel him staring daggers into me. he also started doing petty stuff like ""accidentally"" knocking my towel onto the floor of the shower room and leaving it there. he left me an apology letter at one point, but it was definitely not sincere. i could've moved to another dorm temporarily but decided it would be too much work because they gave him a 30 day deadline and he started packing the tuesday after.

yesterday the new ra finished moving in, and after talking to him about all that happened i think we're going to get along fine! :)

the residence coordinator said that housing had done all they could do, any further action would be done as a result of the title 9 complaint, which might take several months to complete. and for those wondering, yes it is a public college and there is no no-sex policy (i looked through the housing contract and couldn't find anything except rules against sexual assault and discrimination based on sexual orientation), i should've said that in the original post but it blew up and was locked by the time i saw those comments.

"our emergency fund: a love story. from the time i was old enough to understand what money was my mom drove two things into my head:

1. always live below your means
2. always have a rainy day fund

i took it to heart, but this month was the first time i really learned just how important those lessons were. 

my husband and i are in the process of buying our first house. we are doing it ""old school"" with conventional, 20% down. we have been saving for years and after some search found the perfect place at about half the cost of what the bank told us we could afford. it fits our needs and is well within the budget we set for ourselves. 20% down plus closing and general moving expenses means we had to save a lot of cash, and we insisted we have that money available on top of our standard 6-month emergency fund. 

everything was sunshine and rainbows until 12 days before closing. we file our taxes and due to a change in our financial situation wind up owing the irs $1800. great, pay it from the emergency fund and be done with it. 12 hours later, we learn there was an unexpected death in the family. we live 900 miles away, so that means a last second trip. $1000 in suits/dresses, 3 days off work, travel expenses tbd. but that is okay, because we have an emergency fund. all told it adds up to about $4000 we weren't planning on having to spend this month. 

without our emergency fund, we would have had to skip a funeral for a loved one, setup payment plans with the irs, or worse, had to delay the purchase of our home. instead we will buckle down on our spending for the next few months and recoup what spent from our ""rainy day"" fund. when it rains, it pours. do yourself a favor and save yourself some stress, have an emergency fund.


**edit:** a lot of people seem to have an issue with spending ~$1k on clothing. well, here is a breakdown:

$100 - a new, quality dress for me that fit off the rack, is appropriate for a funeral and a host of other functions. i love it. it will last for years.

$800 - two (buy one get one free deal) designer suits, two dress shirts (bogo), two ties (bogo), and rush tailoring on one of the suits for my husband. was it expensive? yes, but they will fit him a whole lot better than the $150 h&m alternative and will also last for years. 

$100 - a large black umbrella, a new belt, a shoe shine kit, other small necessaries  

we had been planning to get him a new suit for a while anyway, now he has two. for every wedding, funeral, cocktail party or work event we go to for the next several years we are set. saving and being frugal matters, i obviously know and care about that. spending $1000 to not look like a schlub at a funeral and to have our formal clothing needs satisfied for several years was worth it to us.

"my (18f) parents are disowned me and kicked me out because i accidentally got pregnant. edit: sorry for that glaring typo in the title.

this entire situation blew up so fast in my face that i'm still reeling.

i should probably preface this by saying that my parents are extremely strict asian immigrant parents. it's always been education and academics before love and support. i grew up being physically beat for getting a single ""b"" grade on my report card and having to give my mother my passwords to all of my accounts. nevertheless, i obeyed their every command. i graduated just last week in the top 10% of my class and am going to brown university on an almost full-ride (more on that later in regards to the current situation) this fall. 

following my college acceptances, i probably breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life. my parents finally had nothing to complain about since i fulfilled their biggest dream for me: ""to get into an ivy league school."" all was good for about a month. my parents finally stopped reading my text messages, tracking my every move, etc. i was free to go out with friends, spend time with my *secret* boyfriend, and just enjoy being a high schooler. 

my boyfriend and i have been together since last summer, so almost a year now. my parents had their suspicions about us in the beginning but i brushed it off and faked my way into making them believe he was just a friend. but after i committed to brown and they seemed happy enough, i became more lax about hanging out with him and i think they figured it out. 

we started being sexually active in december but have always been incredibly careful about using protection. the only time where i'm not 100% sure we were careful was during spring break when we went to mexico with a couple of our friends and got drunk and had sex. it would make a lot of sense if that's when it happened. now, i fully understand that we were both stupid and should have exercised a lot more caution. it's our fault completely and i'm not saying otherwise.

fast-forward to about a week ago. i'm starting to get weird period-like symptoms, but no period. at that point, i honestly just knew. it was like this weird gut feeling and i freaked the fuck out. my boyfriend was incredibly supportive and drove me over to his house where he'd already gotten tests and had me take two of the pretty expensive ones. all positive. i broke down and cried for hours. 

when i got home, i was still visibly upset despite trying my best to hide it. but i wasn't acting carefully or thinking rationally because of everything that happened. i spoke to him explicitly about the situation over a messaging app that my mom has my password to. in retrospect, she definitely suspected that something happened between me and him (probably a break-up) so she logged on to read our messages. 

the very next day, i wake up to the sound of my mom lugging all of my stuff out of my room and throwing it onto our lawn. i get up and ask what the fuck she's doing and she's crying and calling me the nastiest stuff in chinese like, ""you're a whore, just kill yourself,"" or, ""i should have gave you up for adoption you useless piece of shit."" and other completely ridiculous things like, ""now you're a prostitute and no longer a virgin, no good boy will ever want to marry you now."" 

i was begging her to stop but the more i did the angrier she got. she was breaking the majority of my stuff, tearing up my work/papers, smashing my photographs, etc. all i could to was call my boyfriend and have him pick me up. 

it's been three days since that happened. i've picked up all of my stuff, at least the stuff that isn't irreparably damaged. my mother or father is not returning any of my calls but continuously sends me brutal text messages about how much of a failure and disappointment i am and how i turned into a prostitute. she also communicated that she will no longer be paying for my education at brown and that i will never be allowed to call her my mother and have any interaction with her. my yearly tuition not including personal expenses is around $15,000. i have about $10,000 in my own personal checking account from just working a few jobs throughout high school. however, that's not counting the birthday money i've received and the money that my grandfather left me when he passed. those are in a separate account being controlled by my mother. there's about $75,000 in there and i have no idea how i'm going to get it back.

i'm currently living with my boyfriend. his parents are at a complete loss as to why my parents are behaving this way and i am so ashamed. they've been nothing but supportive of us, even going as far as to offer to pay for whatever choice i end up making about the baby. we've both decided that i'll get an abortion and he's currently working on figuring all of that out while i'm still worrying about my entire fucking future. 

i don't know why but i just feel so incredibly alone at this moment despite having my boyfriend and his family. i can't my best friends because i don't want this to spread and i obviously have no familial support. i'm just so lost. what should i even do at this point? 

tl;dr: strict asian parents disowned me and kicked me out of the house after snooping and finding out i was pregnant. they've cut off all contact and refuses to pay for my college tuition. i fully plan on attending brown this fall after getting the abortion, but i have no money. i'm at a complete loss as to what to do. any advice appreciated.",7

"for telling my husband i won't take my stepdaughter on holiday again?. i have two children from a previous relationship. danielle (11) and elliot (7). my husband john loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, alicia, from a previous relationship. we've been married four years, but i've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. 

over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to spain for three weeks. john was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. however, when he told alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which i did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. 

it all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, i couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. she then phoned up her mum crying saying i was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' she also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. 


we had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. she was cuddling with one of them, and when elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. as her guardian on the trip i was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. she threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if i won't let her have fun. 

finally, alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. i stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. 

when we got back i told john how difficult alicia had been throughout the trip and said that i wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. he insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but i insisted on speaking to alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. she defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. i was shocked, but after john and leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if i get to know her and things like that. 

i've not said that i'll never be in the same room as her again, i've just said that i won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but john says that i'm overreacting, and that i should give her another chance, which i have no intention of doing.

update: thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. while i still stand by my decision and won't take alicia on holiday unless john is there with me, a lot of people said that i haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), i think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. it is of course leanne's decision but it isn't something i'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. as some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why i told john that i will make the effort to get to know alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as i can.",3
"for breaking up with my girlfriend over ""consent required""?. before any of you start freaking out at me, i want to say that i fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and i would never in my life think about treating another person that way. now that thats out of the way, the moment.  

i've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\~ months.  in this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  we've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  this goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   this has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  we've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.

now, on this last friday, i went over to her apartment.  we put on some stupid netflix documentary that i can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  i got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  i do the business and make her feel good.  after this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  i try to talk to her because i can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  i tell her that i know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then i should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.

""i just feel like you kind of use me.  you never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.""

now, of course i understand the sentiment.  i'm not always the most romantic of person, i try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but i can see where shes coming from.  still, i was \visibly confused\ at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that i never listen to her.

i point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  she gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  i tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  

at this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that i'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless i ask first and she gives me permission.

i say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like i'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because i want to touch the woman i've been dating for 8 months.

""well maybe you are!"" she says angrily.  at this point, i'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  i just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  she throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time i just leave and go home.

not five minutes after i walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, i think it over for a minute and decide that i'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.

&#x200b;

i woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because i ""broke up with the perfect woman because i wasn't allowed to grope her whenever i want.""

so, am i the asshole here?  i feel like i'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that i've missed?  am i the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  

&#x200b;

and before you start yelling at me (even though i'm sure half of you have already started typing) i respect a persons right to say no.  if i touch my girlfriend, or any girl i'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, i'll stop, no question.  i just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.

""...because you don't personally like it."" and  ""...downvote based just on the person that posted it."" are the real reasons people downvote. in the same vein, the upvote button is usually an ""agree"" button (not on this subreddit necessarily but on a lot of them). reddit should just admit to the biases its users have against each other.",6
"the reason it's looked down upon for a woman to sleep with multiple men rather than vice versa is because it actually takes skill for a man to get with a woman.. now i want to start this by saying i don't give a shit who fucks who how many times, but it's obvious why men are slapped up and high-fived when they bring home a one night stand vs a woman being called a whore when she has multiple partners.

women are picky af. men aren't. it's in our genetics.

for a man to bring home a woman, even a promiscuous one, you need some game. you gotta have -

1. good physical presentation, usually how you're dressed + how you actually look
2. you usually have to spend some amount of money.
3. you need to be able to produce good conversation that separates you from other men.
4. you usually need to be a couple levels above that woman (woman is a 6, guy is an 8)
5. a woman will probably ask for your occupation or field of study. a man will not care if you're a vomit collector (yes this is a job).

if a woman truly wants, she can just walk into a bar on friday night, spend about 5 minutes scoping out the room, go up to a dude she likes, speak to him for another 10 minutes, and take him home while both are completely sober.

a man doing this? no way. it's like an epic quest that you invest most of your night into. and if you did a *very good* job, with the help of some alcohol (not wasted but slight buzz), you *may* get lucky.

there have been dating app experiments where they take a 10/10 man vs a 10/10 woman, and at the end the man who is a complete adonis has 200/1000 matches, and the woman has 800+.

"advice: accidentally got paid 80 hrs of overtime. i get paid biweekly (924.25) and work 40 hrs a week. i recently got paid for 80 hrs of normal work and 80 hrs of overtime (2075.82). it was someone's mistake working on the payroll. once they realized their mistake, i was paid 0.00 for the next paycheck and 498.60 for the next. a total of 2574.42 for the 3 paychecks. 

i would normally make 2772.75 for 3 paychecks. so this is a difference of 198.33 due to having more taxes taken out of the large amount i was accidentally paid. i've been trying to figure out what to do about it. i would like to be paid the 198.33 but the lady i talked to said the taxes have been paid and there's nothing she can do. 

i've been trying to get this resolved. the people managing my paycheck accused me of intentionally doing this and that i tried to hide the mistake. i notified my boss the day i was paid and we couldn't get in touch with the payroll people for a week. so i don't know if there's nothing that can be done or if they just don't want to do anything. 

should i just let this go? or do i file it when i do my taxes? 

edit: thanks so much everyone! this is my first job/ the first time i will be filing taxes so i just wasn't clear on everything. as long as i'll get it back at the end i'm okay with waiting. i now realize that i was paid the same and taxed differently and there's nothing payroll can do now to fix this. 

edit 2: wow thank you all so much for your input! i'm surprised this got so much attention for such a small issue. i will worry about the 198 when i file my taxes! also i will read everyone's comments tonight and reply to them. 

edit 3: okay so while i was at work i spoke to a lady briefly and she just kept telling me there wasn't anything they could do to fix the problem and the money was already sent away from the initial pay check. my boss was calling me at the same time so i told her i had to go. i haven't gotten the chance to call her back today. i just got an email saying my case number has been closed! (they gave me a case number when i reported a problem) i feel like they're trying to hide something. not exactly my issue but i'm sure they have messed up bigger things in the past and they don't want me to draw attention? i'm okay with just letting all of it go. but it's ridiculous that they closed my case without me getting a chance to talk  ",10

"for confronting my kids private school teacher about blue blood?. so this happened about a year ago but i'm curious. my wife said i drug it out too far and was an asshole. 

so my kid comes homes from school telling me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. so i was excited too and asked him what. he said ""we learned our blood is blue today!"". 

i felt a little bad but said to him ""you know i was told that as a kid too, but i've learned that's actually not true."". i said i can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. we get home and i show him and he believes me. 

the next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. his teacher tells him no, i am the one who is wrong not him. my kid even said he believes his teacher. so i show my son more proof that i am right, but he is still skeptical.  

the next day i compose a nice email, not rude. simply stating i told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you told him i am incorrect. i give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  

he emails me back saying i am still incorrect. at this point my wife asks me to drop it. i am upset and i don't want to drop it. as of now my own kid does not believe me, even after showing him proof. 

so i email the teacher again and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because i cannot produce anything showing he is correct. he finally relents and says i must be right. 

but at this point, i now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so my son will believe me.  my wife asked me to please stop but i didn't. i emailed him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so they don't go through life with incorrect information. 

he did tell the kids he was wrong and that's the end of that. 

now i feel that i have taught my son a few good lessons.  a) it's ok to question things including those authorities b) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence c) it's ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof, it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.

was i an asshole for dragging it out?

edit. to those calling me an asshole? what is the best way to handle this then? i'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?

edit: well this blew up. i'll accept my nta. but these people telling me my reasons for doing this are self centered? nope. couldn't care less. but i wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.

final edit: showed the wife this. she said that i was correct in following through. but i was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy at home for days.

"it isn't ""amazing"" that a person with disabilities half-asses something able-bodied people do.. i figure this one will make me sound like a real jerk, but hear me out.

it seems like every day i see some video on facebook with sappy music where some person with a disability performs a feat that a person with that disability doesn't typically perform. it leads to a bunch of congratulation and applause by everyone. but it never makes sense to me. 

i think creating tasks and events for someone with limitations is perfectly viable. special olympics? hell yeah. the story of a blind kid being allowed to play football on a team of able-bodied kids? come on. 

i recently saw a video of a girl with cerebral palsy who took up boxing. cue amazement from everyone. but she's having people cater specifically to her disability, and the message is supposed to be that she overcame the odds... 

except that all she actually does it flail around on her knees with gloves on while someone kneels down so she can hit the hand pads... kinda. she hasn't overcome anything because she's not actually achieving a task beyond awkwardly slapping her hands about. it isn't really boxing, so calling it that is kind of silly. she's still not ""normal"", and no one is fooled into believing she is. it's a spectacle, and i'm not impressed - i'm cringing. 

i once saw a video of a guy with a severe physical limitation completing an obstacle course of sorts. except he didn't. he was pulled and carried through most of it while someone filmed the pitiful experience. there was nothing inspirational about it because nothing was actually overcome. he just created a spectacle and inconvenienced a bunch of people who ultimately felt sorry for him. the course wasn't made for his limitations, and he accomplished nothing. 

hell, i have severe back and nerve issues, so i can't lift much weight. therefore, i don't work in a field that requires it, and i sometimes have my wife carry heavier items. them's the breaks. 

and please understand, i'm not implying that i believe that people with disabilities are less of a human or that they deserve any less respect or love. but every being on the planet has built-in limitations. there's nothing wrong with living within them, and sorta-kinda doing something you can't really do isn't impressive or inspirational. it's awkward. 

tldr:

a disabled person isn't ""overcoming a disability"" by creating a spectacle and pretending they can do what able-bodied people can do, and the ""amazement"" people feel when seeing someone half-ass accomplish something like this is just a more optimistic form of pity. they're well aware that the disabled person isn't truly accomplishing the task in any realistic manner, and so is the disabled person. 

don't pretend to be something you're not. if you can't truly accomplish a task the real way, it's not made for your limitations, and that's okay. you're still awesome.",6
"lied to my parents(divorced) about why i didn't want to walk at my college graduation. they died 6 months later.. i don't even know if this is the correct sub. whatever, this has been weighing on my soul for the last year. long story.

growing up, i knew my parents were never going to last. four separations throughout my adolescence told me that. my parents were polar opposites. my father was attempting to build a business from scratch. he worked his body to the bone. his poured everything into it. i see now that this was his way of giving everything he had to my mother and myself. but he had a hardened exterior. his expectations for me and my mother were exhaustively high. this didn't bode well with the type of person my mother was. she was sensitive. my father's world was his business. hers was me. the only child. i see now she gave everything she had to me. every life lesson she held. every bit of wit and intelligence she attempted to show me. she needed support and love. things my father wasn't able to give.

&#x200b;

fast forward to the day after my high school graduation. my mom bailed. i didn't blame her. i see why. but it was utter chaos at home. my dad's tough exterior was broke in ways i didn't think was possible. she never spoke to him again after that day. i know she wanted to move on and start new.

&#x200b;

college came and went with usual successes and mistakes that often posses the average 18-22 year old. my father was so in love with my mother yet. it was so genuine. it's so sad what it took for him to show it. my mother was mentally checked out though. never brought up my father and i sure wasn't going to discuss it. with that being said, she made some poor life choices after the divorce. career-wise and relationship-wise. mistakes that carry consequences that can't be undone.

&#x200b;

my graduation day was looming. i couldn't put it on my mother to have my dad there. i thought it was so unfair to either one to have to miss it. i decided not to walk . my friends, girlfriend, everyone else did. i remember watching the ceremony and feeling so alone.

&#x200b;

the mistakes finally caught up with my mother after graduation. her life was in full-blown tailspin mode. i should haven saw it coming. but i didn't. it happened. suicide. the whole nine yards. 22. mother dead. that shit sticks with you, let me tell you.

&#x200b;

my father was the best father he had every been in his life after that. we had such a good relationship. something i didn't even think was possible growing up. we cried, hugged, shared fears. everything i wanted growing up. it was as blissful as could be, given the circumstances. but fate had one more cruel card to deal. my dad a very routine surgery lined up a few months after my mother passed. you know what's next. he was the 1 in 2 million surgeries that resulted in death. now here i was at 22, without either parent.

&#x200b;

after 5 years, i'm strong. my parent's gave me everything they could, in their own respective ways. i have my mother's compassion and love, but my father's strength and determination. i've never been depressed. people have it far worse than myself. the 22 years i received will be forever cherished with them.

&#x200b;

but of all the things feel horrible about...beyond all others is the moment that i stripped away from all of 3 of us. it would have been the first time in 4 years we all would have been together. it gained nothing. all because my 22 year old self was worried how my parent's would respond to seeing each other. i never apologized for this action. it was so selfish. above all other actions, this weighs the most. it was so self-inflicted. actions are permanent. this one is my largest mistake.

"by encouraging my husband in bed and ruining sex for the day nsfw. so as usual, this wasn't today but last weekend.
after a busy workweek where me and my husband had been coming home, and pretty much passing out at the end of the day, we figured a saturday afternoon would be the perfect time for some quality alone time.
i'd been teasing him for the morning whilst we did general household chores and finally dragged him upstairs mid afternoon to get down to business! 

everything started off brilliantly, the clothes got thrown, things got hot and quickly led into some excellent 69ing.
now, my husband is deft of finger and pretty quickly had me moaning with pleasure and a very intense orgasm. 
we quickly switched to him on top and i was encouraging him to go harder so that he could have a great finish as well. still all good so far! i continued to egg him on, telling him to step up his game and finish him. (no body slam moves required)
....

after a particularly enthusiastic thrust i suddenly got a stab of pain in my side, making me curl up in agony. he mistook this for intense pleasure (apparently my pain face is similar to my sexy face? not sure how to take that one!) and kept going for a couple more plunges before it finally became obvious to him as i burst into tears!

this lead into him panicking that he'd somehow broken me with his cock (he may be overestimating there) and me trying to figure out wtf had just happened and why i was crying. i'm guessing it something to do with the lovely stabbing cramps in my right hand side of my abdomen. possibly.
cue the naked running around as he grabs hot water bottle and glass of water while i curl up on the bed, now very lacking in sex appeal.

turns out that if you have pcos (polycystic ovary syndrome), 'enthusiastic exercise' can sometimes cause a ovarian cyst to get over excited and burst! 

worst part was, we were trying to fit in this fun time before his parents came over for dinner and now, 20 minutes before they arrive am now stuck in an ungainly position on the bed, totally starkers for all to see. 
i had to phone his mum to ask if she had any ibuprofen she could bring round for me as we had none in the house and then had to try and explain exactly why i needed them. luckily she had the sense to not ask any further questions when i said it can be triggered by certain types of exercise.

managed to get husband to help me pull some clothes on moments before they arrived, so saved some of my dignity at last.
he's now convinced his dick is cursed and is going to break me again.

"my mom wants to terminate her parental rights because i don't want to have an abortion. i'm 16 years old and live in pennsylvania.

the people at the clinic wouldn't do the abortion after i said my mom was forcing me. they told my mom it has to be my decision.

my mom said she's going to the courthouse to give up her parental rights. can she do this?

editing because some people are being really rude: i know what my options are. i know that she can kick me out when i turn 18. i know that i need a plan. i'm 16, not an idiot. i literally just want to know if she can terminate her parental rights immediately - there's a difference between having almost 2 years to plan for myself and my baby (which i'm not even sure i want to have yet i am just still thinking about my choices) and being kicked out onto the street immediately while pregnant.",2
"update my dog got into a fight with a smaller dog. owner asks for $1000 but won't show me vet bills. san francisco, ca.  **previous post;**

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update\_my\_dog\_got\_into\_a\_fight\_with\_a\_smaller\_dog/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update_my_dog_got_into_a_fight_with_a_smaller_dog/) 

&#x200b;

this happened couple of months ago and i forgot to update you guys. i guess, i just wanted to forget what happened.

here is the rundown of what i did and what the outcome was.

&#x200b;

i started talking to my neighbors who know my dog and i asked all of them to write what they though about my dog, while being aware of the incident and thankfully every one wrote very nice things about my dog and us as owners.

we went to the hearing and there were many people there for their own dog related incidents. 

after signing up a police officer asked me and my girlfriend to have a word. i will not say who he was but he was basically aware of the situation and he thought that we should not be there. he assured us that we should be fine even before the hearing started.

there were couple incidents we heard prior to ours and they all were related to dogs biting humans. we were the only ones there over a dog fighting another dog.

they called the person who sued me on stand and that's when the show started. he did really put a show for everyone.

he mentioned that his dog was dead for minutes but he resuscitate his dog. he mentioned that there were blood everywhere. he started crying and sobbing. he actually said that he tried to pull his dog from my dog's mouth but he though his dogs skin was coming off. i know it sounds all bad but don't worry because none of this happened and his dog was fine. my dog did really bite him but it was a bark bite where he penetrated skin only and let go. he had pictures with him and he thought those pictures would help his argument but it really did not. it looked like the dog just got scratched.

once he was done, it was our turn to speak. we kept it cool and explained what happened. we told the judge what we were doing to make sure this would never happen again. i also mentioned how he was asking for money and refusing to show me any bills. and that was it.. i called 3 weeks later and i was notified that our dog was not deemed danger to anyone.

&#x200b;

i know it's been a while and people who gave me opinions here most likely won't see it but i wanted to thank everyone.

&#x200b;

tl;dr my dog bit another dog over ball. it wasn't serious injury at all. owner demanded 1k$ + more in time. i agreed but wanted to see bills and owner freaked out and sued us and tried to get my dog put down. he failed and my lovely boy is next to me now.",2
"for not wanting to pay for a diamond ring?. so my girlfriend and i recently got engaged, and i figured it would be nicer to have her pick out her own ring rather then me guessing what she likes. 
now i already know my girlfriend loves shiny things, but now she is absolutely adamant that she wants a real diamond ring. personally i don't like the idea of shelling out so much money for a piece of jewelry with an artificial high price. so instead i offered to buy her one that was lab-grown, as it's way cheaper but also doesn't involve shady business practices and labor. 

money isn't an issue, it's really about the ethics for me. i do not like the idea of buying her something that potentially harmed someone in the making of it for our wedding. but she thinks i'm being stingy for not buying her a ""real"" diamond. we've already gotten in a few arguments over this so now i wanted to ask you guys if i should just suck it up or not.",3
"it's not bigoted to be uncomfortable when being exposed to gay stuff.. i'm a straight lad and i like women. i'm attracted to them i date them.

in this world, there are people who are gay. they can't change that. they are free to live their lives however i want. if i see two men kiss, will it make me uncomfortable? yes. am i going to do anything about it? no, because i believe people should be able to do what they want. 

should i be shamed for how i feel? no, because i'm never going to do anything to change what they do. they have their lives and i have mine. it's not my job to police what members of a free society do. i don't have to love it, i don't have to appreciate it, but i do have to accept what they are even if i'm not comfortable seeing it.",6
"does what my mother ate while she was pregnant with me effect what i like/don't like to eat?. when my mum was pregnant with me she ate a lot of oysters (and i mean a lot - like several dozens a day, most days). i personally find oysters to be gag-inducingly foul without exception, always have. 

whenever i've mentioned this to my friends they often seem to have an especially hated food that their mother craved a lot during pregnancy.

is there an actual correlation here or is it just a coincidence?

"picking up the wrong person from the airport and getting pulled over at gun point by the police.. i live near a smaller airport and i help out at the local turkish community center.  i'm white but i go to a free dinner they do every other thursday and it is amazing, so i chose to volunteer every once in a while.   set up, take down, help older people out, the usual volunteer at a center thing. i've met a ton of awesome people and they are a blast to hang out with.

so last week, i was tasked to pick up an older woman flying in from turkey as she was the guest of honor at a fundraiser they were having. i was told she knew little to no english and i wasn't the first choice to go get her, i was just the only one available seeing everyone else had bigger jobs to do. 

they give me a sign with her surname on it, her flight number, and a general description of what she looked like. whiteboard in hand and a little hesitant, i set off for the airport ready to get my cargo.

i pull up to the international gate and immediately an eastern european woman standing all alone. i get out with my sign that says 'demir' and she smiles with great joy, points at the sign, points at herself and without hesitation, loads her bags in the car and hops in. last name? check. eastern european? check. not much english? check. can't believe my luck!!

i pull out of the airport and immediately head in the direction of the turkish center with my passenger all buckled up ready for the 35 minute drive.  about 15 minutes into the ride, she pulls out her phone and begins to rustle around. she calls someone and frantically speaks in turkish. i'm thinking she left something on the plane or at home. i felt bad but i couldn't do anything about it at the time, i was driving in the freeway.

10 minutes later, i'm off the freeway and a cop passes. he immediately flips a bitch, lights me up and i pull over. at this point i'm freaking out and when i turn around, i see the lady has uber out and upon further inspection, i'm not the uber driver.....

the cop tells me to get out and i am taken down very fast, by a plethora of cops, handcuffed, and put in the back of a squad car with zero information. my head hurts from the slam against the ground and i'm fully aware of the kidnapping situation i'm in. 

after about 15 minutes of the lady screaming in turkish to the police and other cars arriving, an officer opens the door and asks me my story.  i ask him to use my phone to contact the turkish center and the lead woman comes down to explain what happened. 

little did i know 'demir' is one of the most common surnames in all of turkey. so when the lady(her first trip to america) see that i have her name, she figures i'm the uber driver ready to pick her up. she knows how to use google maps and saw we were headed in the opposite direction of her intended destination. my heart is still going 10,000 beats a minute while another car with a friend from the center and what could be the real 'demir' pulls up. 

after a discussion that i'm not a part of takes place, the cops get me out of the car, unhand-cuff me and everyone, including the kidnapped woman, seems to be laughing....except me. i am in disbelief as of to what just happened and i definitely sweated through my entire outfit. we get back to the turkish center and the story spread like wild fire. everyone comes up to me with a hug, a laugh, and a drink. i got drunk drunk. 

tl;dr by picking up the wrong woman and getting arrested for kid napping. first names count, people!!!

edit: detained, not arrested. also, talking with turks, they all have varying degrees of where the country resides. eastern is too white, middle is bad in america, so most of them just say they are from turkey.",4

"for telling the cashier to fuck off and subsequently demanding her to get her manager because she had a condescending attitude towards me buying condoms?. i'm really, really pissed off at this girl i just encountered and idk if i'm just being an immature teen or if i'm justified.  basically i went to the walmart down the street because i needed condoms. i'm 16 and have been told i have a baby face but i guess that's just how it is.

the condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing i guess because of theft or something idk but i asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn't doing anything if she could open it up. she made a comment ""aren't you a little young to be needing those young man"" which really caught me off guard and i sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and i just mumbled again that i needed them. 

she basically made a condescending exaggerated ""hmfph"" noise and said ""i outta really call your mama and tell her what you're doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don't need to be using these"" before moving towards the condoms. my mom and i go shopping here often so while i personally didn't know this lady, it's not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her

here's where idk if i'm ta because she was getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that i basically aggressive said ""it's none of your business for why i need these, fuck off and do your job"". she was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like ""excuse me?"" and i said ""you heard what i said"". 

she said i'm not going to be doing anything and i needed to watch my mouth and she's not going to get anything for anyone with that kind of attitude and that's when i got really mad because she was wasting my time and humiliating me in front of the entire store and so i said ""give me a manager if you don't want to do your fucking job then"" and she stammered before refusing, so i ended up asking another employee. 

long story short i ended up getting the condoms, but i'm still so mad and upset that she essentially humiliated me in front of the entire store and my heart's been racing the entire day. did i handle the situation badly? aita?",3
"i made a budgeting spreadsheet for people who never earned to budget.. hey yall, i usually post on r/povertyfinance  but i wanted to share this here too.


so- what is this budget spreadsheet? why is it different from other budgeting tools?

i grew up poor and with zero sense of what it means to save. on the contrary- when i first started making money i would spend it on things i considered tangible stuff because money felt fleeting. to this day i still do that. i would always try to use different budgeting tools- but the truth is that most of them are set up for people who know how to save. i didn't. i also have adhd and with my brain its very hard to focus too much on the future and i tend to impulse buy if i'm not careful. by making it so that i only have one number i need to focus on i can simplify the process and give myself one thing to focus on while allocating fund to what i need. 

this sheet is set up to be :

1. easy to use
2. focused on a daily budget as opposed to long term
3. a good place to start when you have never  been able to or had to save before

its made to focus on giving you a daily limit to your spending. instead of focusing on where to allocate your money it works on the principal that as long as you remember to not go over your daily spending limit, you will be saving money passively. it gives you a definite number to limit yourself to- allowing you to focus on allocating funds to what they are really needed for.  i know this is much more simple than other sheet- its not the most comlpex or thorough sheet out there, but it is simple. the focus on simplicity is deliberate. i want this to be seen as a place to start. this may not be the best long term budgeting tool (and honestly i would like feedback to make it a better long term tool) but it is a good beginning and introduction to budgeting. 


heres what the sheet looks like(https://imgur.com/a/jgqsfei)


you use it like this

* go in
* make a copy
* change the numbers
* decide what percentage of your income you want to be saving
* budget.

the sheet includes three charts:

* a bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* a pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* a daily pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than im allowed to- and if i so i can see where im borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

"by eating a girl out and getting sent to the emergency room.. so this actually happened about 3 weeks ago. 

rewind to a night of heavy drinking, rocking out, and sleeping with a coworker. she was exceptionally fine so i decided to end the foreplay with a little tongue action. everything feels clean, no offensive smell or taste. we move onto the main course and i notice a more than offensive smell, must've dug up something deep. so i finish her and end the night.

a day later and my throat is sore, but i think nothing of it as i was drinking and smoking heavily the night before. 

two days later, my left tonsil is black, green, and white, swollen more than 2x it's size and hurts like a mf. i go down to the local med express to have it looked at and after about 35 mins i see the doctor. with a look of concern on his face, he tells me i need to go to the er. 'the er?' i asked 'is it really that bad?' the doc asks me how long it's been hurting and i told him i had just noticed it today. he tells me it's very aggressive and spreading rapidly; it's beyond his treatment. so i head down to the er to get asked more questions and wait to see another doctor. he finally comes in, looks at it and tells me they're going to have to drain my tonsil with a syringe (which didn't feel the best, by the way).

a script of painkillers, steroids for the swelling, amoxicillin, a few tears later and i'm all better.

tl;dr eating a girl out while she has a bacterial infection might land you in the er for tonsilitis.

edit: 

fun fact: the hospital bill was $606 :)


so it seems a few of you believe my teeth are rotting out of my skull and my mouth is just a festoon of bacteria. well, here's my mouth(https://imgur.com/a/frizu)

"my girlfriend cries at night and it breaks my heart. should i tell her i know that?. throwaway account because i feel more comfortable this way.

so, my girlfriend (21) and i (24) have dated for a year before we moved together a few months ago. she likes to sleep by herself sometimes so she moves to the couch and sleeps there. ≈a month ago we were sleeping separately again and when i woke up in the middle of the night because apparently my organism wanted some water, i heard some sobbing from the room where my girlfriend was sleeping. at first my sleepy brain didn't actually recognise those sounds as crying, but after focusing on them for a few minutes it was obvious for me that she was crying. the next day she looked as if nothing happened, we slept togeher and i decided not to talk about it with her. it happened again next week, when i just couldn't sleep and heard her sobbing when she was on the couch.
i figured she cries every night spends on the couch and at this point i don't really know if i should tell her i know about it.
it's worth mentioning that she's depressed and she really doesn't like showing her negative feelings or vulnerabilities and i'm afraid that if i tell her she's going to feel embarrassed or ashamed and won't talk about it again. she sees a therapist as well but i don't think it helps. she's a great person and i really love her, but that thing is killing me and i don't know what to do to make her feel better.

"my old boss is hellbent on getting me fired from my new position. **cross post from r/relationships. they told me to come here for advice. it is a wall of text but i needed to make sure i had all the important information.**

hey everyone first off let me say, throw away because a lot of people know my main account. also, i apologize for the wall of text that is ahead.

forgot tl:dr

tl:dr; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

so 5 years ago i graduated college and was applying to pa programs. i unfortunately did not get in any programs that fall, so i decided to move to a big city on the west coast. i applied to more schools out west and didn't get in. i then decided my best bet was to get more patient care hours so i got a job in a hospital, it wasn't ideal because my degree unfortunately is meaningless without grad school.

the job i get was entry level but it paid well and i was able to start paying back student loans and learn about inner workings of hospitals and see different departments. i loved my job because i was able to interact with patients, nurses, doctors pretty much all hospital staff.

i was hired on the midnight shift and during my first year i asserted myself as a leader and someone you could depend on. i worked almost 3200 hours my first year as my department was always short staffed so overtime was easy to come by.

after my first year there i still wasn't accepted into any grad school programs. but a leadership position on afternoons opened up and i applied for it and was interviewed by a panel of managers, my manager and several others.

i and 6 others out of 24 were brought back for a second interview, this one didn't involve my manager. i was told by the panel the only reason i wasn't outright given the job is because my manager didn't believe i would do a good job and she seriously doubted my leadership skills.

i agreed that i wasn't the most assertive person, but i would do my best to lead by action and speak up when i needed to. the panel informed me that, my job wasn't to force others to work harder, that was my managers job to make sure everyone was pulling their weight.

after a few weeks i got a call and was told i got the promotion i to the lead position. a few people who had been there longer than me gave me trouble the first few weeks because, ""we have seniority"" i told my manager and she said she would handle it.

we had what i thought was a good relationship, but it quickly became apparent she would have rather had someone else in my position, someone who would follow her direction without question even if it compromised patient care or privacy.

about 6 months after i took my current position we had several employees switch departments or quit. i was working 7 days a week 12 hour shifts until they hired enough new people to fill our voids. this took around 4 months. at that time i was accepted into a local pa program and would start the following spring.

i continued working when school started but much less than what i was before because of school. during this time my relationship with my manager deteriorated even further and she made it clear she wanted me gone. the only thing was, her boss, the director of nursing ranted and raved about what a wonderful job i was doing and even though we were at 3/4 staff i was still able to manage all the work.

i finally graduated from my program 2 1/2 years after i started. at that point i needed a break from all work as i was work in 40 hours a week on top of 36 hours of interning/clinical work as well as studying. i requested all of my pto to be used to go back home as i hadn't left to see my family in over 5 years. my pto was approved by hr and i took off, i had 2 full months off.

during my time off i got a call from the emergency department, they really wanted me to come in and be a trauma pa, i was also called by our stroke unit where i did a vast majority of my internship and they were interested in me coming to them to work. i was ecstatic because both the emergency department and stroke unit were places i wanted to work. i talked it over with my family and decided to work for the emergency department.

i called my boss and told her that i was putting in my 2 weeks and since i had a month and a half left on my vacation i figured i would be fine starting in the ed when i returned. i told her i was offered a full time pa position and she seemed really excited for me. i notified the ed that i would be graciously accepting their offer, and that i could start as soon as i got back.

my friend who works in the department told me my boss was livid i was quitting but i didn't think much of it. i said it was too bad and people leave all the time when it is their turn to move on.

i left it at that, i was very ready to get back to the hospital and begin working. however, when i returned, i ram into a bunch of issues, firstly, hr did transfer me to the ed as a clinical staff member but didn't terminate my previous job title. my first day, my badge stopped working i couldn't use it to get into my work area, locker room, the building. i went into hr and they said my previous manager said i wasn't part of the company anymore and to terminate my badge access.

odd but i told them i was now a pa in the ed and showed them my new credentials. they reluctantly allowed me access to my work areas.

the next week, i am pulled aside by my new boss. he asks me how everything is going and if i can swing by his office after my shift. i tell him yeah thinking it's going to be a check up on how the new job is going.

my shift ends and i go to my new bosses office. he asks me why he is hearing so many negative things about me. i ask him what he means and he tells me i have had 3 formal complaints filed against me. i ask him if i can see them and he pulls them up on his computer. the first one is about unprofesionalim in the workplace. i ask him who filed it and he said it would be better if he kept it anonymous because the second complaint was about workplace violence. the third complaint was a hippa violation claim.

i was taken aback because the first two complaints came from 2017, when i was in my original department. the third complaint was when i went to clean out my previous locker and i was verbatim, ""throwaway was in a secure loaction where he sought out potential information about patients."" it was the break room that doubled as out locker room, i was only there for 5 minutes to clean out my locker.

i went to hr because all of these are serious allegations and they told me all 3 complaints were made by my former manager. i was upset that all this was happening and there is basically nothing i can do. hr conducted a formal investigation on me and found nothing to be out of place.

a few weeks later my new boss had a sit down with my previous manager where she told him, ""she will stop at nothing until i am fired."" and, ""he is the most lazy and unprofessional worker in this entire establishment.""

i went to hr to file a complaint about her and potential harassment. hr told me they are unable to file my complaint because i am under review for corrective action and a manager would never do anything like that so i should just drop it while i am ahead.

about a week later i passed my old manager and she called out me me and said, ""wow, i'm surprised you're still here, i wouldn't want a provider taking care of me with your reputation"" in a hallway in front of patients, nurses, doctors and visitors.

i tried to schedule a meeting with her to talk but she said there was ""nothing to talk about"" and my actions are ""reprehensible"" and soon enough i would be ""where i belong, out the doors""

i heard from my boss that she has been scheduling meetings with higher ups about me and my boss doesn't know if it is going to work if this ""drama"" continues.

i don't know what i should do because, i have done nothing but display the up most respect for her, she is just hellbent on ruining my career at the facility and any other place i try and move to. is there any action i should be taking right now? i feel like i should retain a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter, because her actions and false claims could be damaging my future.

any advice would be greatly appreciated.

tl:dr; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

edit: for u/commonwerewolf

firstly, my manager was well aware 2 1/2 years before i left that as soon as i was done with school i would be moving on fairly quickly. she was very supportive at that time and understood because there are a lot of college kids who work in the department while they are in school.

my last full year in school we (my manager, myself, the other afternoon leader, the 2 night time shift leaders and the weekend leaders) sat down to choose another lead. one of the night time people wanted my position which my manager agreed to. we also took applications from department workers to fill the now open night time lead position and filled it a full year before i would be done with school.

my 2 months were approved by hr and then by my manager, we have to have double approval. she said, this was wonderful because she could rotate her new crew in as i had been reeling back my duties. the new night time leader was originally on my shift and he had gradually been picking up my work per my managers request to train in the leadership role, which he's excelled at.

my manager knew i hadn't been home in almost 5 years and that i really needed a break because in those 5 years i had a full week off for sickness, and a handful of random days here and there. most of the time i was at work, didn't have a social life, that's ok i was a grad student didn't really need one. i missed out on a lot of things because i was willing to put in 60+ hours a week.

when i went on my vacation i was not expecting to get a new position but my manager was aware that my application was out and that i could get a call that i could not turn down.

also, when i did put in my 30 day notice, i did call and i talked with her. i told her i was more than willing to start my 30 days when i returned but was told we already have the replacements inline and that they are working out well so it wasn't necessary to delay my transfer.

i have done everything professionally and by the books. i always conducted myself in the most professional manner i could while improving patient care. we had replacements picked out a whole year before i left. the two who took over are both in school and will be there for an extended period of time because the department works incredibly well with school schedules, that is why i stayed so long.

and yes i said that to my friend because i genuinely didn't care at that point because i had multiple okays from my manager to transfer. so i wasn't so beat up about her being upset after i had the go ahead to leave.

i would love you to respond again because i do agree with what you have to say and any insight is perfectly valid and wanted!",2
"my (25f) best friend (25f) slept with an old crush at her bachelorette party and acts like nothing happened. i'm torn between doing ""the right thing"" which would likely ruin a 20 year friendship or closing my eyes and looking the other way. hear me out. 

let's call her jane. jane and i have been friends and neighbors since we were 5. we went to college together and had a typical ""wild streak"" during those years, filled with lots of debauchery. we never did any drugs, though. that was our hard line in the sand. after graduating, we both got well paying jobs and essentially got our lives together. i am not married and still happily single, but jane is engaged to be married to a great guy, let's call him robert. our families love him and over time, he also became my good friend. they're getting married in a beautiful destination wedding in september. i couldn't be more excited for them and jane has been planning this event for close to a year. 

this weekend we had her bachelorette party which consisted of going to our country club with 8 other girl friends. the plan was to just swim, tan, bbq, play volleyball, watch movies, drink cocktails, and reminisce. on saturday morning, jane comes to breakfast and tells us that she has a surprise for us. okay, shouldn't be the other way around? lol. anyway, around noon, 6 dudes in swimming attire roll in. we were like, ""um, isn't this supposed to be a girls weekend?"" to which jane replied, ""yeah but i figured you girls need some company"". we all laughed, however none of us ever even hinted at needing men. turns out, this was just her cover and ruse to get guys in without making it obvious it was for her. we spent the day by the pool, playing volleyball and drinking. now, most of the girls there were single so we got a little touchy feely with the guys. to our surprise, at some point towards the evening, i see jane making out with a dude in the pool. i just brushed it off and went about my business. another friend karen walked up to me asking why is name of guy here. initially i didn't know who she was referring to but then it clicked. i knew that dude looked familiar but couldn't put my finger on where from. turns out, he was jane's huge crush in college. classic football star, philanderer, handsome and charming guy. we both realized that the whole reason why she had invited these guys over was that she could casually spend time with her old crush. 

at that point i figured the party was taking a turn we weren't comfortable with so i walked up to jane, pulled her to the side and essentially reminded her that she's getting married next month. she laughed me off, asking me to not ruin her party. i wasn't about to argue with her so i dropped it. they made out the whole night, in front of everyone else. jane was sitting on his lap, kissing, petting, doing all sorts of inappropriate things. another girl even tried to say that our party days should be behind us, we're grown ups now, not teenagers fucking in bushes. nope, nothing could swing jane. around 2am, everyone went to the rooms. as expected, jane and that guy spent the night in the same bedroom and i assume they were not playing board games. this morning, we all had breakfast, then the guys left, we checked out, and came back home. i talked to jane earlier and she is back into the full wedding prep mode, talking about flowers and menus. 

me and the girls discussed about whether we should have a serious talk with jane. we've all seen other friends of ours getting married to the wrong people, being miserable, and getting divorced before they hit their 30s. i don't want this to happen to her. we're pretty much 50/50 on whether we should just forget what happened and never mention it again or have the talk with her. we all saw that she and that guy had some weird chemistry and seemed very comfortable with each other. i'm not sure if that was their first time together since college. i'm thinking that she might still have a thing for that dude but i am not sure how to bring it up with her without sounding harsh. what do we do?

tl;dr: my soon-to-be-married best friend slept with a friend from college and acts like nothing happened",7

"no one should feel bad for catching a ball at a baseball game and not giving it to a nearby child.. i'm even okay with wrestling it away so long as no one is hurt. (**edit: this refers to a simultaneous possession/catch scenario where the kid and i both have our hands on the ball at the same time. i am not okay with an adult running over to a kid who already caught it and snatching it away. but if the kid competes with me to catch it, i'm winning that competition and not feeling the least bit bad about it.**)imagine if you're a baseball fan who's been going to games their whole life and you don't get a chance to catch a ball until you're like 34 or something. you catch one and someone's little kid is nearby and they're either crying or giving you that oliver twist ""may i have some more?"" look.

if you want to give the kid the ball, great. if you don't and you keep it, also great. i mean, think of who has more invested, here. the adult likely bought their own ticket, has been a loyal fan of mlb for much longer, understands and appreciates the game at a higher level than the child, will probably take better care of the ball.

but of course the cameras will be on you and everyone will be ready to hate you if you don't give the kid the ball. as a person who wants kids, fuck dem kids. it'll be a good lesson in how unfair life is. so let's weigh pros and cons.

if you give the ball away, people will say you're a swell person online, but you'll be upset because you don't have the ball. 

if you keep the ball, people will shit on you online and likely in the stadium, but then they'll forget and you still have the ball. kid will forget by next week. 

the winning option is clear. i'm not even a huge baseball fan but if i should so happen to be at a cardinal's game one day and i catch a ball, i am keeping it and ignoring every kid near me unless it's my own kid.

**edit2: since people keep asking why an adult would want to keep the ball, a blues player gave me a hockey puck a little while back. it sits on my mantle and is a great conversation piece. the baseball would do the same thing. but also, if i wanted to give the ball to my dog as a toy, that's my prerogative. the happiness of my husky means more to me than the happiness of some random kid. i also have friends who are huge baseball fans with kids who play. one kid i know personally and play chess with is 14 and a very good player and dreams to make it to the mlb. i can also see myself giving it to him. the point is, though, that what i do with it could be anything i want. it's mine.**

"update my landlord thinks i have a dog named steve. sorry - forgot to link my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9spqbh/ny_im_being_evicted_for_violating_my_apartments

so - first off i wasn't totally honest about my relationship with my landlord. this was probably pretty obvious the more i commented but we're actually really close friends. like i spend holidays with his family. so yeah, that's how i knew he wasn't just fucking me over to get more money. 


anyway, i met with a lawyer. i like him. he basically said the same thing as everyone here - nyc is really tenant friendly, and if this makes it to court (unlikely, you'll see why) it won't be hard to fight. i don't think i'd want to fight though. i probably have nothing to worry about but i would just peacefully move if it does happen. 


the rest of this update isn't very legal. sorry if that's against the rules. 


so - i ended up calling 311 instead of adult protective services since google gave me a few different numbers. i must have described the situation really badly because they transferred me to animal care and control twice and then i was distracted by a fire at work (that's not jargon - we were evacuated because of a fire on another floor. the story is they were making s'mores in a conference room). 


this wasn't a call i wanted to make surrounded by all of my coworkers while we stood around outside so i texted his sister instead and we made plans to talk later. long story short, she'd gotten some weird messages from him lately (like him congratulating her on a promotion then getting angry when she had no idea what he was talking about). once she heard about steve and the eviction, she made plans to fly out to us the next day. 


this is getting long (sorry), so jumping a bit - she told him some story and convinced him to fly back to ca with her. before he left he apologized for blowing up at me and said that we could talk about the dog when he got back and try to work it out but that it was shitty that i did it behind his back especially when it was against the lease and he couldn't rent to someone he couldn't trust. 


i asked his sister about the eviction (just in case) and she said of course i wasn't evicted and to just hold down the fort. 


anyway - so he's at a place near his family being treated now. i don't know what for and i don't really care as long as he's getting better. that's his business and he'll tell me if he wants to. i just want him to be okay and it looks like he will be. 


(i do know it's nothing environmental because i've had the whole place tested for everything. also i've been staying there and i'm still fine.) 


his family is awesome and reaching out to me almost daily. i haven't been able to talk to him since he left, but hopefully soon. i'm also going there for thanksgiving so i'll most likely even get to see him. 


and when he's back we can maybe start looking for our new dog steve.

"minecraft is unironically one of the best games ever made and its status as an ironic meme is undeserved.. there are so many factors that make it great, but its fan base made it lose its reputation. the amount of control given to the player is insane and the building is extremely polished and expansive. mojang has kept adding content to make the game less repetitive. there is a lot of depth to the redstone mechanic. the soundtrack is amazing, too. it's really the perfect game if you have a couple of hours and a few friends. you don't even have to go in depth. you can do anything you want, even if that means building stupid garbage for laughs.",6
"by taking a bath with my girlfriend. obligatory this happened two months ago

my girlfriend and i were sick and congested.  we were sitting on the couch and she said she was going to take a bath and put in eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil.  

she then asked me if i wanted to join.  sure, laying in a hot bath sounded really nice.  she went downstairs to grab our towels and i started the bath.  as i put the oils in, i yelled asking how much i should put in.  i got the answer of only a little bit. 

apparently our definitions of a little bit are different.  i don't know if you know how strong peppermint oil is, but i should be able to paint a picture.

as we climbed in the hot bath, i realized that my asshole was starting to feel like an ice cube was getting shoved up it.  

in my congested, mentally drained from illness mind, i said ""hey babe, hot water rises right?""

right away she looked back at me and screamed ""how much fucking peppermint oil did you put in?!""

i said i turned it upside down and maybe like 10 drops got out.  

so we jumped out, body covered in water with peppermint.  it burned like icy hot.  my balls were on fire.  my girlfriend starts crying from the pain, and is screaming.  i'm in the fetal position trying to wipe water off my balls. 

i then get the idea of jumping in the shower and seeing if getting the peppermint off of me was possible.  nope.  makes it much worse.

fast forward ten minutes, we are curled up on the couch both covered in multiple blankets trying to get warm.   it wears off on my girlfriend and she says she just feels numb, but it doesn't hurt anymore.  takes me an extra 15 minutes for it to stop hurting.  

the heat from the blankets warmed me, but i felt like i had ice under my skin.  

half an hour later, it went away.

and that's why i'm not allowed to draw our baths anymore.

tl;dr: girlfriend and i are sick.  decide to take bath. i put enough peppermint oil in bath.  my girlfriend and i get it seeping into our pores. has the effect of icy hot.  balls and asshole are in pain.  girlfriend cries, we have to wait out the pain.  

edit:  holy shit, this is in the top ten all time tifu's.  i'm honored and ashamed.  

things that i've learned since i posted this last night

1. a lot about essential oils

2. my girlfriend loves how everyone is reacting to this.

3. too many people have had similar experiences.  

edit #2: thank you whoever game me gold!  i love you.  

edit #3:  my girlfriend is sick and i've had a long day.  all of these comments have us laughing and in a good mood, thank you.  we both needed this.

i was helping my dad and stepmom clean up for a garage sale. i was in the attack and was going through a bunch of old boxes that hadn't been touched in years. i was looking through one box and there were some photos of me with aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members on my dads side. i had never seen these pictures so i looked through them all. after a few photos, they were just photos of me. usually alone on a bed. then there were photos of me naked. and i was crying. i dont really want to go into detail of the rest of the photos i saw.

"by leaving a suicide note before running outside. okay so the obligatory this happened a few months back.

a little backstory, i have dealt with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, have a few (obviously) unsuccessful attempts. good news; i'm better now and i laugh about it. i was better back then too.

also worth mentioning i'm into writing short stories and currently a novel.

so back to the fuck-up, a short story i was writing back then started off with a 15 year old girl finding a suicide letter dated 10 years into the future, and is in her own handwriting. i bet you can see where this is going.. so i start drafting the letter and before i finish it with the dating and stuff i get a call from my friend saying she is around and wants to talk, so i get out saying very little to my mom.

after leaving in a hurry and staying outside for a few hours my mom gets worried and calls me. *shocker* i left my phone at home. (it's really not a rare thing for me to do, it's rare i take it with me unless i'm going to school or a date or something) she goes into my room and sees ""my"" suicide note.

she gets scared and calls my dad. soon after, my family is driving around looking for me. i walk back home and to my surprise there is police cars and my parents are crying. after a quick explaining and a few hours of scolding everything was fine but i felt terrible for putting my parents through that fear again.

remorse: not all days, but most my teeth hurt and i have no way to stop the pain. i live in the usa and cannot afford insurance to get it fixed. if i had the money to get them all pulled and replaced i would, but the dental place told me it would cost over $7,000.

my life has been going well for the most part lately and i feel horrible for even thinking of wanting to die to escape the pain. i have 2 kids that need me and a family that loves me, but love doesn't buy new teeth.

i did it to myself back in highschool by throwing up after each meal. i don't smile often and when i actually do i have to cover my mouth because i don't want others to be grossed out by my teeth. most of the time i just grin to the right side. my kids don't like me going to their school, meeting their friends and teachers because they are embarrassed of my mouth. i try not to show it, but that hurts more than the physical pain i endure from the infection that is spreading.

"(update) my(23f) sister(25f) and friends(20s) talked about how i'm not good enough for my bf(25m). they don't know i heard..

hey everyone, first of all, i'd like to thank everyone for the messages and comments on my last post, it truly helped me get off the bed and face the day.

i showed my bf the last post bc i just didn't know how i could say it. he was very sad and disappointed but being asexual he has had his fair number of assholes, but he mostly felt angry for me and agreed with the majority of advices that i should confront her. we decided a letter would be the best choice since i actually write a lot of letters and it's not direct confrontation.

i like writing letters for moments(like, letters for when the person is sad, happy, angry, scared, ect) so i do have some techinique but this was, with no doubt, the hardest things i ever wrote. i decided to go for the simple and blunt. told her i heard what they said about me and while i was willing to work on our relationship, i needed distance from her and this whole situation.

i talked with my landlord(lady?) and she was super sweet and had no problem breaking the lease, i offered to find someone to take up my place but apparently she has someone that could use the room so that's cool

i intended to pack and leave the letter on her bed but she came home early and caught me. i basically said fuck it to myself and told her i heard them saying i wasn't good enough and calling me names.

first she tried to deny, which i wasn't having it, then she tried to justify and say i was overreacting but i just stared at her. then she finally started to apologize and cry. at that moment i actually thought we might be able to save the relationship but then she started making herself the victim. the main points were

1- i just can't understand how hard it is to be pretty(not even kidding)

2- i don't understand how she feels bc i'm used at not being the best

3-it's not fair i get a gorgeous bf, who is completely out of my league while she's single

4-she feels embarassed when we go out together and she has to tell people that my bf is actually mine, not hers

5-she knows asexuality doesn't exist and we're doing this just for attention.

i just kinda froze, i wish i had said something but i couldn't open my mouth. she then said she was going out to ""recover from our traumatic conversation"" and left. 

i just packed the rest of my things and left the letters on her bed. 

i'm currently at my bf's place but i'm looking for a free room that is not super far from my job.

i also wrote and sent letters to my ""friends"" a and then blocked their social media/contacts. i'm certain they'll find a way to approach me as we work close but i can't give a fuck.

besides all of that, last friday i had dinner with my parents, i gave them an edited version of what happened(bc i don't wanna talk about my sex life) and that i broke the lease/blocked my friends. they said i shouldn't be angry bc it was true and that the first time they met my bf they thought i was playing a prank. my dad then started saying i was veing selfish by breaking the lease and, i shit you not, betraying my sister trust and that you don't do this with family.

so yeah, i've been ignoring them since this happened, as well as my sister.

overall, i'm fine, i actually feel more tired than angry or sad


tl;dr: talked with my bf, it went well. talked with my sister, didn't go well. moved out. talked with my parents, they said i'm selfish

"by nearly twisting my dick off with a fleshlight duct taped to an industrial fan.. alright so this was a few weeks ago. i was going to post about it then but decided to see how things healed since i knew there would probably be questions. this is long but there was a lot too it sorry.

this began as many other bad ideas do, i had smoked some herb and was horny. my roommate was out of town for the day and i had the place to myself, figured i would take advantage of the rare opportunity and try to enjoy something more than just a speed fap. i pulled out the fleshlight that  i rarely use and started to get to work. i was at my computer but could not really get into it. trying to operate the mouse and the fleshlight while lubed up was too cumbersome and it just felt like jacking off with more steps involved(the main reason i don't really use it). i pulled up some porn on my phone and tried to find a way to stuff the fleshlight between my mattress, and then in a shoe for a hands free experience but still was having trouble so gave up.  

leaning over the bed my box fan was blowing on my bare ass so i went over too shut it off and that's when i got the idea. i took the front grill off and duct tape the back of the fleshlight too the center of the fan. overwhelmed with anticipation of my new discovery i lubed up my boner, inserted it and turn on the fan. it felt extremely good but was not quite working, the fan was too weak and the friction was slowing it down nearly to a stop, i knew i was onto something and needed a bigger fan. being walking distance from a walmart i headed over.  

they had a couple to choose from i almost went with the biggest $140 drum fan since bigger seemed better(really glad i didn't) but instead opted for the $60 industrial floor fan that seemed like it would be more than good enough for the job at hand. i also happened to pick up one of those stupid hands free phone supports that go around your neck so i could have the ultimate experience. at this point i couldn't wait and basically power walked home with this giant box. i opened it up, took off the front grill and rigged it up the same way. phone around my neck, looking like an idiot, i lubed up and inserted my dong.

what came next was pure heaven, this was legit one of the best things i have ever felt. the fleshlight was slightly off center so it almost made it vibrate while spinning. the vibration mixed with the spinning, the nubs in the fleshlight and manual thrusting in and out was insane. i tried the second speed but that was too much to handle. just as i was really getting into it my phone began to ring, my sister was calling which she doesn't normally do unless it's important. i stopped the fan while still inserted and talked with her on the phone for around 5 minutes. after we finished the call i turned my video and then the fan back on.

this was my big mistake, at this point my meat was nearly flaccid but still stretched out a bit in the fleshlight. in order to secure it to the fan the bottom of the flesh light had to be completely tightened. the bottom usually has a release valve so you can control how much suction there is on the inside, completely tightened is maximum suction. before i could even comprehend what was happening i felt some tightening and then a searing pain in my penis. my brain took me a second to process before i pulled my dick out and i literally saw it unwind in front of me. i'm uncertain how many times, was at least a couple and the sight of this along with the pain in my wiener caused me to black out. when i came too i shut off the fan which was still spinning and my shlong was feeling red hot. panicking i just pranced around the gripping it. other than being really red and shriveled in it looked fairly normal no rips that i could see. being high and extremely embarrassed i grabbed some frozen vegetables, placed them on my rod and decided to wait it out a bit.  

the waiting was horrible but couple hours in everything seemed to be getting a bit better until i had too pee which just felt like lava dribbling from my shaft. at this point i was feeling more sober and drove myself too the urgent care where i was seen by a doctor and then directed to a urologist. i came clean since i wanted a proper diagnosis and you can imagine the reaction. almost seemed like he was more disappointed in me with every question i answered. i was given a cavernosography where they inject die into your cock before an x-ray to see if the vessels are damaged and an mri. he said that  i may suffer some permanent damage from the penile torsion i was very scared waiting for the results.

that is the point i was originally going to write this but this is the update after 3 weeks. everything came back good, the inflammation was likely causing the pain inside while urinating, the pain on the outside was from a friction burn, basically after me dick twisted as much as it could the fleshlight was still moving around it for a few rotations and gave me a burn across my whole dick. that has since cleared up and everything is back around 80%. now that i'm getting boners again i'm honestly half temped to try again since it felt so good. just remember if you try this to stay extremely hard and well lubricated the whole time.

tl;dr was high and horny got the idea to duct tape a fleshlight to an industrial fan. things went wrong when i turned it on with a flaccid penis. my dick twisted multiple times before i passed out. after seeing a urologist no permanent damage was incurred besides some inflammation and a friction burn on my entire shaft. everything is feeling good again and may give it another go in the future.",4

"for objecting to ""female employee only"" parking spaces at my workplace?. so theres not too much to say, i guess i'm more curious in others opinions on this.  i am an approx 22.5 year old man, i recently snagged a really really good job.  i work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  it's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). i would also like to preface the following with saying that i work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. 

about a week ago i was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and i was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  as my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, i thought to myself ""woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?"" so i started reading it and i was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  basically, it read as follows ""female employee parking space only!"" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  

now, let me clarify i am not ""irate"" or ""fuming"" about it, but i dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  i even asked my fiance when i got home, just to get a female insight on it.  she said she thought it was stupid.  i guess i'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.  just my two cents on it though.

"my sister got kicked out of her gym, they refuse to give her a refund for it after they renewed it themselves. i will be using a throwaway for this due to privacy concerns.

my sister is overweight, weighing in at nearly 400 pounds. it is a very embarrassing thing for her, and it's always been a struggle to help her shed weight. her endo has diagnosed her with severe thyroid problems along with hormonal imbalances that have been difficult to treat even with various medications. so a part of her current weight loss regiment is to exercise at a gym as recommended by her gp and her endocrinologist. she has enrolled at (x) gym a few weeks ago.

right away, she has claimed that she has had run-ins with a group of catty women. my sister has depression and anxiety, formed partly due to intense bullying from classmates and co-workers as well as abuse from our parents. so she tends to get overly nervous and makes mistakes. so my sister began to misuse the equipment accidentally, and the women tear into her in a very mean way. my sister apologizes but these women report her to the gym who reprimand my sister.

so for many days, my sister was being belittled and insulted by this group. they continued to report her and make her feel bad. still she tried to ignore it because her health depended on this. one day, my sister got filmed struggling with the equipment and she slipped on the mat, falling on her butt. this was posted online and got passed around the gym and outside of it. she found out way later, and this hurt her. when she reported this to the gym, the manager said he would speak to the women. days later, she asked the manager if he spoke to them, and he asked who my sister was (basically he forgot).

my sister wrote a complaint to the higher ups at the gym. she received a response stating that there was nothing they could do about her being filmed, as it was a public space. three days after this, she received a notice stating her membership at the gym was cancelled. despite this, she was charged the renewal fee. i stepped in and called them, demanding a refund on my sister's behalf. the gym told me that it was her responsibility to cancel the membership herself, i told them that *they* were the ones who cancelled on her. basically the conversation went in circles.

now what can i do? i have a feeling that there's not much i can do legally but i am hoping something can be done. my sister does not want to go to the media because she feels embarrassed and is afraid of being in front of a camera, also of the video online gaining more visibility. can i take them to court? if so, for what charges? can i legally compel them to give my sister the refund?",2

"sallie mae has raised my interest rate to a ludicrous rate and are not informing me why and are straight up ignoring my questions. i need advice on how to battle this or some good loan consolidation options.. i'll keep this short and sweet (or bitter rather).

as the title states, sallie mae recently raised my interest rate to 10.75%, my loan amount is 28k. i have called them multiple times and have tried to get it lowered to no avail.

what are my options? currently i'm paying $250 in interest alone every month and my total monthly payment is around $360. i've been paying around $500 each month to try and chip away at it faster but i realize that it would be a lot faster if i also reconsolidated this loan and also paid 500 every month.

what are some good loan reconsolidating options? i've tried my bank but they don't offer student loan reconsolidating options anymore. i've gone to my parents since they have excellent credit and asked them if they could reconsolidate it for me by taking a personal loan (they could probably get a rate of 3-4% with their credit) and i would just pay them every month instead of sallie mae but they shut that idea down and are not willing to help.

what can i do? any help/criticism would be greatly appreciated and i can provide some additional info if needed.

edit: to further clarify, i know i signed up for variable rate but was told as long as i make the monthly payments on time they wouldn't raise the rate on me (if that's wrong i understand, that's just what i had been told)

for the past 1.5 years i have been making the minimum plus an extra 150-200 dollars, but my interest rate has increased by 3.5 points.

edit 2 from what i've learned  before i go to sleep:

1. always choose fixed rate over variable
2. shop around for rates instead of sticking to one financial institution
3. interest rates can fluctuate for various external reasons (hence always choosing fixed rate)
4. the people of reddit are very helpful!

my husband and i have a son. he's just turned five. the early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! during this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. there were quite some bad days, but my husband and i got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. so a few days ago, i pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. when we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. it seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. i sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.then my son and i leave for the movie.


today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that i didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. i'm kind of shocked that i'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. i feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

wow. 
to start, i would just like to say how grateful i am to everyone who commented. 
the advice i received was so kind, understanding and helpful. i was so overcome with gratitude. i didn't respond to many because i didn't know how to properly express how incredible it was that strangers would take time to be so kind to me. 

i'm really sorry for the late update. i wanted to take my time and read every comment. i wanted to let every comment really stick to my brain. 
i took time to let everyone's words stew in my mind. i did a lot of self reflection. 
i realised a lot of things. 

i broke up with him. 
it was so so hard, and i am sad, but i understand that it was definitely for the best. i was so unhappy. 
he was very against the idea of breaking up but i just told him i'd decided and there was nothing else to say on it. 

there was so much i left out of my post. my gut told me that what he did to me was wrong. after reading everyone's comments i think i was very right. 
he wasn't very kind to me, honestly. he would get angry when i would get anxious and he would call me a ""cunt"" or a ""stupid bitch"" when we would fight over stupid things. he would have sex with me when i was asleep. he would call me pathetic. 

i mistook his affection for being a good partner. i mistook him kissing me and calling me baby for being kind. 
these are kind actions, yes, but they don't hold the same weight when he's disrespecting my boundaries in bed and disrespecting my feelings in life. 

i think it's time i cared for me.  i was desperately trying to make him like me, dulling down every part of me that is interesting so i'm a ""cute"" and ""domestic"" partner. ignoring my feelings and needs so he would be comfortable. this was hurting me so much. 
i didn't even realise it until other people pointed out that my ""perfect"" boyfriend was acting kind of shitty. 

it was a bit of an epiphany. i feel better than i have for so long. i feel happy and i feel hopeful. i want to love myself. he really skewed how i felt about my sexuality and myself. i really want to care for myself. i want to fix the ways i was hurt and i want to take time to be single and heal before i find a super kind, respectful partner in the future (or don't!! thank you to everyone who made me realise i don't even need a partner to be happy and successful!). i've spent time with my friends. apologised for the way i had distanced myself from them during my relationship. one of my friends and i have booked an overseas trip for after graduation. i'm so excited for it. 

i'm so excited to discover who i am without him. i'm looking forward to the future. i've never felt more hopeful. 

a lot of people said i was raped. this is a very hard thing for me to come to terms with. i understand why people said it. some of the acts felt very assaulting, and if it was anyone else aside from me telling me that their lover had done to them what mine had done to me, i would also say it was sexual assault. 

to be completely honest, i am struggling with the idea that it classifies as rape - i feel a bit like a fraud. someone said to call my situation rape was completely delegitimising actual rape victims. while so many kind people stood up for me against this person, what they said stuck and i feel a bit worried. i have accepted that it was sexual assault. i'm still struggling with the word rape. 

i asked my mum to book me in for therapy again. she asked if i was alright and i left it kind of vague. i just said that i was stressed about school - i still feel a bit nervous about telling the people in my life about why i ended the relationship and what was happening. i hope i can get over that. i had a therapist i saw after my cancer and i have an appointment for next week. 

i'm going to try really hard to make my life and my world about me :)

thank you again to everyone. thank you so so much. i would've stayed with him if it wasn't for the (sometimes harsh, mostly kind, always eye opening) advice i received from 1.3k people!! wow! that's so many people. 

i probably would have married him. i never would have left him if it hadn't been for the slap in the face the response to my post caused. thank you. from the bottom of my heart. 

i'm so happy. it's a bittersweet kind of happy. he was my best friend, my person, i loved him and i loved his family. i'm sad to leave him and to make the call. but my heart and brain are more important than that. 
i feel relief. i don't feel like i have to always look gorgeous. i feel like i can do whatever the heck i want, and it's so wonderful. 

i'm free :) 

tldr: i broke up with him! i'm happy!",7

"for changing my mind midway through buying a stranger coffee?. i stopped by a local coffee place after work today. there was a woman behind me in line with a toddler, the kid was sweet and saying ""hello"" to everyone in line and genuinely brightened my day. 

while i was standing near the cash register waiting for my order, the woman stepped up and ordered a $4 coffee. i kindly offered to pay and she seemed so grateful and even thanked me twice. right after, she turned back to the cashier and said, ""in that case, you can add two extra shots and a blueberry muffin.""

i was so taken aback, i immediately told the cashier that i changed my mind and she could pay for her own order. i walked over, picked up my drink and left without another word. 

for reneging on my offer? 

edit: i want to thank everyone so much for responding. the only thing i'd like to clarify is that i felt bad about it afterwards. she could have intended to pay for the add-ons, it could have been a joke, etc. i didn't communicate with her very well because i fell into a trap of assuming the worst. if she looked at me expectantly to pay, i would clearly not be an asshole. it was more my quick response of which i was unsure.

"i (28m) is about to propose to my gf (28f) of 7 years, but then i discovered something. need advice.. we've been together for 7 years, and we've been really really happy together. she's sweet, loving, and caring.. she's already been close to my family, and me to hers. we are really connected to each other, same passion, same likes and dislikes, we frequently travel together and all. we rarely fight, and when we do, we resolve issues quickly.. it's like a perfect relationship. we've been steady, we're genuinely happy in love.

just when i was already contemplating on proposing to her, i felt like she's gone cold for the past month. just this valentines, we were on top of the world surprising one another with gifts and sweet nothings. but the following weeks felt different.

her ""i love yous"" weren't as enthusiastic. the way she talks and communicates with me feels different. she easily gets upset over trivial things. she seems to be a different person all of a sudden. i actually asked her what's wrong, but she assures me everything is ok and something is just bugging her.. i asked again but it seems she doesn't want to open up.. she assures me though that she loves me very much.

then, just recently, like 4 days back, i was reminded that she has a spare phone just sitting on my drawer, phone was dead and was not used for almost la year. so i grabbed on a charger, booted it up.. and it so happened that her google account is still logged in on the device. curious, i went to see what she's been up to lately, then i discovered her recent searches /history in google and youtube. i was shocked and i dont know how to react. the searches go like this:

* i cheated on him
* i cheated on him many times
* i cheated should we break up
* breaking up a long term relationship... and so on

the searches were dated feb 15 onwards. almost everyday she looks on the same searches and other related topics.

i am devastated discovering this. i cannot eat, i cannot sleep. but i haven't confronted her about this.

what should i do? do i need to confront her? we are currently far apart now due to work, but we will be seeing each other next week. i am confused, i am in shock, idk how to react. please help.",7

"for walking out of my own birthday.. so my birthday was 3 days ago, mum asked me last month my plans for it and i said that i would love for me mum dad and brother to go to a nice restaurant and have dinner, she agreed and thought it was a great idea. 
i made a point of saying that all i want is us to celebrate ny birthday and i do not want anyone else to join us. 

i get a text from my mum to tell me to get to her place at 5 (this was 2 days ago) and so i got ready and headed off. i get to the house and noticed that the lights where all off but walked in anyways. all i hear is surprise and around 20/30 people leap out to surprise me. 
when i looked around the room i noticed that most of the people who where there where not my friends but my mums friends, like people from her church and job. 

i looked quite shocked and pulled mum to the side and told her how much i did not want this and asked her why her colleagues and friends were at my birthday party, she claimed that she wanted more people to surprise me. so i asked if we were going to head to the restaurant and she told me that we would be having a bbq here. 

i said nope and walked out the door got in my car and drove home  

i ruined the party and my mum has been a trainwreck.

"by unzipping my balls. not sure if this disqualified me but it actually happened a few minutes ago. just before my shower i decided to do a bit of manscaping on the ol' vagina miner. grabbed the dedicated clippers and went to town knocking back some of that kentucky fescue when i spotted one slightly angry looking follicle. positionally, we're talking less on alvin and moreso on the chipmunks. as any sane person would do, i grabbed some tweezers with the intention of yanking the little shit out (the hair not the dick). i squeezed the hair with my tweezers, and being the baby i am, gave it a fast tug. and because the universe is a cold-hearted bitch, it turned out that this hair wasn't your standard ingrown. nah. this greedy fiber decided it wasn't enough to coil up in a small ball and just uncoil like your grandmother's knitting yarn. instead, it chose to grow at a near 90° to my taco bender so when i gave it that sweet tug of justice it split open my hog like fedex shipping envelope. and so here i stand with one hand clutching toilet paper against my angry inch while the other types this out to you fine dimes. hope you have a great saturday and can manage to keep your favorite penis in better shape than i have. 

tl;dr - yanked an ingrown hair that happened to be growing sideways and sliced open my testicles like a bag of off-brand cereal.

"i lost my virginity in my backyard, in broad daylight, outside of the car. i haven't told anyone this story before, but here it goes. changing a few small details so the guy i lost my virginity to doesn't ever find this story. lol

i was a virgin well into my 20s. i was raised religious and had it in my mind that i was waiting until marriage and it somehow made me a better person. ""virgin"" became like an identity to me. as i got older, i kept rejecting sex at every turn. i started to get really curious, and felt ashamed of my being so much older than everyone i know and being a virgin. some of my friends were even getting married. it was like a biological clock started ticking in my mind or something, i don't know how else to describe that. around that time i find out a long time guy friend was attracted to me, and my birthday is coming up. i think ""do i really want this year to end with me still being a virgin? this is getting ridiculous"".

i talked to my friend about everything and flat out asked if he would take my virginity so i wouldn't have to feel like an outcast anymore. he agreed to help me out. 

this is where it gets nasty, so to prevent this from becoming nsfw/pornographic, i'll make it brief.

we ended up having sex before we got into the house. i pretty much jumped him. we were supposed to hang out for a couple hours before anything happened between us, but as soon as we were going around the back of the house i started kissing him and one thing led to another.
we were out in the open (around noon!!!) and our neighbors easily could have seen us. at the moment, i didn't even think about how reckless it was. we didn't use condoms either.

..i never thought i would lose it that way. i kind of regretted it for a while, but i've come to terms with it. 

the bright side? i didn't get caught or become pregnant so that's a plus.

"by dropping a boob carrot in front of my teacher. so this actually happened back in high school. tried to come up with a better title but this was the best i could do. 

so i've always been pretty busty. in hs i frequently used to wear tank tops to school (summers were brutal) and during lunch my friends would make it a game to try and throw food in between my breasts. 

(disclaimer: this sounds horrible but it really wasn't, we were all just messing around and they'd only throw things like grapes, carrots, cheetos etc. it was kind of like a competition and tbh pretty entertaining). 

anyway, one day they're trying to throw baby carrots at my boobs and i guess one throw was particularly well aimed because it went straight down my bra. we all laugh about it, and i spend a minute digging around my bra trying to find it. but i guess i must have missed it, or another carrot was also in my bra or something. 

after lunch my friend and i head to our english class. we had this awesome male teacher that everyone loved. during class i had to ask him a question so i got up and walked over to him. after i talked with him i turned around to leave when he said: ""uh.... is that your carrot?""

i turned back around and we both just stared at this wilted baby carrot on the ground between us. it's this moment where i know he's wondering how tf that carrot fell out of my body, and i'm thinking about how i dropped my titty carrot in front of my favorite teacher. 

i kind of just slowly pick the carrot up, say "".....yes...."" and go back to my seat.

"when you see someone being harassed in public, act like you know them and get them out of the situation.. i took a course on civic courage (?) last week and we were taught to not approach the perpetrators when we see a dangerous situation in public -- that would not help the victim, and would just lead to us getting punched in the face too. instead, we're supposed to reach out to the victim, address them by name and ask them to come with us. this gets them out of the situation without needlessly endangering you.

example (we watched a video on this): two drunk guys enter a subway car and start bullying a skinny young guy reading a book (taking the book away, not letting him get up). another passenger goes over (but doesn't get too close) and says, ""hey, peter, i haven't seen you in a while, why don't you sit with me? how's the girlfriend?""

the people doing the workshop were former policemen and say this works 9 out of 10 times.

"by training my dog to eat only when i sing to her.. although this has taken place over the last few weeks,  i just realized what happened today. 

i have a german shepherd, kelly, who is the sweetest dog ever. she has always been very shy about eating around my other dog, so they eat separately. it started when i would sing her a little tune while filling her bowl, and then it became a little fun thing that my husband and i both did. we would sing such hits as ""kelly and the jets"" and ""(you're the) kelly in disguise)"" where we would change several lyrics to make the song about her. 

this morning before work, i filled her bowl like i always do, and she just sat there and stared me down. confused, i walked away to go get ready for work. i came back and she was still staring, food bowl still full. and that's when it hit me. so i started singing ""she's got electric toots, a brown-fur suit, you know i read it in a magazine! ohhhhhhh! k-k-k-kelly and the jets!""

and sure enough, the little shit started eating.

tl;dr: my dog only eats when i sing like i'm her jester, and now i have to make up more songs to appease her.

"reddit is too hard to actively participate in due to ridiculous sub rules, post formating, tyrannical mods, and rude users. no wonder a majority of the user base doesn't participate.. i don't quite know where to start, but so many subs make it frustrating to actively participate in them. if you want to post content, you have to first check sub rules, then make sure the post title is formatted, and then hope that the mods don't use the extremely vague rules to remove your post. even if your posts stays up, you have to then make sure people aren't rude assholes about what opinions or content you dare share.

it's like a pack of ravenous wolves waiting to rip whatever words you have to shreds.
do you have a cool idea for something, and want to share? well that's too bad, because a dozen users are waiting to tell you how you're wrong, and your ideas are terrible.

so you have to find good content, and meticulously make sure it fits sub rules, nazi mod's personal tastes, and make sure it can't get picked apart by smartass redditors looking to ""well actually"" you with some swift ""facts"" they pulled from a 10 year old unreputable article. 

it's exhausting. on top of which, reddit sometimes blocks posting for a number of minutes in certain subs, so if you fuck up a title by accident, you have to wait 5-10 minutes to actually fix your mistakes, and by then, i'm usually just frustrated beyond interest anymore. 

it's just not a fun environment to participate in. no wonder people respond with generic jokes and low efforts comments, because that's the easiest way to just slide into participating without worrying about much. 

posting opinions is exhausting, no matter how innocent you think they are, or even if you are just having fun with hypotheticals. an opinion post always has to be self aware enough to deconstruct every smartass counter argument before you even hit the submit button, and it's exhausting. 

want to ask/ express why the new corvette should be offered in purple? well you'll have 20 people tell you it's stupid, it's not financially feasible, and it'll never sell. 

defending yourself on anything just gets you in trouble, and mods with never take your side with anything. a mod will never side with you over another mod. you can't barter with these people. you can't logically defend anything against their decisions. 

no matter how innocent the sub seems, the mods always seem to be on a power trip. 

it's honestly just not ""fun"". the ""reddit is fun"" app should be named ""reddit isn't fun"". 

i honestly don't understand what it is about human nature, where eveyone has to be a negative dickhead. i don't get why everything has to be overly structured to the point of sucking the very enjoyment from the activity. 

and those are both rhetorical questions. something most redditors can't grasp for some reason. 

you can stalk my history. i get frustrated with things, but i try not to pick fights for the sake of doing it. i don't troll. arguing is just a waste of energy on here. i just like to express my interest in certain things, and hope other like minded people chime in. the issue is no like minded people ever chime in for much. it's always people telling you how wrong you are, but never someone backing you up. it's just exhausting. 

for the love of god active reddit users, reply to people's opinions you stand by with something positive, and stop being so damn negative all the time. life can be negative enough. don't let it spill into everything you do. 

fight for less strict rules if you get frustrated, and go through the proper reporting channels to put tyrannical mods in their place. this place just gets worse the more nobody does anything about it.

"by mishearing what my teacher said to me. this happened to me 21 years ago!so, halfway through grade 4, my family and i moved from texas to colorado. to help me get accustomed to my new classmates and not be overwhelmed on my first day, my teacher had me come in early and sit at my desk while the other students came in. while i was nervously awaiting the arrival of my new classmates my teacher walked over and gave me a warning.

""now, the girl in front of you is a dork. please don't make fun of her.""

hearing this, the nine-year-old me instantly came to this poor girl's defence. the teacher had just called her a dork, and i thought this was extremely mean. so i tried to help this unmet girls aid by showing our camaraderie to the teacher:

""that's okay, there's nothing wrong with that. in fact, i used to be one too!"" after admitting this to my teacher i was suddenly overcome with a fear that teacher would think of me as a dork forever, abandoning my plan of trying to help this girl i quickly added, ""but then i grew out of it.""

the teacher gave me the most puzzled look i have ever seen and seemed like she was about to say more but decided against it and left.all the kids came in and sat down at their desk and i looked up at the girl in front of me and realized i had misheard what my teacher said. the girl wasn't a dork; she was a dwarf. i had just told the teacher i used to be a dwarf, but i had grown out of it.

"ny i found out my parents have most-likely been stalking me. what do i do?. i posted this thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbnnqn/someone_has_tried_to_impersonate_me_and_those/) yesterday asking for help because i thought someone who may want to hurt me may be impersonating me by sending messages to my contacts, interfering with my relationships, and causing trouble at work.

&#x200b;

after posting, i shared what happened to a small group of people, who started sleuthing through what-ifs. they thought that my ex-boyfriend may be behind the behavior and the app we found, but it didn't add up to me. they suggested that i look through old text messages to see if i could determine where i went that day (e.g., if i had met up with him and he had access to the phone). i used my google location data to find out where i was on the date and time of the app installation, and it turns out i was at my parents' house.

&#x200b;

suddenly, most of these things make sense. my dad has a history of financial interference and abuse.  three years ago, he opened a series of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and refused to pay. he ruined my credit. my mother begged me not to go to the police, so i didn't. instead, i paid them off and worked very hard to rebuild my credit. he promised to pay me back and has not paid a dime to this day. 

 my parents have both expressed discontent with me considering my former landlord ""family"". they were quite vocally upset when i broke from the shared family phone plan, and opened a new plan with two of my sisters. they blamed me for influencing those sisters (who are both adults) to move out on their own. they are very conservative muslims who disagree with my lifestyle. i feel as if they tried to interfere so that i would have no one left, and have no choice but to come home to them, as moving home until i get married is something that they've begged me to do for years.

&#x200b;

what legal recourse should i take now? i instructed my sisters to also scan their phones. one of them found similar stalkerware, while the other did not.

we have younger siblings who still live at home, so my sisters are hesitant to do anything that may get my parents sent away/harm my younger siblings' relationship to our parents. i, however, do not care what happens to them –– i have forgiven them once before for crossing the line with credit cards, so i do not care what happens to them now.",2
"for walking out of an intervention my family surprised me with?. basically, i think everyone's overreacting.

i'm 23 and i got incredibly drunk at a party two weekends ago and ended up with alcohol poisoning. i do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings. 

i spent the rest of weekend in the hospital recovering. it was a one time stupid mistake. 

yesterday, i went over to my parent's house for dinner. 

when i walked in, they were all sitting in the living room with somebody i'd never seen before.

i asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. i did and the man i didn't know started talking. 

to summarize, he said that my family was worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment.

i got upset and said that everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. i said that i realized that i had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. i stood up and walked out at that point. 

my mom ran out after me with the interventionist and said that they only did this because they loved me. 

i said that everyone was acting crazy and i hopped in my car and went home. 

my brother has been texting me begging me to reconsider but i haven't answered. 

everyone is crazy overreacting. getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. it just happened once and i regret it. i have a good job and i look after myself. i don't think i need rehab or that intervention.

"college applications should be completely anonymous.. as the title says i think applications for college should be completely anonymous. they should only get your grades, test scores, extra curricular activities, etc. there is no reason for the schools to even know your gender, race, or economic background. i don't think any one applicant should be given even a fraction of an edge based off of any of those criteria. it should be 100% merit based. 

i was advised to add a little more to this but i don't really have any more to add. it's simple really, i don't understand why it is necessary for the admissions team to even know these characteristics. while obviously for many schools there are interviews, in those cases it would be anonymous up until you where offered to come in for an interview. they shouldn't even be given a name, just an application number at the top. this would combat racism, sexism, nepotism, and hopefully any other bias that might affect the application process if even by a small percent.

"tifupdate by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital. hey everyone. this happened a few weeks ago but i haven't had time and just wanted to make sure everything had settled down before updating.

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvg72z/tifu_by_thinking_my_daughter_was_being_raped_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

in the original post i left out some details that caused a lot of confusion so i will clear those up now. when i went into the room i grabbed his shoulders and started screaming at him. he stood up and i pushed him down. i went over to my daughter to make sure she was okay and she was screaming that it was a fetish. her bf was unconscious and we sat there trying to wake him up. he woke up and was conscious but was shocked/confused. he was wearing his jeans with his wiener out while they were having sex and was also shirtless, so i wrapped a blanket around him to cover his genitals and upper body and helped him into the car. in the car he zipped himself up and i gave him my sweater to wear. i realize now how my original post might sound like i was driving him around unconscious but i would have called the ambulance and not tried driving him myself as this would've been life or death so i'm sorry this was misleading. hell, i probably wouldn't have been able to carry him to the car (i'm just a strong but average sized lady :p) anyways, since he was conscious at the hospital they just had a nurse check up on him but he had to wait to see a doctor so he was in the er for a while. 

the doctor did some scans and found that her bf (thankfully) didn't have any injuries. he said that most likely her bf fainted since he didn't hit anything on the way down and woke up shortly after. her bf has also fainted before (long story) so thankfully he was unconscious due to the fainting and not the actual knockout. 

after the doctor determined he didn't have any injuries i called his parents to tell them, and they decided they didn't need to make the long trip. my daughter's bf begged me not to tell them the specifics of what had happened so we kept it at that.

for my daughter, we had a conversation about her kink. she says she has a safe word and has never had to use it and her bf always takes care of her after sex to make sure she is okay and loved. i told her that i didn't want her to be afraid to have sex at home because it's a safe place and i don't want her to feel bad over this. i installed a lock on her door as a little ""i'm sorry"" gift. i think this is something i should have done a while ago to give her some privacy, and i'm glad i've got that covered now. i also vowed to never have any surprise visits again. 

for her bf i got him a card, some chocolate, and i paid for him to have a night at an airbnb with her so they could have a private night together.

"nyc we made a child protective services report on another tenant in our building, and now they and their extended family (who rent multiple units) are acting menacing towards us. we had to get a police escort out of our apartment this morning. what rights/recourse do we have?. around 2 this morning, we heard the babies crying across the hall and the parents shouting at them and what sounded like them being hit through our vents. we called the police, and they said they'd send acs within 24 hours. they showed up around 5 am, buzzing our apartment to be let in, and came up to talk to my wife (who made the call), and then they started speaking with other apartments and the one across the hall that we reported. many of the apartments are rented by the same extended family (at least 3 out of 8 but i think more than that), so they all found out, of course, and when we were getting ready to leave, they were all out screaming in the hall. my wife called a police escort to get her out of the building, and even they were flustered, and said that we should call them whenever we're entering or leaving. clearly, this isn't sustainable. this is a family that has had the cops called before for domestic disputes (one of the men was choking one of the women out in front of the building one night) and for quality of life reports (smoking in the building, loud parties on weeknights that go to the early morning, etc.), and apparently they've been in the building for a few decades.

we signed our year sublease beginning october 1st, so we obviously need to break our lease early. my wife got a hotel for the time being, and is afraid to return to the building, but i'll still need to return to pack everything and get it moved. do we have a right to get our security deposit back? are there any other steps we should take? it's unlikely that all of the units could be evicted (though i wouldn't be surprised if the landlord would be happy to, seeing as he could likely raise the rent on the units significantly), so no matter what, we'd be unsafe in the building.",2

so, at this point, the shit has hit the proverbial fan. 

the doctors did some pretty extensive blood work on henry upon his admission to the hospital and the results are in: 

henry **overdosed** on benadryl.  

so its pretty clear this wasn't an accident. there was no bee sting.the daycare loaded this kid up with benadryl, presumably for nap time, in lethal doses for his age/size and he had a reaction that nearly killed him. 

the daycare is mum right now and not talking. laura is actively looking for a lawyer.

"if i buy my girlfriend a cheap engagement ring?. i guess it goes without saying that i am proposing, but i should mention my girlfriend doesn't know i will be. i picked out a ring i think she'll like. she never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. so i found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. she loves green and gold jewellery, and i spent a long time finding this one. it's a created emerald which i think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

the ring is cheap. it was £300 and has actually gone down to £180. i mentioned this to my sister who said i was a dick, essentially. apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. she says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. i'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

i could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. i certainly wouldn't know why i'm paying more, i don't think she would either. however, i am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new tv for £250. i kind of realised i'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and i started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. so wibta?

"teachers should not be allowed to express their political opinions in school.. bit of context for this. when i was 16 (in 2006) i studies politics in the uk. both my teachers supported labour as did almost all of the class, but that isn't the issue. the issue came about when i made a prediction that the conservatives would win the next general election (they did). now, this wasn't me declaring any support for either party. it was literally just an observation. my teacher then went on to explain how bad the conservative party is, how everybody in the class should vote labour and that i was a 'tory boy'. basically for the next two years my opinions and views in class were null and void because, and i quote, ""don't listen to the tory boy"". also, other classmates who had different opinions to the class and teachers aligned with them to make sure they didn't get the same vitriol thrown their way.

to be clear, i have no issue with teachers telling student's who they voted for. i do take issue when they seek to impose their opinions on the class. they're there to educate. not dictate.

"my (21m) girlfriend (21f) is on vacation and spent the night at some random guys house. alright i did not want her to go on this trip but she insisted that she wasn't gonna cheat on me or do anything stupid. and i couldn't control her, i could either be angry or be okay with it so i decided to just act chill and be okay with it. she said it was only girls and they were going to miami for innocent fun. drinking and dancing and no guys allowed. i believed her but i am needy and i love her so every morning while she was gone, we would facetime for a bit, just say good morning and stuff. i would miss her. 

she was out having fun but she'd still facetime me every morning and i loved that. i looked forward to seeing her. i facetimed her this morning and she kept declining it and i texted her asking her what she was doing that for. she said she just didn't wanna talk because she looked ugly and i was very confused since i don't care about that. so i kept calling and she finally picked up and she was with one of her girl friends eating breakfast in bed with some random italian looking guy. she tried to purposely hide him from the camera but i'm not dumb. i asked her who that was and she immediately was like ""listen nothing happened, i didn't do anything, so don't yell at me. we met him last night at the club, he's nice and let us spend the night and he slept on his couch, nothing happened so don't worry."" i was pissed off because she was implying that i'd be overreacting if i got mad that she was in bed with another guy but i continued with our morning talk. she's still on her trip and i don't know what to think. does it seem like she was lying",7

"by allowing my husband to come to dinner at my boss' house. this actually took place a couple of years ago.

i had just gotten a brand new job that i was really excited about. so i was delighted when my boss - who i had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. 

well, mostly delighted. my husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. because of this, i was worried about him coming along. 

by the time the day of the dinner arrived, i had become so anxious about it that i actually floated the idea by my boss that i wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. she was clearly taken aback and responded ""oh no! i really hope he can, i have a dinner for 3 all ready to go."" upon seeing her dismay, i assured her that i was sure he would find a way to be there. 

well, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. it was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.

i had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. 

my boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when i noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. it was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.

i look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. before i had a chance to fully comprehend what i was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. it hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. 

now my husband does dumb shit, i already told you that. but he's not a crazy person. usually when he does dumb shit i at least understand what he's thinking. there' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.

in this case i was just dumbfounded. i couldn't believe my eyes. i couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. i stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. 

i couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but i also didn't have time to try. i heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.

it suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. he did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. 

i could feel the anger flush through my face. for a brief moment i contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. but no. this was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. not like there was any possible recovery anyway.

my boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill there's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. my boss and i are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

he finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. i leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. 

he makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.

we all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.

as soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.

turns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. my husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. he thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. 

a year or so later my boss hosted a christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. my best friend, jennie, was my +1.

tl;dr: took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. he thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.

**note:** my husband told this from his perspective a couple years ago(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. someone suggested i should tell it from my perspective. hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)

**edit:** ok guys, i probably overplayed the ""dumb shit"" angle. yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  from my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. my husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. 

**edit 2:** no my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although i get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. the usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. if he would've done that, it wouldn't have shocked me at all. this, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn't do things that make him look insane*.  not sure why some seem to be taking the ""he often does dumb shit"" to mean ""he often does completely insane things"", when i feel like i was making the exact opposite point. oh well. glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  also, we all have our faults. i joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc.",4

"when resigning from a company, don't tell a single person until your management has acknowled and accepted it.. as a manager who faces employee resignations, in many ways it can open a door to conversation. it's not always about money. maybe it's an opportunity in another department, maybe it's a change in responsibility and yes, sometimes it's a pay change.

however, the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them you've just given your notice, that opportunity is gone. management generally doesn't need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that. if half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company, everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior.

also, accepting a counter offer is not the end of the world as many would have you believe. it's entirely situational and sometimes you have to play the game.



edit: wow. compensation is always a touchy subject. a few things to understand before you continue to assume that i am the world's worst manager.  

1. someone posted a good summary of how the annual review/raise process works.  we get a bucket of money to spread across a team as we see fit.  it's usually a small bucket.  i also never have the power to walk into hr and say ""hey, give this guy a 20% raise, he's earned it. oh, and why not do the same for the rest of my team while you're at it?""  in fact, i have very little control and even a counter is just leverage for any manager to get traction on the subject.  

2. seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled ""top performer"" is underpaid.  i can assure you that that isn't the case.  many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands.  go ahead, tear me apart for this, it's just the truth...

3. remember employment is a mutual agreement.  everything is in play.  if you don't like what you do or what you get paid, talk with your feet.  there is nothing wrong with that.  ",8

"i have horrible social anxiety and i have never posted anything online before. i have been on reddit for over a year and i follow hundreds of subs. i always check to see what's new regularly, however i have never had the courage to say anything. 

i have always had really bad social anxiety and i don't talk to people irl, but i am much less intimidated by face to face interaction. online is different because not only do you have to think and spell out every word your saying, you also have to consider the tone and context of your passage. also people online are a lot more forward in attacking you for your choice of words or any mistakes you make in spelling/grammer. 

 just writing these words and knowing that someone might read it is a huge step for me. i feel so much stress just trying to find the words to say.  the last time i post words online it was on myspace and i was 15. that was in 2008. 

in 2018 i want to find my voice and improve my anxiety. i want to be able to leave random funny comments or share with the world things i have created. i want to contribute to the community even in the smallest of ways. this is my beginning.

edit: thank you to everyone who took the time to read this and respond. i really didn't think this post would get so much attention since the topic is something lame. i'm very happy my post was relatable to so many people. i thought out a clever/cute response to say to each and every one of your comments and i would have responded back to you all but the idea of doing such a thing is terrifying to me. 

your encouraging words really boosted my mood to be a bit more confident new year's eve. i even went to a restaurant for lunch and when the waitress asked what i wanted i looked her right in the eyes and told her in a clear and calm voice. she even understood what i said the first time without looking at me like a weirdo. i know this might not sound very impressive, but that's not what usually happens when i go to a restaurant. 

then moments later awkwardness struck when she asked for me to give me back the menu and i fumbled it and knocked over some stuff on the table. no mess to clean up but still on some days this would be more than enough to make me feel anxious and i wouldn't even be able to eat anymore. i just brushed it off and put it right out of my mind. 

i know there's gonna be trolls out there if i say something online, but for me, the anxiety comes from the fact that i have to live with the words i say. i don't really mind if anyone wants to say something mean to me because i know that if someone gets mad about something i say or do it is usually more of a problem they have with themselves then with me.

i know nobody cares who i am and everyone will forget what i say in a couple minutes, but i don't ever forget. i still ruminate over awkward moments i had as far back as elementary school that i'm sure absolutely nobody remembers but me. i find myself lying awake sometimes thinking about stuff that happened that doesn't matter to anybody at all, but it still matters to me because i have to live with myself. i guess that's kind of what anxiety means. 

that is why online is scarier for me. i notice irl most people really aren't very good at talking. most people like to stick to the same generic lines and when i respond hesitantly they just move on from me. also, i can see in their eyes and hear in their voice if someone is genuinely interested in what i'm saying. people that are good at talking usually do most of the talking for you so they try to make it easier for you. 

it is because you have so much time to think of what to say that i find online intimidating. i feel as though i'm not good/smart/funny/worthy enough to anonymously give my words. i feel as though everyone will reject me or ignore me and i will feel bad not about what they said but what i said. 

like yesterday i spent a long time making and proofreading my first post about how i've never said anything because i'm scared to make spelling and grammar mistakes, and i still managed to make a couple spelling and grammar mistakes. i would have changed and edited what i said many times yesterday but i think that's kinda funny.

it really shouldn't be like this for me or anyone. there are plenty of nice people online who are not out to harass you or put you down. i know this and i need to practice being able to write down and send out my thoughts. thank you again, everyone, for showing so much support to me. i appreciate every one and i hope i keep the courage to stick around this year!",11

"adults deserve just as much love and compassion as animals and children do, even when they fuck up. i always see so many posts on reddit praising animals and children for doing cute, innocent things, and when they need extra love and security there's lots of ""awwws"" and compassion. however, when a post is made about an adult being insecure, uncertain of what move to make or just plain struggling there's an attitude of "" grow the fuck up"" or "" stop being so emotional."" while **i agree that it's important to maintain a standard of what's acceptable as an adult, and that many people may take advantage of this standard,** i still feel that we are overly harsh when taking care of our fellow adults. sometimes we all just need a hug - adulting is hard, and adults are held to an unrealistic standard while animals and children are nurtured. my point is that we all need to be nurtured sometimes, and this is a need for all sentient beings.

"by drinking peanut butter. quick statement, this isn't my account, but u/thegemscout is a close friend of mine and since i don't use reddit i figure someone should get the karma, if you guys happen to enjoy my pain. (also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)

so lets preface this. there's an episode of two & a half men where jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then he offers charlie some. 

so i'm at my friend's house, let's call the friend mason, and we're watching reruns of the show. we see that fateful scene and mason thinks it'd be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. 

two things before we proceed:

1. our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.

2. while it's apparently weird, i despise peanut butter, not that i'm allergic or anything, but i really hate the stuff.

knowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else i'm going to get pranked to no end over it) i decide we should just get it over with now.

so my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says ""get to scooping"" while he laughs in my face

once he's made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. here's where my fuckup begins:

i drink coffee often, so i'm not very careful about it being hot, and assume it's much much cooler than my typical coffee as i heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before i drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and seeing as i'm not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, i try to slam it down as fast as possible.

actually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up much faster than a typical liquid, it's very thick and insanely sticky. it was like satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and i couldn't get it out. my friend is still laughing his ass of and i'm screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and i begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. at this level i'm thinking ""i'm choking on lava"" and ""i really hope i don't die because of the one time i eat peanut butter""

in my suffering i finally stammer out ""take me to the er"" and his face immediately changed
 
i go for the milk we have in the fridge so i can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking a1 sauce, so i grab the sprayer in the kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but i can already tell that i've got some pretty severe burns.

flash forward to the hospital, and thanks to my idiocy i have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and after almost a week, i'm still in constant pain. i can't taste anything except pain, i have burns on and around my tongue, my gums the roof of my mouth, my throat, and can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.

"for my sister and her bf breaking up?. sister, teri
sisters bf, tom

so i'm most likely the asshole but here we go. 

so my sister started dating this guy 2 years ago, everything was fine until last week. 

now a few dates in tom tells her that he is a father to a boy and a girl and that he has custody of them every 3d weekend and whenever he wants during the holidays. 
teri was ok with this surprisingly as she is subbed to heaps of child free pages. 

last week i found out that they wanted to move in together, he was looking for 2 bed places so the kids have a room.
i thought that she would be fine with this, turns out she is not. 

she complained to me a few days back that she hated that the kids had to tag along and that she hopes he looses custody of them so they can have more one on one time. i asked her if she was joking and she replied. no why would i want fucking crotch goblins living with me. i then repeated so it's a joke right? and she said no. 
so i asked her why she is moving in with someone who has kids, and her response was, he is hot. 

i told her that she should break up with him if she hates the kids so much as they are a package deal and she got mad at me and left. 

i then got a message where she sent me a photo of some weed and the caption, custody no more. (he has monthly drug tests)

i automatically called him and let him know and provided proof with the photo. 

tori is now a single woman and is fucking pissed at me, my mum has also taken her side and now i'm regretting it.

"i only married my wife so she wouldn't commit suicide. i really needed to get this off my chest. we were high school sweethearts that aren't very compatible. i've been married to her for 3 years. i had found a woman i think i loved right before we got back together the last time but i ghosted her because i could bear there thought of someone's death being on my hands. it wasn't an idle threat either. i had to pick her up from the hospital after an attempt, she almost didn't make it. i think i can love her but things are so muddy i can't really tell. i would never be unfaithful this just is eating my up inside.

edit: i really didn't think this would take off like this. not all of the days are bad days. i've been trying to help her make friends and things have been getting better. i've just felt like although i'm complacent it was not my choice. i wouldn't say i'm miserable or anything and she has been working on herself.

"opening a joint account with my s.o. was the best financial decision i've ever made. about two years ago, my significant other and i were serious enough to open a joint savings account together. i am not great with money, and i tend to spend anything i get. often, i spend any extra money on paying off student loans, but that doesn't negate the fact that my personal accounts frequently hover close to zero. 

with one joint account, we each deposit a set amount every pay cycle. that money cannot be touched for anything besides the already budgeted necessities like rent, groceries and the electric bill. 

because we deposit slightly more than we actually need, in a relatively short time we built up the account and now both have easy access to roughly $2000 in case of emergency. 

i would never have been able to do this alone, but knowing it's our money as opposed to my money means i leave it where it is. i would only use it in a real emergency.

"kids at political events are brainwashed. if your kid is under ten, they're blindly agreeing with you, and that tendency to blindly agree with authority or party is bad. 

don't bring your kids with you, and don't force your politics on them. 


teenagers, fine. 

an eight year old is just going to hear ""these people are bad."" and agree, not think about the policies. 

if you're thinking ""but who will take care of my kids while i'm there?"" you're putting politics over your kids positive development. 

edit:dozen comments about ""the adults are brainwashed too."" by brainwashed, i'm saying that the kids are incapable of understanding the policies they are advocating for.

this also applies to the two dozen comments about going to church. my definition of brainwashed doesn't include that, and i've responded to it enough that i'd prefer for you to scroll through the thread. won't be starting new comment lines about that. religion is about morality and belief. politics is about policy decisions.

"hospital gave my mom's jewelry to another patient.. my mom, (84 y/o) recently suffered a stroke and was in icu for 3 weeks. she went in wearing her wedding ring a diamond/24ct gold bracelet and other gold jewelry. (approx $4000 worth of jewelry). the hospital staff gave my dad (86 y/o) a bag with her personal items in it. my dad suffers from dementia and is not fully mentally there. when one of my sister's took a look inside the bag, (which was a few days later), she noticed that there was a separate bag for the jewelry but this bag did not have my mom's name on it it had a different person's name on it and it was cheap costume jewelry. 

&#x200b;

we notified the hospital and gave them the jewelry that did not belong to my mom and asked what they were going to do about her jewelry. we were told that the only thing they can do is wait to see if the person it was given to returns it, if they do then the hospital will notify us, if not then they were not going to take any further action. 

&#x200b;

one option my mom can do is file a claim with her home owner's carrier, unfortunately she has jewelry limitation of $1000 and none of her jewelry was scheduled so she would be out the amount over the limit. we have filed a police report but they aren't going to do anything about it, we just filed it for insurance purposes.

"my (17f) stepdad (51m) has been sleeping with my sister (24f). **tldr; i went through my sister's texts and found out she was sleeping with my stepdad. my mom is at my aunts house now and i don't know where my stepdad and sister are. i don't know what to do or think about all of this.**

throwaway account because i don't want this awful part of my life on my main account. don't really care if my sister ends up seeing it because there's obviously nothing here that she doesn't already know!!

the title is pretty self explanatory. i'm still processing everything so i apologize if this post is a mess. some context: my sister and i have different dads (my mom has been married twice, had my sister out of wedlock). my dad died when i was 11 and my mom married my stepdad 2 years later.

i came home pretty high last night around 1am thinking everyone was asleep. i was about to walk into the kitchen but jumped half a foot because my stepdad was standing there in the dark leaning over the sink. he had to have heard me but didn't turn around, and being there kind of creeped me out so i went upstairs. i heard someone throwing up in the bathroom and when i looked out the window i didn't see my sisters car (she moved out but ran out of money half a year ago and moved back into the basement) so i knew it was my mom in the bathroom. i knocked on the door to make sure she was okay but she didn't answer and i could hear her crying. i assumed she wanted to be alone and i figured me being high off my ass wasn't going to help so i just went to bed.

when i came downstairs this morning i couldn't find anyone, and there's usually someone there to drive me to school (i'm in high school, don't drive, and live out of district). we never leave later than 7 but i still couldn't find anyone by 7:30 and no one was answering my calls/texts. i still felt weird about last night but thought maybe it just seemed weird because i was baked and tired but it was obvious at that point that something was going on.

i got a text from my mom around 8 saying she was sorry but everyone is okay and she'll write me a note for school tomorrow. she wouldn't tell me what was going on but my sister ended up coming home looking like shit. whenever i tried asking her what was going on she'd either ignore me or tell me to fuck off, and she was frantically going into the basement and bringing up her things and putting them in her car.

i could tell she was disoriented and at one point she left her phone on the kitchen table and went to the bathroom. i grabbed her phone (yeah yeah i know reddit is judgmental about that shit and i get it but i had no idea what was going on with my family and i was so worried i felt sick) and saw she had been texting my mom apologizing over and over and saying she knows that she's a slut and said something about how shaun (our stepdad) isn't even related to her and that it ""wasn't as many times as you think."" i don't remember exactly what else she said because i only pulled random words from it before my sister came out and saw me but i pieced two and two together. she ripped the phone out of my hand so hard her nail cut my thumb and when i asked if she fucked shaun she didn't answer and got in her car and left.

i was shaking like crazy and felt like i was going to be sick. i couldn't stand being in our house alone so i got my boyfriend to leave school during lunch and come get me. i've been at his house since and haven't heard from anyone all day except for my aunt (mom's sister) who texted me asking where i was. she said my mom was staying with her and wanted to make sure i was safe and told me to just stay at my bfs if i could.

i don't know what the fuck to do in this situation. i'm so grossed out and i can't help but think about all the signs and ways that we didn't notice. like i said my sister moved into the basement and my stepdad's office is down there, none of us have a reason to go down there aside from doing laundry so it very well could have happened there.

an hour or two ago i started freaking out because i remembered a few weeks ago i went to my sister's friend's house with her and they were asking me if i've started watching porn yet. my sister brought up all this stuff she had saved on her phone and most of it was shit like ""sexy stepdaughter caught masturbating"" or ""stepdaughter begging for cock"" or something like that idk. i asked her why she watches stuff like that and she told me to ignore the titles, if you turn the sound off the story doesn't matter... when i brought it up with my bf he said that there's a lot of that kind of stuff going around right now and some people do watch it for the visuals and ignore the title/context. but he agrees that it's probably too much of a coincidence.

for a bunch of unrelated reasons my mom and i have both had kind of a bad relationship with my sister for a long time, but since she moved back in we've been working really hard to improve things with her and i finally started to feel like we were real sisters. i really want to believe that it was all my stepdad taking advantage of her (that sounds bad when i type it out but i just can't understand why she'd do this to my mom) but with the porn and stuff idk. plus she was apologizing to my mom a lot and my mom didn't seem to be answering her. my sister was already in college when my mom met shaun so maybe he never thought of her as a kid?

i really don't know if he's the kind of person who does this (i mean i know he did, but yeah i don't know the full story yet) because to be honest i just don't know him that well. he married my mom pretty soon after my dad died and i don't think any of us were ready but my mom was lonely. i don't know what she sees in him, he's pretty boring and works a lot and just watches sports and stuff but he never struck me as being a bad person.

this is getting rambly and i don't know what details are important so i'm sorry if parts don't make sense. i just needed to get it out and see if anyone else has gone through this or has any suggestions about what to do? is this a common thing that happens??

my boyfriend thinks i should give my mom space even though i want to comfort her because we're both still processing it. i don't know where my stepdad and sister are and i kind of want to know but also really don't.

edit: i couldn't find the edit option earlier, so i put a response in the comments. please read it before commenting (is there a way i can pin my own comment below?)

edit edit: i realize now based off of the comments that i didn't explain this very well: my sister and i have different dads. my mom had my sister when she was really young/not married, then married my dad and had me, and then married shaun. shaun is technically my sister's stepdad too, but she refuses to call him that. she had already moved out and wasn't really around when he was dating my mom and moved in, so he's even less of a father figure to her than he is to me (he really isn't like a dad to me and we aren't close at all, but calling him my stepdad is just easier and technically correct).",7

"houseguest had a deadbolt installed after being reminded that he'll have to leave soon. questions about the situation in general but specifically the locksmith's liability here. (update). tl;dr - things kind of managed to sort themselves out

so i got a call while i was getting ready to head back to the apartment to meet the locksmith. it was pete's brother. apologies for the lack of details here but i don't know too much about exactly what went down, and a chunk of what i do know is sort of personal shit that the brother, who just did me an enormous favor, probably wouldn't want me sharing. anyway, the gist of the phone call was that he went by and performed a third party constructive eviction with the back of his hand. so pete's gone, as is most of his stuff. his brother is going to swing by next week to grab any odds and ends that they may have missed. i am planning on making him dinner and hitting him off with a bottle of good whiskey when he does so.

as far as pete goes, i'm thinking that i'll follow through with at least the early part of the eviction process just in case he tries anything cute. gonna speak to my attorney about this first, but he's still in the wind. turns out he's staying at a cabin his girlfriend's family owns and it's pretty much as close to being in the middle of nowhere as human-built structures get. his admin/paralegal... i dunno what she is specifically, but she said that yesterday was the one day he wasn't going into town for cell service. this gives us the opportunity to convince him that the situation is currently way worse than it ever was, and as much as i love this guy, he's really fun to fuck with so that's cool. 

after speaking with him i called the owner of the locksmith to let him know that the apartment was vacant, so his guy wouldn't need to show up with police. turns out he was planning on coming by to handle this himself anyway, so that was easy enough. i met him over there, he had a handful of deadbolts for me to choose from, and he switched out the lock in about five minutes. we got to bullshitting about baseball because that's what you do in new york, and this led to him accepting my offer to buy him a beer so we could watch the white sox smack our yankees around. i got some backstory at the bar, and while this is secondhand information, the dude seems pretty reliable so i've got no reason not to believe him. 

the guy who came over yesterday morning was indeed an employee of his, but he wasn't on the clock and actually ""borrowed"" the deadbolt without mentioning anything. turns out he is an old friend of pete's, and had been fed a story about an insane landlord who had decided to move into the apartment pete was renting. brilliant. anyway, my new locksmith buddy told me that this guy was officially unemployed as of that afternoon. i'd feel bad for the dude but i'm too busy not caring about what his motivation was due to the complete and total lack of any attempt to verify the story he'd been fed. this also explains the the non-answers i got when i called the shop - the person i spoke to was a manager who had absolutely no idea what i was talking about. he was basically trying to buy some time to speak with the owner and the guy who installed the deadbolt instead of just pulling an excuse out of his ass for me. i wish he'd told me that in the first place but i do appreciate the fact that he didn't just try to go into cya mode for the company/his (now former) co-worker. all in all, i have a new preferred locksmith for when i need something done at any of my properties. 

so really the only legal shit left is the restraining order, and pete very kindly sent my wife a few emails last night upon figuring out that she'd blocked his number. not gonna go into detail but i'll just say that the contents should make the restraining order easy to get. 

so thank for all of the help and well wishes, but it seems like this is more or less a wrap, and a pretty amusing one too. my wife's gone from upset about the whole thing to uncharacteristically indignant, which she's admitted is kind of cathartic for her, so i don't even have a reason to feel guilty about laughing about what a moron pete is!

again, thanks all.",2
"how my emergency fund made a horrible week a little more bearable.. they say you should start every story with a hook. here's my hook: a friend of mine came to my house about three weeks ago and confessed that she was seriously considering killing herself.

after many hours and tears i managed to convince my friend to go to the er and sat with her all night there. she confessed to the crisis worker that her husband has been abusing her and that she was planning on overdosing that night. when her husband found out she was in the er, he threatened to divorce her to make her leave. mercifully, the hospital ""blue sheeted"" her, meaning she was held by law and admitted to the psych ward. 

 i'm a very recent graduate on the job prowl and living under a very tight budget (i've been using ynab and it's spectacular!). despite the narrowness of my finances and largely due to this lovely subreddit i've been striving very hard over the last year to build a little emergency fund. this emergency fund was the absolute tits during this trying time.

i told my friend i had the means to pay the hospital copay if she couldn't. during that night in the er while she peed in a cup i bought myself some tea and snacks. early in the morning i went shopping for a pair of drawstring-free sweatpants for her because she was sad and afraid and cold and hospital gowns suck balls. i also found her a book to keep her occupied, since psych ward patients are not allowed any form of media. when i was allowed to visit her at the hospital i bought myself a big old cafeteria meal with all the available comfort foods. when she got transferred to a hospital farther away i filled up my gas tank. when i had to cover her shift at work, after not sleeping for two days, i bought all the coffee. all of it. i didn't have the energy to cook so i ate out. when all the stress, sleep loss, and hospital time gave me a goddamn cold, i bought some medicine. after about three days in hell i finally got a chance to sleep. i rested so easily knowing my friend was safe and my finances were secure. all of the money i spent during that time was just sitting there waiting for something like this to happen.

she spent nearly a week in the ward and was put on medications. she says now she's happier than she's ever been. she's not out of the abusive relationship yet (that's going to be a whole other beast) but it sounds like she's gaining the tools she needs to take care of herself.

shit happens, mental health is serious, and emergency funds are super rad. if you don't have one, start one.

thanks for convincing me that the pain-in-the-ass process of saving for unforseeable events when you're poor is totally worth it.

"ga got a very bad haircut at a well known salon. as my hair is directly tied to my income is it worth it to contact a lawyer?. right off the bat, i understand that other people have much bigger problems then this, and i know that hair grows back. sorry if this post is all over the place. 

i know no one one reddit can give me all the answers but i'm wondering if this is something worth pursuing or not. 

i also know that there are a ton of points where i should i should have said stop and asked for another stylist but i've never had a bad experience with these people and i'm kind of shy about speaking up. 

i had very long, healthy hair (down to my ass) that i've been growing out for 3+ years.  my hair is directly tied to my income, i'm a (hair) model and i'd say i'm probably looking at losing about $5-10,000 depending on what gigs i can still do with extensions (these are jobs booked specifically because of my hair up until the end of this year as well as paid social media advertisements). this isn't including income i would have made booking other gigs for the rest of the year (i made $30,000 last year in mostly jobs tied directly to my hair). 

a week ago, i went into a well known and reputable salon for a 2-3 inch trim. this isn't a great clips or sports clips type situation, this is a well known, expensive salon. the amount i wanted off was specified both when i made the appointment, in the notes at the front desk, and when the stylist was cutting my hair. 

i have a normal go-to stylist there but on the day of my appointment she was out sick. i was assigned a new stylist instead (i wasn't notified at the time that they were brand new to the salon and this was their first job out of school). everything went well with the cut, but after they finished blow drying i noticed it was uneven (like a two or three inch difference). i pointed it out and they immediately apologized and went to fix it (first red flag, should have asked for someone else). at this point i was angled away from the mirror. halfway through they went to ask the manager a question which i now realize was related to the cut and not just a general question (second red flag). i looked in the mirror and my hair was at least 5 inches off (probably more) at this point. this was probably when i really should have stopped them, but once again i had faith in the salon and five inches wasn't a huge deal because my hair was so long. when they came back i specifically asked no shorter and just keeping it as long as possible at that point. 

i was facing the mirror and they were working on the back and i just hear her mutter ""crap"" under her breath. i immediately told her to stop and show me the back. i have no clue for the life of me how but a large chunk of my hair was chopped to the base of my neck. i asked to speak to a a manager and i was in tears at this point. 

the manager was really kind and explained she was new. but when i started crying she was rather rude saying ""it's just hair it will grow back, you don't need to be making a scene"" things along that line. i was really panicked at this point. she offered to have their senior master stylist come in to fix it the next day but i wanted nothing to do with her at that point, asked for a hair tie and left. 

the next day i went to my moms hairstylist who cut my hair when i was younger and he was shocked. he said that in his experience a salon of that caliber shouldn't have someone who would eff up that bad and he'd ask around. he also mentioned the possibility of me trying to sue that salon. i just wanted him to fix it and he did a fairly good jo by cutting my hair into a v-shape, but it would  be considered a long bob and in no way the style i have bookings for or the style that gets me jobs generally.  

then today my moms stylist called me back (he's been doing my families hair for years and is a good friend) and said he had heard from a pretty reputable source that the stylist was the child of either the general manager or owner of that salon and wasn't qualified to work there. he said i should most definitely pursue legal action and that if this had happened in his salon the owner would already be making me offers. 

the original salon has not called me back at all, but i was fairly rude leaving. 

question is, is this worth pursuing? i feel like any lawyer will laugh at me because it's just hair. i'm also really young and still working on my undergrad so this isn't a full time career. i just don't know what to do at this point.",2

"for asking my sister to be discreet about her polyamorous (male-female-female) relationship in front of the kids?. i guess it should be are ""we"" the assholes, but idk if that's an accepted acronym here. 

apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but i'll try to lay it out as best i can. 

my family is going on a group vacation this summer. we are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. my husband and i are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

it will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (kids' ages range from 3 to 9). in addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

we initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who i think they've been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

my sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and i don't get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. so as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any pda in front of the kids. we were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
my sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

at this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. i'm conflicted though. she's my sister and i obviously love her. but i also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

"i found my husbands secret reddit account where he has pmed girls from gone wild... i feel like this is cheating? me f29/ him m31 - located in north america. this is my first time posting here and i'm on mobile. i'm sorry if i make any mistakes. 

my husband and i have been together for 6 years, married for 1, friends for 14 (we met in high school.). we were out at an event on friday night and my phone died while he was busy for two hours so i started browsing reddit using his phone. my thumb print is programmed into his phone and it isn't unusual for us to use each others phones. 

when i opened his app the entire front page was filled with nsfw content/subs so i looked at the profiles and saw that he was logged into a secondary account used only for porn. i have no problem with porn - in fact we frequently watch it together. i saw his user name and scrolled through a page of comments when he came over to check on me. i quickly closed the app and when i saw him - i'm not sure why.. i think i felt so shocked i didn't want to tell him i'd seen? 

he took his phone from me and while he had it he logged out of that account and gave me back his phone. 

later that night from my own reddit account i searched his user name and found hundreds of messages on gonewild subs but also subs for specific girls. his comments were mostly compliments to body types that don't really match with mine. a few girls had posted fantasies about making videos with men while they do xyz or exchanging snapchat videos. he posted ""i've pmed you"". one of those posts was just before our wedding. 

four years ago he posted on an askreddit thread titled ""reddit have you ever met a psychopath?""  he commented ""i may be dating one now. wait a couple months and i'll let you know"" we had been together two years at that point. but i don't know context - if we'd had a fight or what?

he had an important work event tonight that he was really stressed about so i haven't brought it up yet. i feel sick to my stomach and i haven't slept at all. we've been trying to have a baby and i just can't imagine continuing to sleep with him when i'm feeling so undesirable. 

am i overreacting? is this cheating? how do i talk to him about this? i've never felt worse about myself or my body. 

tl;dr - without intending to snoop i stumbled upon my husbands porn reddit account and he's been messaging people in a way that feels like cheating to me. ",7
"- my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch. on thursday evenings my daughter (9f) goes to dance class with her friend anna (9f). my wife told me to pick my daughter and anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

i pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. my daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and i ask anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. we all order and start eating, when suddenly anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. i ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and i look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

i rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. i felt horrible. i call my wife when anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and i do not have anna's mother's phone number. so after anna is given the all clear i immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

her mother is furious, saying that i could have killed her child. i said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would i assume something like that. she responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. she also said that she didn't know i would be getting them dinner (school ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so i thought it would be safe to assume i would be giving them food..) i apologized for what happened, but still feel like anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

"being on my period and getting drunk. so like the title said i fucked up (it was after midnight so technicly today) by having my period and getting drunk.
if your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, it will fuck up your life.

my son's birthday was yesterday, so i've been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don't break anything/eachother. somewhere around noon i noticed my period got heavy and i put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.

around 7 o'clock everyone left except my husband's best friend, i put the kids to bed and started to relax. i've had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed i treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and i got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos i hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). 
around 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. and since i've got no gamer friends i had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. 

this is where my fu begins.

i was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let's face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). but then i realised i still had my tampon in, so i had to get it out (also because it's dangerous to have it in for as long as i unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). 

i went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when i realised i couldnt ""find"" it, or the string. after some fumbling around i could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. i spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and i couldnt get a good grip at it. 
i was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of the lost tampon wasn't the kind of sexytime i had in mind. 

i decided to call the hap (i live in holland, here we dont go to the er for everything, we go to out ""homedoctor"" for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. but outside working hours there is the hap which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). 

trying to sound kinda sober i explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, if i didnt get the fucker out in an hour, i had to come by and they would extract it. if i would wait till morning i would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  that would mean i would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for i fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.
i wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because im the hilarious one in our relationship, and i wasn't ready to hear ""yo pussy so big, tampons get lost"" jokes for the rest of my life). 

so before this moment i was a woman on a mission, now i was frodo trying to get this tampon out of sauromons grip. 

nurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. 

so here i was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of erebor. still not getting good enough grip. so i take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. 

decide to lean agains the wall squatting, and i finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. i am not letting go now! while i pull gentely i push like i'm in labour, and what do you think, i finally pulled the fucker out! 

i felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here i come! 

before i leave to shower i decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why it took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.

i look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then i scream.. i would't have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from alien..
...then the realisation kicked in.. 

i.pulled.out.my.fucking.iud...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. omg i pulled out my iud.. it was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..

if you think my fu ends here.. think again.. keep in mind it's around 2/3 o'clock now.

in my panic i decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn't nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). my father answers the phone all sleepy, and i ask for my mom. ""well sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, i can help you, no need to wake your mother."" okay... 

iwantedtohavesexytimewithhusbandbutimhavingmyperioditouhgticouldntgetmytamponoutbutnowipulledoutmyiud... helppppp!!!!  ""......""  daddy?  ""......"" ""m. wake up your daughter needs you!"" 

so now i explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said i needed to call the hap again. 
so i did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. she consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if im oke.. 

""ma'am, are you shivvering?"" yes i am. ""can you decribe how bad?"" well i was in the shower, and now i'm standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so i'm getting kinda cold. 
""okay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma'am?"" yes i am dizzy. ""can you decribe how dizzy?"" well i drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy i am.(muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) ""well i guess thats okay also than. are you bleeding down there?"" yes i am. ""okay sweety how bad is it?"" well i'm heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. ""oh yeah, i forgot, so that is normal also than."" 

she suggested to go to bed, and if i felt worse i could stop by, the fact that i pulled out my iud wasn't so different than when i would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that ""would have happend more gently"" (no shit sherlock).

there is still the mistery of the lost tampon.. i think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but i have no clue.

so for not letting go drunken sexytime, i'm now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till i get a new iud. and because i didn't want to hear ""yo pussy so big"" jokes, now i'm gonna hear ""remember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your iud"" jokes forever. not to mention my parents now know i like drunken sexytime.. so yeah i fucked up today..

tl;dr

today i fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. mistake my iud for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them i fucked up because i wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. i did not get sexytime, nor will i get it for a few weeks.

edit: wow this really blew up after i went to sleep! glad to see my drunken efforts brought so much laughter! and its kinda nice to see al the shocked reactions, makes me feel a little less dumb for calling for my mommy in the middle of the night! 

some aditional info as requested:

- a iud is a form of birtcontrol, its like a 2cm big t shaped metal thingy which is placed in your uterus, on the bottom of the t is a little string that sticks out your uterus alllll the way up your vagina, so that they can remove it. 

- no thank god it didnt hurt (dont know if that was the wine of the fact that i gave birth to to kids)

- yes my funzone is (apart from some trust issues) okay!

- yes i'm fullt aware now that i didnt have to tell my parents i wanted sexytime, but drunken and horrified me couldnt care less at that moment.

- i'm 32 year old grown up mother of 2, and yes i called for my mommy

- i could have asked husband to remove the lost tampon, but i figured after that sexytime wouldnt be an option for him, and since that was the goal i didnt ask him. (thank god, cause this would have scarred him for life!)

- as for the lost tampon.. i have no idea, i must have drunkenly removed it earlier.. else it still dwells in the depths of erebor

thanks for al the support, shocked reactions, compliments, laughter, silver, gold and platinum! this made my fu a little less embarrasing!",4
"aita? i (21f) just had an abortion and my bf (29m) thinks i'm overreacting. hi all, i'll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.
i  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( i'm on the pill and he wears a condom). i have no idea what happened but i still managed to get pregnant. i immediately decided to get an abortion.
i asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. he said he didn't want to take a day off. full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.

so whatever, he told me he wasn't coming and that i had to take care of it. this was a week ago. the procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. i went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. i thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as i just had a tough day and was emotional at best. 
he then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.
so i immediately started bawling because i just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn't wanted and i don't regret it, but it doesn't mean i feel sensitive about it). he became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that i was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. he didn't apologize and we went to bed upset. i woke up in the middle of the night because i was cramping and sore, so i went on his couch and had a good cry. apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if i was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights asap because i was being inconsiderate.

aitah? i feel like he doesn't give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it's the 'pregnancy hormones' making me whiny.

eta: thank you all for your judgement and messages. i'm going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. to those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn't want it. regardless, i want to at least understand his motivations. i will try to post an update when this is all over. thank you again.
also don't waste your time calling me a baby killer, i'm 100% pro choice and would do it again in a heartbeat. if you can't understand why, then you're not someone i want to engage with anyway.",3
"has there ever been evidence of spatial dimensions beyond the three we can perceive?. lately i've become extremely interested in spatial dimensions beyond length, width, and height, reading flatland, etc.

i was thinking about something recently. if we have a universe of 2d space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. a 3d object casts a 2d shadow. a 3d object moving through the plane of a 2d universe would appear to a 2d being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

we haven't found a 2d plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as i know, we haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""shadow."" at least, as far as i know.

i've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. but if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them? or have we seen three-dimensional ""shadows"" of four-dimensional objects and i'm just unaware?",9
"by hating the person in front of me at the drive-thru. this morning, i woke up on the wrong side of the bed, mainly due to lack of sleep. i decided to go to starbucks for some caffeine to help offset the long day ahead of me, as you do. at a traffic light really close to the drive-thru, i was right behind a large suv sitting in the rightmost lane. i wanted to turn right, and they did not—i couldn't turn, but no biggie. after a long wait, light turns green, and they decide to turn right spontaneously. i was annoyed, but whatever. (no signs say you can't turn right on red.)

they turn into the starbucks drive-thru, blocking me from going and making it so that i'd have to partially block the small road leading into the strip mall or circle around. i had to be somewhere soon, so i took my chances. they didn't pull in all the way, so i stuck out in the small street, annoyed. luckily no one came behind me.

i guess i was in an extra bitchy mood today, but i just started hating this lady and her stupid massive suv and the little chihuahua hanging out her car window and the stupid tv's playing cartoons in the car and the 6 frappucinos they had to hand her. i thought, ""i bet she's one of those super shallow people who lives for the rat race."" i pulled up to the window to get my drink, wanting this clearly shallow-ass lady to leave already.

once i pulled up, they smiled, handed me my drink and said, ""the person in front of you paid for your order already.""

i had never felt so forcefully slapped by the universe before. i could practically hear the words ""shut the fuck up"" ringing in my dumb little brain. immediately my day got 100 times better and easier.

faith in humanity restored, and i hope whoever i was so horrifically judging had a wonderful rest of their day.

tl;dr i spent 10 minutes hating and judging the person in front of me, only to find out that they paid for my drink. made my day, and also changed my life lol

"somebody stole my identity to pay for their entire pregnancy - fl. while vacationing in key west, fl in february 2018, i was robbed of a backpack containing (among other things) my passport, my california drivers license, and my health insurance cards. i reported it to the proper state and federal agencies, and was certainly pissed, but did not really dwell on it. 

about six months later i start getting collection notices for various healthcare facilities for obstetric services. so i call them up to dispute, right? surely a mistake. but they have my health insurance info, a copy of my (stolen) drivers license. all of the health info is in my name. apparently i'm now 4mos pregnant and have been going to every sonography clinic in the gainesville area on sometimes a weekly basis, to get sonograms of my healthy baby girl. i'm disputing bills left right and sideways for months from hospitals, obs, general practitioners, geneticists, sonography, even ers, when i receive a whammy of a \~$15,000 bill for fucking labor and delivery, and a week long nicu stay for a baby girl. 

in reference to those who are owed money, either nobody is believing me that it's not me or nobody's wanting to actually deal with it. they keep telling me that i need to physically come meet with them, which is fair i suppose, but i live in california and i work, so it's not like i can just hop on over to a random part of florida and tour a bunch of healthcare facilities. i have neither the money nor the vacation time for that. 

i reached out to the local police where i live, who are apparently unwilling to do anything but take a single report and then never follow up ever. i was unable to file a report in florida, key west citing the fact that they wouldn't take a report over the phone and alachoca (sp?) citing the fact that it was ""a civil issue"". i reached out to my insurance company, and they dropped me citing fraud--i didn't think to reach out to them for quite some time, and apparently they were pissed about that. i have no idea if they're investigating anything on their end or not. i reached out to the credit bureaus and froze my credit, and let them know as well. 

at this point, i'm nearly 40k in debt from this garbage, my credit is in the toilet, i'm in debt and financially hurting myself from unrelated medical bills i now have to pay out of pocket. i'm losing my mind at this point and i don't know what to do.",2
"for telling my wife we are making our daughter, not her?. okay, so my wife and i are expecting our first child. she is 7 months along and we got an ultrasound yesterday to check on the progress (my wife's medical issues caused the obgyn to be extra cautious). 

during the appointment, the tech was pointing out our daughter's different body parts, telling us where the legs and feet are. it was the first time we didn't really need the help, because we could see our baby looking like a real baby. my wife started crying, and i was comforting her, when she said the words. ""i can't believe i'm making a human being.""

i kept comforting her, but i waited a few minutes and, once the tech was gone, gently reminded her that we are both the parents, not just her. i also told her that saying she's ""making"" the baby on her own is not accurate, since i provided half the genetic material. 

my wife was still emotional at this point, and she started crying again thinking i don't appreciate what she's putting her body through to be pregnant. obviously this is false, especially since her pregnancy has been so tough that i've attended at least two doctors appointments every month. i show her with actions, not words, that i appreciate her. 

i just don't think it's fair to claim i haven't contributed something to making our daughter. she is still upset the next day. so, aita?

"update on: i'm a female born without a vagina. how do i tell a guy that i'm interested in about it?. here is the link to my first post, if you're interested: original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3o3w/im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how_do_i_tell_a/)

i apologize for the length of this, but i supposed i needed something for me to layout what happened and come to terms with it. so, if just want a plain update, and don't want to read this (which will probably end up being very long): 

i**n short, it went terrible. and frankly, i didn't handle it well.** 

the original plan was to get coffee, see how the date went and go on from there. he told me he had been recently fat-fished (not sure if that is the correct term, but he had previous met up with a girl that was waaaay heavier than what was presented in her dating profile, and it allegedly went poorly). 

he was texting me less and less leading up to the day we planned on meeting, last wednesday. he texted me tuesday morning saying that he was sick, and apologized for the lack of communication. i had classes that day and was only able to get back to him later in the evening. i asked him if he was busy because i wanted to call him, see how he was feeling, and figure out what the plan was. i told him that health comes first, and we can always reschedule, but he insisted how badly he wanted to see me. somehow he convinced me to see him tuesday, at his place, even though he was sick.

once i got to his place, he was extremely sweet and nice. we totally hit it off, he complimented me a lot, said i was cute and hugged me, twice, all excitedly like when a puppy see's you when you get home after a long day. he made us coffee, and we talked about life, school, family, hobbies/interests, etc. it was going very well. we got into the discussion of movies/tv shows, and he ended up turning on his tv, and switched to netflix. i asked him if he watched any anime. personally, i'm not big on anime but i've seen a few shows because my younger brother is into it. i recommended full metal alchemist to him and we started watching that. he asked if he could sit closer to me, i said yes, and he noticed i was cold, so he turned up the heat and brought out a blanket for us. i had my head resting on his chest with his arm around me, and i joked about how fast his heart was beating. he said that it was probably because he had a cute girl sitting with him. in that moment, i realized i had to tell him about my condition. it took awhile for me to get into that discussion because 1) i just wanted to hold on to that moment for a bit longer and 2) i wanted to tell him, but i couldn't get the words to come out. he looked at me and tried going in for a kiss, but i pulled away. i said that i had to tell him something and asked him to turn off the tv. he obliged. i just froze after that. i literally couldn't get the words to come out in the way i wanted them to or how to begin to talk coherently. even though i asked for advice in the previous post, i totally went blank in that moment and none of it was implemented effectively. i tried changing the conversation because i felt like i was going to cry but he assured me that i could tell him. i honestly don't remember what i said because i'm pretty sure my brain shut down, but i managed to mumble some sort of god-awful explanation. he asked a few questions, and then said he wasn't sure if he could be in a relationship that doesn't involve sex. he said that we could keep it casual for now and see where things went. 

even though i originally went in with the worst expectation, i was still hurt by what he said. i felt really let down because he met a lot of the things on my checklist and i thought we connected well. i asked what ""keep it casual"" specifically meant for him, and he said that we could be exclusive, but he didn't want to get too emotionally attached. i guess that was the part that really stung. i told him that i wasn't looking for a definitive answer yet because it was still too early to tell anything, and i wasn't looking for marriage, but if he knew right now, for a fact, that he can't be in a serious relationship with someone that has my condition then i wasn't interested. i know myself too well and honest to god i can't get involved with someone without getting emotionally attached and agreeing to ""see where it went"" would be intentionally setting myself up to get hurt. plus, i think that was just his way of saying no to me nicely. he politely said that we could both take a few days to think about what we wanted, and he'd let me know. he was just trying to let me down easy, because we both knew what he meant. it was around 8:30pm by the time we got done with that discussion and i said that i should probably leave. he walked me to the elevator, in silence, and as i was about to enter the elevator he asked if i would still be interested in being friend because he enjoyed my company. i said i wasn't sure, and that i'd talk to him later. by the time i got down to the 1st floor and out the building, i had tears down my face and i felt like absolute shit. 

pretty much every guy i have told about my condition would later go on to say that we could be fwb or something more 'friendly'. i just felt like no one would ever want me for me, and that all i would be good for is some side action. i felt really alone. i felt that the only reason i had ever been in a relationship previously was because i hadn't been diagnosed with my condition when i started dating my ex, and we had already been together for a year when i did find out. i felt like he only stayed with me a year longer was because we had an emotional bond, but even that came to an end when he cheated on me. i'm not that insecure but at that time i couldn't think straight. i had just experienced something nice, and it was instantly taken away from me. i haven't had many friends after my ex cheated on me with my best friend and i cut contact with everyone in that circle and making friends at university is difficult if you're a commuter. i ended up calling a guy i know as i walked back to the subway. i don't really consider him a friend anymore because he has told me he has feelings for me, but i don't feel the same way back towards him, and he makes constant cheesy statements about me and him despite me telling him not to. i don't want him getting too attached to me, so i keep my distance. but in that moment, i really needed someone, and i didn't have any other option. so i called him, he picked up, i asked if he was busy, and he said he was playing a game with friends and he could call me back later... i didn't want to bother him like that, so i told him it wasn't necessary. so, i did something  very stupid, and called my ex. his gf (the girl he cheated on me with) had him block my number, so it went straight to voicemail. like any insane person, i left a very pathetic voicemail, sobbing and all. i said i didn't have anyone to talk to and apologized for calling him, but i couldn't think of anyone else to talk to. i didn't mention what happened or anything, just that i needed someone. i stood outside in the cold (its snowing here) for awhile until my whole body felt numb. i gathered myself and thought ""c'mon, what are the fuck are you doing? this is not you. you're better than this."" i promptly got on the subway, went home, got into bed, and went to sleep. 

i woke up the next morning with a fever (that's what i get for getting too close to a guy that's sick) but still had to go to class and attend tutorials. i thought about my reaction a lot, and how poorly i had handled it. clearly, i have issues i need to work on. i stayed late after the tutorial getting extra help, and after my ta was done helping all the other students, i went to her office and privately asked her if she had any recommendations for someone that i could talk to on campus. she asked me if it had to do with academic stress or something more personal. i said the latter. she pulled out her laptop so quick and got me numbers/emails/addresses for places i could contact on campus. she told me that she understood and that she too was having issues a couple months ago and recommended a clinic she had been to personally. i couldn't stop thanking her. before i left, i said, ""it's not a big deal or too serious, i guess things could always be worse"" and without skipping a beat, she said ""yeah, but things could also be a lot better."" i thanked her for her help and left. 

he hasn't texted me in 2 days now. i'll wait a little longer, but i guess i got my answer. i realize i am not ready for dating. for the time being, i should get help.

its not that i can't handle rejection, but that fact that time and time again, i get guys who are totally into me, and aren't looking for sex right away because they want something more meaningful, but as soon as i mention no sex at all (for now, at least), they turn me down. if they rejected me right from the start, and we didn't get along well, i could handle that perfectly fine. i cant help but think i'm a defective human, and will never find a guy who would appreciate me for me. 

i have yet contact the number my ta gave me.

if you've read this far, thank you. if you have any advice, things i should improve on, better ways to handle situations like this, constructive criticism, or any other comments, i would greatly appreciate it. thank you.

it's unrealistic for me to reply to each comment but i'll try my best to get to it over the next couple days. i will read all the comments and message even if i don't get around to responding to them.

 truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you reddit. ❤️

"for wanting my step dad to replace my laptop with a new £2000 one?. throwaway because i have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.

i (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, i splurged on a £2000 ($2600) hp spectre with the highest specs. i treasured the laptop, it was my baby. i used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.

now, my step dad is a horrible person. he's always complaining about what i spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so i wouldn't be able to spend so much money. he's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that i paid a lot for.

i should also mention that i don't live with him, so what i spend my money on makes no difference to him.

anyway, i've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. i don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. i could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. when my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear i deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. he's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.

my mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. i'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).

however, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over £500. i understand that £2000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and i spent so long saving. i've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less i will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. my whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.

so, i know i'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. but am i for accepting nothing less as a replacement?

&#x200b;

edit: i just want to say thank you guys so much for all the well wishes and advice. let me clear a few things up as well:

\- unfortunately, the laptop is snapped in half by my whale of a step parent, so there's no chance of repairs

\- also, i know i'm not ta for asking for the replacement, i just know how much my family will struggle to pay me back this amount and my main concern is whether i'm wrong to do that to the rest of them :(",3

my first post wasn't hugely popular but i wanted to update anyways.

after what happened with my parents, i won't lie, i relapsed. 

i had a weekend where i blacked out. i remember getting back to my apartment and all the drugs and booze i had bought was gone. and it was a monday morning. it was a lot of stuff. 

i scared myself so much i ended up calling my parents saying that they were right and i remembered everyone's advice on my last post and i apologized for how i treated them and that they were right in not giving me any of their money. 

i'm now three weeks sober and i took reddit's advice and made a compromise with my parents in regards to my inheritance.

if i remain at least 5 years sober and submit to a bi monthly drug test, they will reconsider my part of the money. i hope they do reconsider. 

i know i have a lot of work to do and i still have a lot of selfishness to overcome but i wanted to thank everyone for helping me try to realize that.

"trevor noah isn't funny.. tds used to be my all-time favorite show, and jon stewart is someone i idolized as a writer, comic and activist. it was a shame when he retired but it was time for that awesome torch to be passed. trevor noah was announced and i didn't know much about him but thought it would be cool to get a change of scenery and a fresh perspective.

i remember he got in trouble because of some offensive tweets about jewish people. not only were the tweets completely unwarranted, they weren't even funny. he was trying to make a jew joke and it straight up and down wasn't even funny. so i watched his netflix special at the time. not only was it not funny, it was one of the more worse standup specials on netflix, and i've seen almost all of them.

so i watched him on the daily show for months, thinking he'll eventually get into a groove and a good zone to start unleashing that high-octane wit that was associated with the program. i genuinely, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart tried to get into him, for so long, and that same lame-ass, tired, run-into-the-ground racial observations, penis jokes and impersonations of different accents that was the bread and butter for his standup didn't change. at least the daily show was good at calling out media bullshit, but now under trevor it has just become a mouthpiece for the media bullshit that jon worked so passionately to combat.

**tl;dr**: i know that humor is subjective, but from my earnest and sincere perspective, gained by watching hours of the show, and all of his netflix specials, my opinion has only solidified that not only is he not a funny/good comedian, but he is one of the worst out there, along with jeff dunham, gabriel iglesias, and... fuck it, ricky gervais.",6

"update: i 31/m caught my gf 32/f cheating red-handed with her ex.. previous post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ay7v9w/i_m31_just_caught_my_girlfriend_now_exf32/

i haven't contacted her since i caught her.  she called and texted me today but i ignored them both.  she said she wanted to come by and get her stuff and drop off my key.  okay?  throw away the key and buy new bedsheets.  that's literally all she had here.
she showed up at my house almost immediately after i got off work.  i had the door open anyway, and she tried to just walk in, and i stopped her. 
she said, ""oh, you can barge in on me but i can't barge in on you?""  i was stunned she had the audacity.  she continued with, ""ya, you come to my friends (her ex...that answered covered in nothing but sweat and a pair of underwear.) house and night, banging on the door when his kids are trying to sleep. but you don't like it that i'm trying to barge in on you?""
i was stunned, i honestly didn't even know what you say.  i just told her i forgave her then asked her to leave, and she refused, and said, i'm not here for forgiveness.  she tried to push through me again but i didn't budge.  she begged me for 10 minutes of my time.  she said i don't have all the information and there's things she needs to tell me.  i told her i have all the information i need, there's nothing more to discuss, and she continued with trying to convince me that there was something important for me to know.  i told her she gaslighted me and manipulated me for the entire relationship, she denied and continued saying there's things i need to know.
again, i asked her to just please leave that i had somewhere to be.  then she just deadlooked me in the eye and said, ""somewhere to be huh? so you already had someone else anyway?""  i said, ""no, actually i've never even considered cheating on you.""  she responded with, ""ya right, that's bullshit.""
then went straight back into asking me, ""why wont you talk to me?  why are you doing this to me?""
i responded, ""you mean standing up for myself?  i don't love you anymore.""
she said, ""yes you do, you can't just turn it off it's not a switch.""
i told her that the person i loved never existed, and asked her again to please leave.

she said, ""you know what, you're not a fucking victim here not everyone is trying to fuck you over.""
i said, ""you're right, there are good women out there and i'll find one that deserves me one day.""
she responded, ""not if you keep doing stupid shit like this you wont.""  then walked off and finally left.

my head is swimming, did i handle this correctly, should i have given her a chance to talk to me?  i just feel like it's pointless, we can't be together, i'd never trust her.  on one hand, i feel like i could've handled it a little better.  i know i told her i didn't love her anymore, and i'm still so heartbroken,  i loved her really deep, and i still do to be honest.  i honestly don't know where to go from here.  i'm starting to feel a little bad for not letting her talk, but i just don't see the point.


edit: wow, i love the reddit community.  i got out of bed feeling down and then checked my phone,  the love and support that you've shown immediately put a smile on my face and made me feel like i matter again. you guys have turned around what i felt was going to be a hard day.  i can't explain how appreciative i am of every single one of your kind words of support, it means more to me than you know.  i'm going move forward from this, but now it's going to be easier for me knowing that i have the support of all of you beautiful people!  thank you so much! i will definitely reply as much as i can throughout the day, as i'm going to go out and treat myself to something fun!

they refund me for one box. 
i wait two days.

&#x200b;

i am so thankful for all of your comments - i read every single one of them! 

&#x200b;

so, what happened? well, i realized that it is my wedding. my fiance fully understood my position and really likes my brother and thought it was a great idea. i organized a brunch with my current bridesmaids to explain my position and why i did what i did. i realized that it's a story i've told but didn't talk about with my friends, i thought it was abundantly clear that being 'different' from my family made it obvious. 

&#x200b;

the brunch was interesting. what i didn't mention in my last post was that the person who raised the most fuss was also someone who seemed to get the other people going more than they otherwise would have. we met for a lovely brunch at a nice place (my treat, too!) and i raised the issue once more. the person who was most ""disgusted"" by it, ""ms. x"" again raised her objection. she was furious and said that this was a travesty and tried to rally the other girls. this time, there wasn't as much of a reaction and the others sort of just didn't care. i told them all why i wanted to honor my brother and why it was so important to me and ms. x admitted that it was lovely and touching but it should be her because *it's her business!* turns out that she wanted to be moh and was going behind my back to get the other girls to drop-out of contention so that she could do it so she could plan the wedding and thus could be moh/wedding planner and this would be for her business. i was a bit... surprised. ms. x was so upset that she threatened to drop out of the bridal party altogether if this went further. brunch was tense after she left but the consensus was, the other girls wanted her gone and i didn't want her around anymore either, so she's no longer being included (i will send her an invite). 

&#x200b;

that meant i had to speak to my brother. as i mentioned he's a doctor and has a dual practice, so i swung by his office and texted him that i really needed to talk. he misinterpreted my comments so he kept the office open late and his secretary/nurse/wife let me in. i went into his office and he was immediately worried i was sick, but i told him what had happened and why ms. x dropped out and that i wanted him to be my ""man of honor"". he was totally surprised and confused. he asked if i was sure and that i really shouldn't feel compelled which is when i began crying (i had so much pent up emotion) so he made me laugh which meant i was snorting-laugh-crying which is my usual. he said he would be delighted but wasn't really good at bridal showers so he would need help. 

&#x200b;

we arranged a time for all the bridesmaids to come together and meet the man of honor so we are having a bbq at my parent's place this weekend. my mom and dad are so happy that he's involved - my dad is walking me down the aisle and my brother will stand at the end. my brother offered a very very generous gift towards paying for the wedding so not only is he standing as the moh but is paying about 1/3 of the wedding. we're really, really excited. 

&#x200b;

interesting story: one of the bridesmaids actually knows my brother - this bridesmaid and i were friends at college and lived away for a while. while visiting home she developed some sort of nasty infection and was directed from a walk-in clinic to an emergency room where my brother attended to her and got her on her way. so there's a weird personal connection that they can talk about when they meet ""hey, you lanced something somewhere! glad to meet you again!""

"my friends house was stolen oh. location: ohio

hello,

i am writing this on behalf of my friend and co-worker who is fully aware i am posting this.  below is a description of the situation, taken and edited for privacy, from a post he made alerting his friends and family of what has happened.

>my husband and i were recently paid a visit last month by someone claiming to own our home. ""i'm sorry..this is going to sound really crazy and i know you have lived here a long time, but i own this house."" which just happens to be the home we purchased 8 years ago and where our family have been living and paying our mortgage. i immediately asked him to leave our property and contacted our local police department while he angrily began taking pictures of our house and vehicle in the driveway. to my surprise when i searched our county auditor's web page, there were indeed two transfers made in july of this year. we were never made aware of or signed any transfer of ownership. when i contacted our mortgage company to whom we make payments, they were not aware of any title changes either but they did make it clear that we are still responsible to make all of our mortgage payments.  
>  
>we made a trip to our county records department but no one could answer how our home was seemingly purchased right out from under us and the deeds transferred without us or the mortgage bank being involved. the department head and supervisor at the records department were just as baffled as we were.  the previous owner who sold us the home is deceased and the original lender is no longer in business. we then received legal council and filed a police report last month due to multiple very aggressive attempts to gain access to our home by a man claiming to represent the ""current owners.""  apparently, our house should never have been sold to us and has recently been sold right out from underneath us. we were advised to submit a title insurance claim and begin preparations to move.  
>  
>we found out that there was a case that involved our house and the ""detroit fire and police pension property scam"" out of michigan. that case opened in 2008 and the final judgement was made 4 years later. we purchased our home using a ""survivorship warranty deed"" with what we assumed was a clean title, but we were wrong.   we have requested that the corporation evict our family and not return to our home again.  fortunately, no one has returned since.  we were alarmed when the supposed ""new owners"" received their first piece of mail at our residence which happened to be a water bill. they have made yet another transfer without notice.  i got in contact with the water company only to get an apologetic, ""i am sorry mrs. #####., only the owners can change it back and we can not give you any balance or account information.""

while they have sought legal counsel, they are desperately seeking any additional information they can get regarding this situation.  everyone they speak with seems baffled by what has happened.   i will run all questions through him before responding for complete accuracy.",2
"by misunderstanding my grandpa for my entire life. this fuck up has been going on my entire life but it just hit me last week so here it goes.

my grandpa is from the south, so he has a bit of an accent and on top of that he's soft-spoken. this paired with my terrible hearing is a diabolical combination. since i can remember, whenever he sees me he always has said ""hey! wanna color?"" in a really fast manner. which young me always politely declined. throughout the years this has continued. i always said no thank you because i have shaky hands and my coloring skills are subpar. plus, maybe he loves coloring i mean hey, if that's his thing then so be it even though i've never once seen him color.

then last week it dawned on me. he approached me and said  **""hey! wanna color?""**  at least that's what i registered at first but then i deciphered it correctly. he was actually saying  **""hey there young feller""**  .. i  instantly became red in the face in embarrassment. for my entire life i have been responding to my grandpas greeting with no thank you.. i explained the fuck up to him and we both had a good laugh but man i'm never going to live this down.

edit: to clear things up people keep asking how would i confuse the two phrases? he talks very quickly, quietly, and has a unique accent. so the two together sound somewhat similar. for those saying this is made up i guess believe what you want? i'm not sure why i'd make up such a strange story.

thanks for the silver!!


tl;dr; grandpa has always said ""hey wanna color?"" which i always responded with no thank you. he's actually been saying ""hey there young feller"". i've misheard him my entire life.",4

"(maine) ups guy messaged me on instagram to ask me about my discreetly packaged order. is this legal? who should i talk to?. i got a dm request three weeks ago that i only saw today. it was form someone i don't know who lives in my area and works for ups(i googled his name, it said his job title and where he lives). he asked me if i ordered something from (name of adult website). i did, in fact order something from the website, but the package return address has a corporate name (discreet packaging) on it instead of the website name. i don't remember the package being damaged, but either way i'm not sure why this guy would ask me that, and why the question would come from his personal instagram account. 

i'm more than a little creeped out by this, and i want to know if this is just poor taste or if it's illegal to ask personal questions about the deliveries. if it's illegal, who would i talk to to report him?",2
"if i decline my twin stepdaughter's request to adopt her?. wife and i got married as widowers. my late wife and daughter passed away in an accident. my daughter was only 1 when she passed away. my current wife had 3 yo twins when we got married. the girls are 15 now.

so, yesterday when wife and i were watching a movie, she told me that the girls were planning a surprise for me on their birthday. and when i asked her what it was, she told me that they wanted me to adopt them. i was really happy, because it meant that i had done a good job, but unfortunately i cannot adopt them. i'm actually glad that my wife told me that. a surprise would have caught me off guard. 

the thing is, my wife and i had discussed about this when they were young. i made it clear that i didn't want to adopt anyone or have more children. call it coping up with my daughter's death or whatever, but i've never felt comfortable thinking about it. my wife is now asking me to say yes.

"for telling one of my bridesmaids to take her glasses off during photos?. i am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday. 

her name is tara, and she is stunning. she's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. absolutely gorgeous. however, there is one issue. tara has terrible vision. she needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. she gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. her eyes can't tolerate contacts.

in our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, i asked if it was possible for tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. i wasn't saying this to be cruel. i'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but i'm just asking her to take them off during photos. without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.

i brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so i could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. i did and it was horrible, but i could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. she left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. i don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. i'm doing her a favour. without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so i would have thought she'd be ok with it.",3
"sister's ex-boyfriend keeps playing ding dong ditch despite us having a ring doorbell and restraining order. cops can't find him when we call them.. i'll spare the details of the breakup, but essentially my sister's ex has been bothering us for about half a year now. we're in **ca**. relevant events since the start of 2019 include:

1. filing a restraining order and being granted a temporary restraining (about 3 months ago)
2. ex being arrested for violating the temporary restraining order and being jailed for a day.
3. getting the permanent restraining order
4. being arrested for violating the permanent restraining order for a month and being released on probation. probation conditions explicitly state he is to not contact my sister or be within her vicinity.

despite being on probation, he's playing ding dong ditch at random times during the late night for the past week. we have video evidence of him being here through our ring doorbell. we've called the cops multiple times and they take a while to get here and by that time they can't find him (or they don't try too hard).

her ex is homeless, living in his car (probably), and disowned by his parents so we don't really have a clue where he is during the day.

it was easier to get him arrested the first couple times because he actually stuck around for someone to open the door, but now he's given up on that completely and he does not seem in his right mind anymore. last time i spoke with him, he claimed to be hearing voices and we've heard him talking to himself a couple times on the ring videos. he's not doing anything violent, but you never know, he could snap and do something crazy one day.

my sister spoke to his probation officer and told her the situation. he's currently scheduled to appear to court next month to address his probation violation.

i'm not sure if there's anything else we *can* do about this situation other than keep calling the cops and hope he attends his hearing next month. anything else that could possibly help us?

"i believe that to truly get your financial life in order, you need to know exactly where your money comes from and where your money goes. in 2017 i tracked every penny in and every penny out while strictly categorizing it. here is the report i made for myself(https://imgur.com/a/85hcv).

i used you need a budget 4 to manually enter every single transaction and also managing my budget. i blew my budget quite often but just having numbers and goals written down helped me to control my finances quite a bit. i also used mint to compare with my ynab and to categorize all of the transactions.

it was a big pain in the ass to do this but i really look forward to the days where i will take an hour or so to reconcile my transactions and make near term plans in my budget. hopefully this helps you to track your spending and really know what's going on.

**edit:** a lot of salt here from people that are upset i don't pay for housing or food but many don't realize i've worked hard in my career to get here and that there are thousands of opportunities out there that do the same, you just need to look for them. room and board are part of my compensation, they aren't free! if i were making 15k more a year and mailed out a mortgage check every month would that make all of you happier?

when i lived in california, i was making ~72k for the same job so this is a substantial paycut. the difference, obviously, is that my col is so low out here. i do, however, trade that low col for things that you probably take for granted. i live on a small isolated and very remote island, i can't just leave whenever i want to and i can't just take off for the weekend or the night. i literally live thousands of miles from all my friends and family. the availability of goods is very limited and we face shortages often. the internet is very slow and relatively expensive and goods take weeks to make it out here if you order online. my entertainment options are extremely limited compared to a lot of places. i don't pay at the cafeteria but the food quality isn't that great and i don't choose what they make, i eat whatever they decide to make that day. i have to put up with a ton on inane rules that i have absolutely no say in. sometimes, staring at the same three square miles and seeing the same faces every single day gets a little old. infrastructure is crumbling, flights are super expensive in and out, my room is only about 400 sq ft of space, etc. etc.

there are many other good points of living here, which is why i've stayed as long as i have but you can see that there are definite drawbacks to living a lower col life.

"michigan. i was denied a restraining order because my abuser said i'm kinky and because of my sexual history.. in october, in the process of getting out of an abusive relationship, i filed for a restraining order and filed a police report and gave evidence such as text messages in which my abuser admitted to doing it. i gave the same copies of texts to the police when i filed the police report.

at the protective order hearing, his defense was that it was consensual because i have a sexual history involving bdsm, and that i was simply trying to ""punish"" him. we did not have that kind of sexual relationship, and hearing the judge asking him questions about my sexual history was extremely upsetting. they were laughing and joking about how ""you'd think it would be the other way around"" that i was a more experienced submissive than my ex was an experienced dominant. i brought a eyewitness but the judge did not want to hear from my witness at all. he said it sounded like a ""bad breakup"" and gave me a restraining order for a few weeks as a ""cooling off period.""

today i found out that the prosecutor is charging him. i know that there is a higher burden of proof for criminal charges than there is for a restraining order, so surely i should have been granted an actual restraining order, right? i want to know if i have any recourse for how the judge acted during the restraining order hearing, because it definitely put me in danger, and i worry that others will be put in danger too. i don't care about trying to get money, i just really feel like this is not the series of events that should have occurred. is there anything i can do?

also, do i have to worry about my sexual history coming up in court? i'm really hoping the prosecutor won't allow it.",2

i wanted to wait a few days before i updated you guys, just because it was a first date and we didn't know each other previously. i wanted her to still be talking to me for a few days afterwards.

&#x200b;

so, i picked her up from her house and i was in awe of how beautiful she looked. she got in and we figured out where to get fro yo, and when we got to the store, she asked me to read all the flavors to her. of course, i did, then grabbed us some sample cups. she got pistachio, lavender blueberry, and either vanilla or classic tart. she left the last one a secret to me. i got classic tart and the lavender blueberry with some blueberries on top. we started the conversation on our frozen creations and delved into deeper conversation. unfortunately, there were some loud little kids so we could barely hear each other, but we still enjoyed each other's company.  we got back in the car, and i went to drop her off, and she invited me in to watch a movie! she wanted to spend more time with me, yes!! she handed me the remote and said to pick whatever, so i picked one of my favorite scary movies, and started it. during the opening scene she brought up the fact if i've ever been around someone who couldn't see. i told her no, and we kinda got back into the movie, bringing up odd conversation here and there. after the movie, i went home, pretty giddy from the experience.

&#x200b;

we're still talking, thankfully, and we're planning on when to meet up next. she's just sick right now, so it's hard to plan around that. i'm excited for our next date!

"my 28m parents 60s m/f are about to meet my girlfriend 26f and they're going to weird about her weight, what do i do?. i have found what could very likely be the girl of my dreams. 

i could accurately use any cliche in the book to describe this woman. my world went from black and white to color when i met her, she knows me better than i know myself, and i feel complete for the first time. 

we've been dating for two years. we're planning to move in together. 

she's never met my parents, and it's starting to become obvious that i'm putting it off. 

i keep putting it off, because i know my parents won't like her. 

my parents have very antiquated views about what a woman should be and one of those things is thin. my girlfriend has an eating disorder, she is 5'2 and roughly 200 pounds. 

my family thinks if a woman is overweight it means she's infertile, self centered (doesn't care if her man finds her attractive), inactive, poor impulse control, and not a contributing member of society, i could go on and on. 

first of all, my girlfriend has been an athlete her whole life and competed at a national level all through college. she went to an ivy league school, graduated with latin honors, and is the youngest person to ever have the job she has where she works. 

she's unfucking believable. 

she's so used to being the best and succeeding at things that her weight is a major sticking point for her and something she is very sensitive about. 

i don't know how to handle it with my parents if they make a comment (they did it to my brother's old girlfriend, no reason to believe it won't happen again) or if they're just generally hostile. 

i've told her my parents are from a different time and place and are very sexist and whether or not they like her will have no bearing on how i view her but i still don't know how to handle this. 

my girlfriend really wants my family to like her since we're going to move in together and i don't know what to do about this. 

usually we talk things out very directly but her eating disorder stems from a traumatic period in her life so discussing it has to be handled carefully and i'm not sure how to basically say ""my parents are kind of morally bankrupt in some ways"" without ruining any chance of a relationship between the three of them. 

should i call my parents beforehand and tell them if they plan to be rude they'll just never meet her? or tell my girlfriend if something happens she has my blessing to say ""go fuck yourself"" and walk out? or something else entirely? i'm freaking out about this. 

*tl;dr: my girlfriend is overweight, i don't care at all, she wears it well and is a perfect 10. i've been putting off introducing her to my parents because i know they'll make a huge deal out of it and embarrass her. we're moving in together and i can't put off introducing them. how do i head this off?*

"by letting my wife nair my butt. the male community is pretty split on the forest vs clearing debate when it comes to bums. i happen to like a well manicured booty. normally, i use a trimmer with no gaurd because it's fast and trying to manuver a razor back there is far too risky. i do this every couple of weeks or so.

the downside to this method is that it doesnt get super close and leaves a a little butt stubble. i was lamenting this fact to my wife when she lit up and offered up a genius solution. ""you should let me nair your butt."" said she, with a gleam in her eyes. ""its easier than a trimmer and it will make your butt super smooth.""

""well, okay."" says i.

elated, she runs to grab the tube, sits down face level with my butt and goes to town with a little more fervor than you would expect for someone tasked with rubbing cream on a hairy man butt. marriage is strange. a few minutes later, i wash it off in the shower and we gush over how baby-smooth things are down there. i mean a baby dolphin would be jealous of this thing. it was like silk and rubber got together for a night of sweet love and produced an offspring. i finally understood what that santara song was about. all was good in the world. or so i thought.

the next day i noticed some slight itchiness, but i figured it would pass, so i just tried to ignore it and focused on not scratching it as best as i could. later that night, my wife and i got undressed and got in the shower together. we were having an unrelated conversation, when i remembered the itchiness i had been feeling throughout the day and told her about it. ""well turn around so i can take a look."" so i turned around, stuck it out, and awaited her analysis.

...

dead silence. 

i turned back around to find her with her hands over her mouth trying her hardest to hold in a laugh. i craned my neck and twisted my body to try to get a view myself, and i was met with a horrifying sight. like a thief in the night, somone had stolen the silky smooth booty that was there just mere hours before and replaced it with one that was covered in huge, bright red bumps. unable to contain it any longer, my wife busted out laughing, while i jumped out of the shower to inspect it closer in the mirror. overnight, it had gone from glorious, shimmering dolphin fin to 14 year old getting slapped in the face by puberty.

my wife maintains the hypothesis that it was an alergic reaction to the hotel soap possibly somehow exacerbated by the nair, as i did get a few small bumps on other parts of my body, but nothing like the warzone that my backside now looks like.

i maintain that it was sabatoge because she was jealous and wanted to have the only smooth bum in the house.

moral of the story: never challenge a woman's rightful status of smoothest booty. 

tl;dr: i let my wife nair my butt and now it looks like freddy kruger face fucked a topographical map of utah.",4

"by having sex with my wife.. today was about 4 weeks ago. i work in sales and the wife and i went to a big yearly conference at a fancy hotel in a major city a few hours away. it's always a fun conference. lots of free food and booze, with a very nice hotel room. a 4 day all expenses paid getaway with no kids is always fun, and allows for some much needed one on one time as a couple. 

after our main event and dinner on friday (and the 3 hour open bar), my wife and i and some clients went to a local pub and had a few more drinks to cap off the night. the wife and i waked back to the hotel instead of ubering (only about 6 blocks) down the walking path next to a nice waterway that flows through the area of town we were in. beautiful night, drunk, and romantic walk back to the hotel led to some fun time in the room. 

fast forward to yesterday. we have 2 kids, boy (2) and girl (6). we love our kids and our life. about 2 months ago, we finally decided we were done having kids. we had talked about a third for over a year, but decided we had one of each, and the oldest being 6-7 years older than the youngest would be too big of a gap. so, i scheduled a vasectomy for august 1st. i went in thursday and got the snip. easy peasy. now, just 3 days of relaxing with a bag of peas on my man bits. probably binge some shows, game a bit, you know... as i'm sitting on our couch watching lucifer, my wife walks in to the living room with 3 positive pregnancy tests... wtf. apparently the proper precautions weren't taken in our night of drunken love making. 

so... baby #3 it is.

tl;dr i had drunken sex with my wife and didn't use protection or pull. on the day after my vasectomy we find out we're pregnant.

edit: thanks for the hardware kind stranger!! gold, too! thank you!!

"for making a baby cry to save $100?. okay hear me out.

so today i took my baby over to my parents' house for dinner, without my wife. we have a five month old, she's home with the kid all day while i'm at work and needed a break—so i went with the baby. works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and i bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

on the way home, around 10pm, i made a left in a no left. it saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. it's a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and i get pulled over. here in ontario, 'disobey a sign' is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how i know…).

baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. so just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, i just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. baby woke up and starting screaming. when i rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

baby was perfectly fine. i gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. we're home now and she's asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. i felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so i moved $100 (what i would have paid for the ticket) into the kid's resp (university fund).

"got robbed at walmart by someone who i think is my coworker but management says it isn't and implied my job is in jeopardy. posted this on /r/walmart and was suggested to put it here as well.  

tried posting as a throwaway but guess it was too new, and wouldn't show up. this is a side account i randomly created years ago.

i am an autistic special needs janitor at a wal mart in pa.   
the other day as i was going to my car (i was off) just buying some food. a coworker calls me by my name outside the front doors. he starts talking to me and walks to my car with me. he said he wants to ask me a question and opens my car and gets in.

at this point he starts freaking out that he needs money and makes me give him all the money in my wallet, and then tried to get me to drive to a gas station to use my debit card. now i am tiny, autistic, with bad motor skills from a head injury. he is the 2nd biggest person that works in the store. i would of been no match if he tried anything.

in the car he demanded my phone number so he contact me later. he called the number i gave to make sure it was the correct number. thus me at this point acquiring his number.

the next day before work i receive 5 missed calls in a half hour from his number, telling me to meet him in private. i go file a report with the police and give them all the info, investigator said he would call the number i gave him to get him to stop harassing me as well.

when i got to work i file a report with management with the same info and they promise they would investigate asap!

fast forward the investigator gets back to me and said a girl picked up the phone and he asked to speak my coworker and they said okay and put him on the phone. he responded to all the cops questions as the name i gave admitting he took the money but would give it back. the investigator also tells me no charges can be filed cause i handed the money over in fear and not it being snatched out of my own hands. i have been advised to appeal that to the state police btw.

management talked to me today and an assistant who is not ap said he did the investigation and determined it was not who i said it but someone who looked exactly almost 100% like the person who i accused. who happened to know my name, and who happened to respond to my coworkers name. they wont show me the footage. also they casually decided to inform me i got followed by a car he got in after he got out of my car.

now the manager is implying my job could be in jeopardy for wrongly accusing a person who even he said looked exactly like the person i said it was

heads up this situation has gotten out to the rest of the store (not surprising)

"considering just buying $500 cars and driving them until they break, rather than spending 15k on a late model. i read somewhere (probably here) that this might be the cheapest way to own a car: buying a shit car, driving it until it breaks and then getting another shit car. 

the math looks like it works out great, but i'm not a numbers guy. can anyone confirm this idea, or tell me why it's too stupid to do?

just to be clear, i can afford a much better car right now, but would rather use my savings for other things - like saving.",10

i'm making a throwaway because there's a reasonable chance that she's on reddit.
this situation has a few different factors which i'll try and summarize quickly.

we're both on the west coast. 

i'm a pretty stereotypical cis dude, though i'm not saying that anything i do is meant for cis dudes alone, because that's ridiculous. i just fit a stereotype. i work as a carpenter. i like nascar. i lift weights. i don't get astrology (more power to y'all, i just don't really see it clicking for me). i like mma. i have done a keg stand (poorly). my favourite movie is ""predator"". i love craft beer and i have, in the past, even caught myself wearing a beer t-shirt to social events. i have a beard and a digital watch.

i also have a ""type"", and that type is really tall women. my family is dutch, i'm 6'8"" and i like women to be over 6ft or so. it's not a hard preference, but it's a preference i have, which is how i met ""alice"" (not her real name). 

alice is fucking awesome. she also happens to be 6'4"". she's part of our mutual friends group, which includes some people who aren't straight and some people who are. a couple of times a month, we meet up at a friend's place and hang out. so not only is she my type, she's somebody that i see fairly often. 

a mutual friend of ours (i'll call him ""dan"") basically set us up on a date, and we've had a few. we've kissed, but that's about it, and i'm fine with that- no reason to not take things slow. we really do seem to have some chemistry. if i'm wrong about the chemistry, that's fine. i am personally head-over-heels for this gal. we had been texting daily.

during our group meetup a couple of days ago, alice asked me if i was straight or not. without really thinking i was like ""yeah, i'm pretty stereotypically straight"". i mean, i was wearing a beer t-shirt at that point. alice seemed a bit sad about it, maybe uncomfortable, but i didn't really pick up on it or why as i had already had a few beers. the night proceeded as normal, but she left early and we didn't kiss or anything (which is fine, it wasn't a date, i ain't pushy). 

since then, the texts- which were frequent before- have slowed down considerably, and alice has been non-committal to dates. she says somethings up, but she's not feeling like explaining it right away. it was a dramatic mood change. i asked dan what was up, and we talked a bit. he said, ""y'all know she's trans, right?"" 

she's what?

to make it clear, dan is under the impression that the entire friends group knows except for me. admittedly, i'm the newest member of the group. it's apparently not a secret, but i really didn't notice- i wasn't looking either, but there's clues, and i realize now that alice was probably dropping hints. she legally changed her name when she was 19, i know that much. she's not on speaking terms with one side of her religious family. she's dealt with violence in the past with relationships, which is why she's taking dating slow.

that last bit is what's sticking with me. i am not positive, but i know that trans women have to deal with a metric fuckton of ridiculous bullshit and i can only guess that it might have occurred because she is trans. even worse, it may have occurred due to somebody like me- some straight dude who might have found out that she was trans and reacted poorly. the question as to whether or not i was straight probably was meant to figure out if i was a candidate or not.

and i mean... yeah, i'm straight. i go for women. alice is a woman. i don't really care about the details. i don't care about what is, or what was, between her legs. i think she's fucking awesome and i have absolutely caught feelings for her. had i known that she was trans when she asked, i'd have said something like ""yeah i go for people who identify as women"" instead of ""yeah i'm straight"". 

i want to tell her that i know and i don't care, but i don't want to invalidate her or reduce her to what she once presented as. i also really don't want to scare her off or make her fear for her life, because i know she's had to in the past and that's horrible. i don't want to accidentally say something that will fuck my chances either, because she's great and i would really love to give this a chance.

i'm thinking of just sending her a message that tells her i heard and i don't care, but that feels too impersonal. dan has offered to tell her, but i'm not sure what to tell her or how to word it. it feels like i'm invading her privacy to know. i don't wanna bring up old memories of being attacked. i'm worried that i fucked up my chance somehow. 

tl;dr: clueless straight dude has interest in a trans woman, and is worried sick about the right way to tell her that he knows and doesn't give a fuck. please help!

update: we talked. she asked dan to bring it up to me. all is well! 

update 2: this has blown up. i can't respond to everybody, but i'll get to a few. thanks for the good wishes and i'm glad it's brought smiles!

final update before i go to bed: if this gets outta hand please lock it, mods 

in case you are wondering: yeah we're official now.

"light i crashed a brand new ford mustang at a test drive event hosted by ford. this was many years ago (10+)  when i just first started college. buddy and i were going to cabela's looking at archery gear and lo and behold the large parking lot that cabela's had was converted into a ford demo ride/test drive event. they had a dirt course setup for pick up trucks and a very small coned road course setup for cars and they had the mustang. 

i drove a truck on the off-road course and then hopped into the mustang. before getting in i asked one of the workers, anything i should know? he literally said: just don't crash. we both had a light chuckle. a few minutes later i entered a corner way too hot, brakes locked up and i went right over the curb onto the grass, and i could hear the large round of applause from a nearby hotel that had balconies over looking this area. thankfully no injuries but the car was pretty screwed up, wheels bent, body work mangled, and fluids leaking from underneath. 

thankfully they had insurance for that kind of thing and i wasn't served with any lawsuit as i had feared. 

i wonder if i'm blacklisted by ford. and since then i've never seen another ford test drive event at that location anymore...

"by not wearing underwear to work. this definitely happened today, though i wish it hadn't. 

a bit of backstory, this morning the apartments fire alarm went off so we all had to clear out for a bit. in my haste, i skipped putting on underwear. 

i decided to take a nap a while later and when i woke up, i decided to just go to work without remedying the underwear situation. ""it's only a 5 hour shift,"" i thought. it'll be fine. 

i get to work, everything is fine. happy hour starts, we're prepared for the worst. i'm sipping my water in the back briefly and reach down to adjust myself.

imagine my horror when i touch my entire ballsack.  i've never been so alarmed to touch my own balls. my pants, at some point, had ripped clean down the middle and the bois™ were out and about. 

i had to explain that i was having a wardrobe emergency and ran to call my roommate who thankfully showed up with a new pair of pants and underwear. it was a long 45 minutes that i just had to pretend my balls weren't enjoying the draft. 

tl;dr i didn't put on underwear, pants ripped at work and my balls enjoyed some brief freedom. 

edit: if anyone doesn't believe me here's a pic of the old pants, new pants and text receipts(https://m.imgur.com/a/rbdfcv2) 

edit 2: shit i made the front page, not how i expected the day to go given how it started. 

a few peeps kindly pointed out my waist size and y'all are gonna be happy to know w/ the help of antidepressants i've been caring about myself the last few weeks and i've lost 12 pounds by eating better. so yes, that 40x30 you're concerned about won't be a concern forever. :)

"it's not racist to enforce border laws.. in fact every country in the world protects its borders in some way or another. in fact some of the most influential/strongest countries like china, japan and israel have strict immigration laws and will absolutely not allow you to enter illegally.  so why is it suddenly bad/racist when trump wants to do what every other intelligent nation does? ill tell you why, because liberal politicians see more democrat voters if they allow in millions more illegal immigrants into the u.s even if it destroys our nation in the process. this is absolutely disgusting. they could give a shit about helping illegals, they just want to line their pockets and take any measure they can to grab power.",6
"if i were given legal permission to eat human flesh i would happily try it. the idea of eating of human flesh has always made me curious, now i'm not saying that i wanna eat humans, i'd just only eat if i were i given permission or if the corpse died recently like in a car crash.

 i told this to every one in my religion/philosophy class where we were discussing moral desicion making. if you know that senario where you're in ww2 and your hiding from the nazis with a group of people but then suddenly the baby starts crying. would you kill the baby and save everyone in the room or dont do anything and get everyone killed including yourself

most people said kill the baby and i followed up with it saying ""yeah, and if were hungry we can eat the baby, since at that time of war, you wouldn't wanna starve""

everyone in that class were freaking out by what i said and the teacher was speechless. and now they bring it up everytime in class. i don't mind it really but surely people must agree with me on this.

edit: this is my most upvoted post on reddit. and its about cannibalism. i just wanna make something clear because some guy just tried to report me to the  doj.

 i dont want to murder people. i just wanna try out a sample of human flesh, only for the legal reasons. i am crazy, but i'm not insane to go on some quest for the flesh. i have more important things to do in life. and if this bites me back in the ass. its just gonna be wasting everyones time because i have no interest in pursuing this. its more of the curiousity of it, not the actions. thank you and goodbye

edit 2: also to mention people are saying ""prion diseases"" and you're right. i don't want to get prion disease, so theres no way i'll be eating human anytime soon. 😂

edit 3: people are also saying ""why not just eat my own self""? well because thats auto-cannibalism. i rather have my limbs and flesh to my self. if someone was mad enough to amputate him/herself and offer me flesh. thens theres nothing stopping me from eating it, is there?

edit 4: so suprisingly this is blowing up, faster than i expected to be. i got a message from crd (cyber security). so i'm being traced now which is jussssst great. like i don't mind really, as long as they  don't come knocking on my door. this is was only an opinion i expressed on /r/unpopularopinions and it was all fun and goofs. like i said i would never act upon all of this. i just want to make things clear again, that i rather do something thats for my well being. this situation is getting too serious, i never did or said anything that was illegal. i know what i wrote was gross and inhumane but doesn't mean you have to get me behind bars for it.

edit 5: alright, if you're wondering what is with this ""crd buisness"". i got message from what i think is a bot. and said something along the lines of 
<mark ::8086 - tracert>
crd~ cyber. 
now i dont know what the hell this all means but i googled it and got cyber security. maybe i'm being trolled but /u/heycrybaby(the messenger) has no karma so possibly could be a bot or someone tryna scare i don't know.

edit 6: turns out it was a troll in the end. i was anxiously stupid, slightly freaked out that i needed to meditate to headspace. but i'm fine now. goodnight everyone :)",6
"if we want equality, we need to get rid of the idea that portrays men as predators and women as prey. i'm not talking about the term ""sexual predator"" which is a specific type of abuse.

i'm talking about the subtle idea that men hunt women and women are the prey. for example:

it's common for women to think that being easy is an insult and even say that to a woman they don't like. some guys also think that, but most don't care if you're easy or hard to get.

it's common for women to swoon about a guy and find that ""cute"". but if a guy does it, it's creepy and a loser thing to do.

if two men talk about how hot some woman is, then it's objectification and dehumanizing. if two women talk about a man being hot, it's ok and they're free spirits that live their sexuality freely.

all of this revolves around the idea that flirting is about men being good hunters and women are hard to get prey.

we need to get rid of that bullshit. that is the root of all these posts about double standards that get posted frequently in this subreddit. and many women are guilty of reproducing them.",6

"just found out that a family ""friend"" has credit cards under my mother's name. what to do?. i went with my mom to the bank to help her get a loan for a home. banker runs her credit, and to my shock, her credit score is deplorable for very obvious reasons: i see credit cards on her report that i didn't know about (my mother doesn't speak english well, and i handle all her finances). i give her an asinine stare, and tell her to spill the beans.

she tells me years ago, a friend of hers, sarah, asked if she could open credit cards under my mother's name for her son, brad. the reason is because sarah, and her son brad, both have horrible credit and topped their credit line limits on all their cards. at the time, brad promised my mother that he'd pay off any new cards that my mom opened for him within a year (that was 6 years ago). my mother, being naive and having a very limited understanding of finances nonchalantly agrees. she opened 2 cards for him, and then he immediately balance transfers his balances on his own cards to my mom's 2 new cards. total debt transferred from brad to my mom was ~10k.

we left the bank. i chastised my mother (in a professional way -- she's still my mother), and i cooled off. i then called brad. for the record, he's a sordid, degenerate, uneducated, pathological liar that clubs, drinks, and does drugs for a living. this isn't a personal attack on him, but just to give you an idea of the type of person i'm dealing with. his social media accounts corroborate the aforementioned.

he said he doesn't use the cards, but just makes minimum payments on them. he provided me the login details; he was telling the truth in regards to not using them and making minimum payments. he then promised me to pay them off within several months -- he lied -- because that was 6 months ago. it's already been 6 years from promise #1, and i'm done being polite. he's fully utilizing my mothers total available credit, has late payments every so often, thus destroying her credit score and ruining her chances of financing a home. 

he already acknowledged that the debt was his (in future text message communication), and also made a promising claim, in writing (sms), to pay off the debt in a certain time frame. i think he has several thousands in assets, but doesn't want to put that toward paying off cc debt -- especially when it's not under ""his name."" what's the best course of action(s)?

tl;dr: a family ""friend"" took advantage of my mother, opened credit cards under her name, then transferred all his debt over to her. mom can't get a home loan because her credit is destroyed. what to do?

edit: i should've mentioned this earlier, the guy drives an audi r8 -- that's a 150k car, but i highly doubt it's his (is their a way to check?). he's a degenerate who hangs around clubbers and drug dealers who live flashy.  i'm sure he's borrowing it from a dealer who resides out of town and owns estate in my area. regardless, someone living a fake and empty lifestyle like this has no moral resolve. nobody with a backbone takes advantage of an old woman who barely speaks english and isn't financially fluent.

update: as suggested by many, i shared this on /r/legaladvice. please see here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ucsjp/just_found_out_that_a_family_friend_has_credit/?st=j6gynviv&sh=89f6406f). would appreciate any lawyers' input.

update 2: apparently, this made the front page on reddit. this is my second post on this site, ever. this is an incredibly generous community that really does give weight to big issues facing normal people. just wanted to say thank you, sincerely, to each and every one of you that has taken time out of their day to put forth their thoughts. i'll keep you updated on this.

update 3: hey reddit family. it's been an absurdly busy few weeks, but there's good news. i've taken the advice of many. i made my mother shutdown the accounts and put a password on them. they're only payable accounts now and cannot be charged. i also became her power of attorney.

i've met with several attorneys, police detectives, and private investigators. they all pretty much said the same thing, i.e., there's really no (short-term) objective of obtaining a judgement and accruing lawyer/pi fees if we cannot collect from brad/sarah. they told me i first had to figure out their assets, then further dig and see if they had any judgements, holds, or liens against them (which may make the collections process much more difficult).

and so i did some digging, and god, was i astonished. the guy and his mother have over 7 cars -- all in their names -- and recently mortgaged a $300k home! i was sick to my stomach to find that out, but at least i know they do have the financial ability to pay. they obviously lied about not having ""good credit"" or the financial means to pay off their old debts.

after approaching the attorneys with this, they said i have everything i need to achieve a judgement and collect (acknowledgement of debt, written agreement to payoff, breach of contract, certified vehicle ownership/title documents from the sos, etc). the attorneys were all sincere in their advice and told me the #1 objective is to collect and avoid additional fees. one attorney was actually nice enough to not charge me and provided me with a template to take to a notary. 


so that's where we stand today. thank you again for the hundreds who shared their thoughts and ideas. i wouldn't have been able to figure all this out without the outpour of support from the reddit community; some who work for audi, others in the repossession industry, and others in the legal and intelligence community that have helped tremendously. i cannot thank you guys enough for your help in sending me in the right direction. so thank you guys, seriously.

i'll keep you guys posted along the way.

"update employer didn't pay several of us for a day when the company was closed. you guys helped me and several others get paid. thank you!. so after some research and still not quite understanding the law here in florida, i made  this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/afjeis/im_an_exempt_employee_in_the_state_of_florida_my/) a little while ago.  the answers were right along the lines of what i was thinking and gave me the confidence to go to my employer and demand payment.  i was a little worried about retribution, but i figured the law was on my side so wth?

not only did they cut me a check, but 7 other employees who were affected like this were paid as well.  no signs of retribution either.  it turned out (at least this is what i'm being told, so who really knows?) that the hr manager misinterpreted the law.  once this person read it again, they started to have doubts themselves, then contacted our corporate lawyers who told the hr manager that we must be paid.

"my (23f) special needs brother (28m) is a savant with mixing beats. my other brother (18m-golden child) stole one of his beats with no credit and has been signed to a major christian rock label. i'm so pissed but my parents say to stay out of it. what can i do?. so this could go on for pages but i'll try to make it short. my older brother timothy has severe autism and will never be able to be his own legal entity so as of right now, my parents have legal guardianship over him. i love timothy so much and when my parents pass i will become his legal guardian per thier trust.

timothy is absolute savant when it comes to mixing beats. they are true pieces of art but the way he wants is that they stay his. he has sold a few with the consent of my parents to national advertising companies and made a decent amount of money that went into his trust.

i also have a younger brother who is the literal spoiled golden child of the family. we have never gotten along and i barely have even brotherly love for him. he had gotten into the christian rock genere and since he has a great voice and is a decent guitar player has found a decent amount of success with paid gigs at mega churches in our region.

well recently my younger brother wrote a new song that has really taken off on christian radio and in august he was signed to a really large (for the genre) contract with a christian recording house. the problem is, younger bro literally stole one of timothy's favorite beats for the hook to his song. it's so blatent as to be undeniable. m

timothy is crushed over this because the beat in question was one of his favorites and he wanted to keep it his forever. i think at the very least he deserves a song writer credit and some of the money from the contract since the cat is out of the bag. younger brother refuses to do any of this and claims it's his song. 

i've talked to my parents and a. they tell me to stay out of it since they are timothy's legal guardians it's thier choice and b. accuse me of being jealous of younger brothers success and trying to ruin his career. i am furious with my parents and brother and don't know what to do. it's so unfair i can't even sleep at night.

she is currently unemployed (because of the intensive treatment), and unable to work for at least the next year. 


what compounds and complicates her situation further is that she is young and unskilled with no current future career path. this meaning that her chances of being able to even make payments at all are pretty slim to none.


what are her options?


would filing for bankruptcy be a fitting option at her age (early 20s)?


if so, what does that process entail?

"by cussing out 916 people.. this happened last night. 

so i'm a theatre kid at my high school and our first night of our play was last night. the day before, everyone on the cast was given brand new lav microphones (the wire mics that you tape to your face). unfortunately, i didn't know this. see, the old mics were only activated by the sound director, meaning it only worked if a switch on the sound board was flipped. the new ones, however, turn on automatically when you pass a certain area on stage. i think you can kind of see where this is going. 

so anyways, there was one part where i had to strip my costume (button-down shirt and khakis essentially) and change into a very pg-13 toga costume, then put my original costume back on as quickly as possible. so after i get up on stage, do my cute little toga thang, rush back offstage to return to my original outfit. once i was offstage, i began changing directly in front of the door i had just exited. this was because i had forgotten that someone else had to get on stage before i returned. so this asswipe rushes past me, and with the force of thor almighty, and swings the door wide open, exposing my asscheek to the entire cast and a good 40% of the audience. i freaked the fuck out and turned into patrick fucking star(https://youtu.be/kaqa2n_o-ke) as i ran to shut the door. here's the fu. 

so here i am, half naked, shivering, super embarrassed, i reached out to grab the doorknob. i made eye contact with the guy who had just made me flash all these poor people, and i instinctively gave him a good ol' fashioned american ""motherfucker!"". i swear to fucking god the door stretched as i was reaching for the doorknob, because next thing i know, i was on stage, pants still down, and heard a sea of gasps flood the auditorium. turns out the mic boundary was just barely passed where i was standing. so yes, the cast, the crew members above and behind me, as well as the 860+ wonderful audience members heard me loud and clear. on top of that, i didn't just say it, i screamed, so that shit echoed and bounced off the walls like crazy. here's what it was like from the audiences perspective:

""say, do you like canned salmon?""
""i'm quite fond of it, yes.""
*door opens*
""oh, there he is! this is my husb-""
*skinny asian boy with red boxers waddles on stage*
""motherfucker^fucker^^fucker^^^fucker!""
*door slams*
""....well....how do you do madame?""

safe to say i'll never be in another production at my school again. 

tl;dr- i unintentionally flashed like 200 people, then waddled with my pants at my ankles to close the door, screamed a vulgar word, and became the most infamous theatre student at my school.

so, first, i didn't appreciate all of the nasty messages i got from people insulting me and berating me and saying that i was trying to ruin this family by calling cps.  yes, i'm well aware of the fact that some cps workers have made poor decisions, but you're in idiot to not utilize it when it's appropriate. along with those messages, i got quite a few from people saying they grew up in similar situations and had been indeed been molested and to please call and to put this in the hands of the authorities.  

i never personally thought that the girl was getting molested; i just wondered at what point this creepy emotional incest is deemed inappropriate. so i went ahead and called and when i said the woman's name, the worker said, ""oh, she works at *****?"" so, she was already on the radar.  i told her what facts that i knew about that i thought were concerning.

yesterday the coworker went on a rant about how she's being persecuted, that cps is on her case again- again, after previous complaints about the child pooping repeatedly in the neighbor's yard when she was a toddler and something else about food stamp fraud getting her checked out by cps a couple of years ago.  

there was a long convoluted conversation. i have to listen to this self-absorbed narcissist talk about herself endlessly and never say anything, just try to disengage as diplomatically as possible and get back to work.  but cps wanted to see the girl's bedroom and they said she slept in the attic, which is a pull-down trap door. which is never actually used and cps was well aware of that. when the breast feeding topic came up, i was like oh, she still breast feeds, huh? and get this, she said that at her age, she can no longer ""latch on"" and actually get milk out of the breast anyway. it's for bonding purposes. 

the bed thing......i thought it was super obvious before that they were having sex with her in the bed, which i personally find disgusting, but in the last post people seemed okey-dokey with it. so, i asked her, isn't it hard to get any privacy for sex? you see, i'm not holistic and could not understand that it's a worldwide practice for parents to have sex in front of their children and it takes away their fear of death. fucking gross. three hours later and she's still talking about all of this, well, more about how she's a martyr, and her mom brings the kid in after school. i turn to the kid and for the first time, got brave and said to the her, ""so what do you do at night when they're having sex?"" and she said, ""i pretend i'm sleeping!""  both the grandma and mom were speechless, like maybe it dawned on them a little bit about how very bad that sounds.  

i'm not exactly sure how everything went down, but i do know that she's not being taken out of school, she was assessed and the professionals didn't think she was being molested (again, i didn't really think so but still thought this was inappropriate and not just a different form of parenting). they have to clean out one of the bedrooms that's a hoarding pit and provide her with her own bedroom. the girl's father was somehow in the loop and will be more active with her, since he's technically got half-time custody anyway. 

she said she's trying to have a second baby now anyway. and my favorite part, her sycophantic friends, even more poor than her, are doing fund raising on her behalf; for what or why, i do not know. 

for the people saying that they're going to figure out who i am here on reddit, first of all, these people brag about not using social media, and second of all, they can kiss my ass; i'm leaving soon for nursing school where i'm going to vaccinate all of the little children!

"landlord trying to charge $75 extra for additional occupant; but the additional occupant is my newborn?. we live in arizona.

"just found out my parents have had 70k for me in a low yield savings account for 25 years and haven't saved for retirement. hi pf!

i just got off the phone with my mother who recently informed me that i have 70k in a savings account that my parents have been keeping for me since i was born. 

it turns out they have just been letting this money sit in a savings account that by my calculation has an interest rate of 0.6%. i'm a bit frustrated that they let a large sum of money sit in a savings account for 25 years rather than investing at least some of it. don't get me wrong, i am extremely grateful that my parents put aside an account for me that they had been putting all of my gift money into from the time that i was born and i truly appreciate their thinking of me and planning for my future. 

the account is currently in my mother's name and she doesn't know the first thing about investing (nor does she trust the markets which is why she never invested the money). what steps can she take to make better use of this sum of money? i also just found out that she has not saved any money for retirement and since i am fairly well off i would like to gift most of this money to her when the time comes. 

**tl;dr** - mother has 70k in a savings account for me and hasn't saved at all for her own retirement. where should we put this money for it to grow the most over the next 10 or so years? current savings account has interest rate of .6%. 


**edit:** thank you so much everyone for the support! i definitely was not expecting this many responses when i posted this this morning. i'm at lunch now and will respond to people individually when i get off work later but here are some answers to questions i am seeing come up. 

the money is primarily from stock that my grandfather purchased for me in my name when i was born. my parents had a falling out with that grandparent and did not trust him with my best interests so my mother requested to take control of the money. she doesn't trust the market so cashed it out and put it in a savings account.

i love my mother to bits and pieces but she wasn't raised with money and doesn't have a good sense in investing or handling money. her father did not save for retirement so she never felt the need to do so either. my father does have a retirement account but i am unsure how much he has saved. my parents are very humble people who live in a small and affordable town and have no debts. 

my plan is to take control of the money and make it grow over the next 5-10 years and then gift it to them every month to help them live comfortably. i have never invested myself before but know enough to know that i can get more from that money over the next few years. i'd really appreciate your guidance on how to make that happen.

"by getting a dna test and revealing a family secret. i've always been interested in doing one of those at-home kits that tell you your ethnicity estimates.  my mother has, for many years, claimed that her own great-grandmother was completely native american, and i recently learned that this is apparently something common for southerners to claim, but that it is rarely true.  i finally went ahead and bought one of the kits because there is nothing i enjoy more in life than proving my mother wrong.  

fast forward a few weeks.  i get my results.  i am 0% native america, which isn't exactly shocking.  the real surprise comes from the fact that i am also 0% eastern european.

this probably wouldn't mean much for most people, but i happen to be polish.  or at least, i thought i was.  i have an unpronounceable, very polish last name.  my great-grandparents were polish-speaking immigrants.  my paternal grandfather himself spoke polish as a child.

my first thought was that the test was a mistake.  my results came over a week before the projected arrival date, and i knew i should be somewhere around 25% polish/eastern european.  so maybe there had been an error somewhere at the lab.  i started digging around through my dna relative matches.  i had matched with an extended cousin with my mom's maiden name, living in the state that she grew up in.  so the dna analyzed was definitely mine, and this was not a switched-tube situation.

there were only two possible explanations:  either my own dad was not my biological father, or my polish grandfather was not the biological father of my dad.  

i look a lot like my father, so it seemed unlikely that we were not related.  however, there was no strong family resemblance between my dad and his own father.  in fact, my grandfather and many of his siblings had a (we'll call it) striking nose that my sister and i had often rejoiced in not inheriting.  also, my paternal grandparents had a disastrous marriage and bitter divorce—an affair did not seem out of the question.

my paternal grandfather died over ten years ago, but my paternal grandmother is still living and i gave her a call.  it took a while for me to fully explain the dna testing to her—she's 87, but we got there.  she denied it and tried to explain the unexpected results with a long ramble about migrating european tribes before i was finally able to make her understand that i would be able to test relatives from the polish side of the family and determine whether or not i was actually related to them.  she told me that she didn't think that was a good idea, and i should think about it before contacting anyone.

i think i knew right then, but it was not until today, two days later, that she finally admitted it to my sister:  my father had been lied to his entire life about his biological father.  

so who is my actual paternal grandfather?  tbd.  my grandmother promised my sister that she will tell the two of everything when my sister gets into town for christmas.  she requested that we not tell anyone until then (it's too late, my sister already told everyone).  

tl;dr:  did an ethnicity test, found out my father was apparently the product of an extra-marital affair and never knew.

"for teasing my wife about finally catching her shitting?. ok so this is kind of a weird situation. my wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. you don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. i've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

she had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. she wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so i had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", i'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

well she had been in there for a while, and i'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. so i went in there and sure enough she was. i teased her and was like, ""see! i knew you shit too!"" she got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so i left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. she was real emotional so i shut up about it for a while. well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so i figured i could finally tease her again.

every once in a while i'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and i'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" she always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when i brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. i told her it's just funny because it's the only time i got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. but i kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said i was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. so aita? i'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

"by destroying my brother's smart home. this actually happened a week ago but i just found out about it today.

my brother rents a studio in nyc but he's been out of town for work. i went up to visit some friends and he said it'd be fine if i stayed at his place. when i got there the wall lights worked but for some reason none of the floor lamps did. there were 5 different floor lamps and none of them would turn on. there was also recently a power outage that affected the same area his studio is in so being the bright man that i am i figured that the power coming back must have fried the bulbs. being a good brother i went out and bought brand new bulbs and threw out the broken ones. 

today my brother got back and gave me a call asking if i replaced his light bulbs. i told him i did and not to worry about it but his old ones were broken so i replaced them. turns out they weren't broken, they were just smart bulbs linked to his smart speaker. they were $60 a piece so i effectively threw out $300 of smart bulbs.

"biomother of my foster son wants to sue me for vaccinating (md). hey all. this might come out jumbled since i just got an email about this and i'm very frazzled. i'm sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.

my wife and i (also a woman) are fostering a baby boy who is almost two. he was taken from his birth mother because of some child neglect and his mother went to jail. we have been fostering him for nearly six months and are planning on adopting him, unless his mother can make a bid for custody back. she currently doesn't have a steady job and her housing situation is iffy as best so i do not think that is likely. how biological father is unknown.

my son attends daycare and last month, caught pertussis (whooping cough). he was hospitalized for two days but he pulled through. we realized he had missed several vaccines, so after he recovered, we got him caught up.

last week at visitation, the caseworker mentioned this to biomom who freaked out about poisoning her baby and giving her autism. he (caseworker) explained that this wasn't the case, and that we're trying to protect him from illness, especially at his daycare. she said we violated her religious rights. (religion has never come up before.)

we kind of brushed it off because she is always exaggerating things to get her son back (which is expected). she's also complained that she didn't want her son raised by two women but there weren't other foster parents available at the time (according to the social worker). but today she emailed us that she has a lawyer and she will take us to court for damages to her son. he hasn't been damaged by the vaccines at all, beyond a basic booboo.

can she really take us to court? does she have a case? my wife said i'm overreacting and that the judge will throw it out, but i'm not so sure. what documents do i need to make my case?

edit: thank you all for the advice! (my wife is now using it to say ""i told you so."") we emailed the caseworker but haven't heard anything yet; it's a saturday though, so we'll probably hear from him on monday or tuesday. i'll let you know if anything changes.",2

we were reading a post today about a woman who said she found suspicious messages when going through her husbands facebook. also in her story she said that their two toddlers were taking up most of the free time and their marriage was hitting a rough spot, like many people struggle with the same situation.

fast forward to the comments. this is where my concern starts. misery loves company. period. the amount of cutting, negative, ""divorce him and move on, gohrl he lyin"" comments were unbelievable, and the same goes for almost every top post on this sub...

all i'm saying is be careful, y'all. especially the younger people who come here for advice. relationships take work, relationships are hard sometimes, and relationships take compromise. i hope that these folks understand that they're probably taking that cutting ""advice"" from middle aged, three time divorced cat ladies with strange colored hair, or dudes who are manipulative and have never had a successful relationships. who's got time for that?

mods, remove this post if i'm breaking any rules. but maybe its a good idea to put some sort of flair on username so people can be a bit more selective about where said advice is coming from. for example ""marriage counseling works"" or ""three times divorced cat lady""

"my fiancee isn't speaking to me after i used ""our"" money to help my dog. not sure not to fix this?. my dog (german shepard) began acting strangely a few months ago. first couple vet visits didn't show anything until eventually we felt a large lump under his fur which was later identified as a tumor. it was confirmed to be malignant and required surgery to remove completely. 

the vet i spoke to said it would likely cost over $5000 to remove it completely and there's no guarantee it will be a success. i don't know why the cost was so high, but it didn't matter to me. my dog is my dog and there is no question in my mind that paying for the surgery was the right thing to do. 

i paid for the surgery out of my own savings. this is important. my fiancee and i have separate finances and my savings are easily 5x what she had saved up. when she found out how much the surgery cost, she went ballistic that i paid for the surgery without asking her when we're planning a wedding. she says that she will have to downsize her wedding to compensate, and that my dog is already so old (10) the money ""wouldn't go far."" i can't even comprehend how she could say that to me.

i honestly can't empathise with her here, which has caused a massive rift in a previously amazing relationship. my dog is my dog and he's a member of the family. i refuse to put a few thousand dollars over his well-being. my fiancee is acting as though i'm being selfish and that our wedding should come first, since we're starting a family.

she hasn't talked to me since other than to tell me to take out the garbage, clean the dishes, etc. if i try to engage conversation she will shut down or walk away. she refuses to talk this over unless i get on my knees, grovel and apologise. i can't bring myself to do this as a matter of principle and self respect.

so my question for people here is how am i supposed to get her to talk to me and patch things up? i don't want to throwaway the relationship, but at the same time i feel this is something i cannot compromise on...",7
"""nutritionists"",""nutritional therapists"", ""holistic nutritionist"", or ""nutritional coaches"" don't require any formal certification, education or training to use those titles. ""dieticians"" do require it. be careful who you accept diet & nutrition advice from.. **edit** 
important note to this. only registered dietitians or rdns (registered dietician nutritionists) are technically certified to diagnose & treat food/nutrition related illnesses, diseases, & conditions such as eating disorders & deficiencies. 

1) some or most people might spell it dietitian, not dietician. unsure if one is correct or if its just regional.


2) ymmv. certain countries or states likely have different regulations on this. afaik in  most parts of the us and uk, nutritionists *can* get some sort of certification and higher ed training, but its not generally required, and its not as regulated as a dietitian or registered dietitian.  in almost all cases, anything like ""diet coach"" or ""nutrition coach"" or ""heath coach"" or ""nutritional specialist"" are bs terms. main takeaway from this lpt is do your research on your own country or state's rules, and be careful who you trust.


3) i'm not intending to imply that there aren't any nutritionists with 4 year degrees, graduate degrees, or proper training. just saying rigorous education & certification is not always required, unlike dietitian, which is a regulated & protected term almost universally. i'm sure there are some great, knowledgeable nutritionists and nutritional therapists out there...and some terrible quack dietitians. again, do your research and be careful who you trust.

"i m 26 am getting married soon. need advice on keeping stalkerf 25 away. hello,

using throwaway because family knows my username.

&#x200b;

so back in 2017 i had met a girl on tinder. we texted for two months before we met. we had told each other we weren't looking for serious relationships (which is kinda why i agreed to meet her in the first place - i was not in a frame of mind to get into a relationship.). hooked up the first time we met. following day she told me she was in love with me and asked if we could date, to which i said no. 

long drawn fights, a lot of gaslighting, manipulation, crying followed in the subsequent weeks over texts (which i documented) and calls (which i recorded). she told me she was depressed, suffered child abuse, was sexually assaulted and that's the source of her rage. she started threatening me with suicide. i caved and continued to talk to her on a condition that she remains platonic. we did not meet in person, but she sent me > 50 texts daily and would call every alternate day. i played along, thinking she will lose interest soon but that did not happen. she asked three more times if we could get into a relationship and three times i said no. of course, the logical inconsistency with her saying she will keep it platonic and asking for a relationship went unnoticed because i was just too chicken, too scared, to say anything, thinking she might hurt herself.

after a while this started to affect me and work started to suffer. i tried to distance myself from her. after about 4 months after meeting her, she asked me to meet her again as a birthday present. i refused. she lashed out at me. i told her the ""friendship"" was not going to work this was and i changed my phone number, deleted all my social media and alerted friends. she then contacted a handful of my friends (who she probably figured out from social media), colleagues and started a smear campaign. she also made suicide threats, but did not receive any detectable response. she then showed up at my workplace, and a colleague sent her back telling her that i have quit. i passed on a message through one of the colleagues she called, saying i want no further contact. she keeps listening to some music i upload  - spends hours at times - which is how i know she hasn't completely forgotten me yet. however, last she tried to contact me directly was over a year ago.  

i subsequently found out i am not the first person she did this to. one of the previous victims even works for the same employer as i! there have been at least 4 guys she has done the same thing to.

\clearly i am skipping details, but i don't believe these are important\

i am a guy in india, so there is no provision for me to complain against her - the law thinks indian men cannot get stalked and harassed. so legal action is not possible. she lives in the same city.

i met a wonderful person by end of 2018 and we got engaged recently. we are getting married soon. what all precautions should i be taking?

"my wife named our son after her first love and i had no idea. this is my throwaway account because she know my main account. my son is 5. about 2 days ago we were out shopping and ran into a high school friend of hers. she was catching up when she told her friend that we had a son. when the old friend asked his name my wife hesitated and i told her. she had a strange look on her face then said you mean like your ex boyfriend. our sons name is very unique to the point that i've never met another person with the same name. now she refuses to talk to me about it. i feel betrayed and disgusted with her. it's like a switch was flipped my mind and i just can't look at her the same way. 











update 1. lots of questions so i'll go ahead and answer a few that have been mentioned a few times. i'm not giving out my son's name. when we discussed the name i had no idea it was her high school ex's name. i knew she had one boyfriend in high school who's name was never told to me and their relationship lasted around two years. i'm upset but that doesn't automatically make make me abusive. i would never raise my hand to my wife or anyone else i care about. i will always love my son and i would never and i mean never treat him any differently. i will post an update when i talk to her probably in a day or two




update 2. so to get some things out of the way first. the kid is mine. i have very pronounced features that he also has plus her ex was black and i'm white. i'm not  going to ""throw him away"" as so many comments suggested. when we were deciding on the name she said she remembered somebody from school who had it and instantly loved it. my wife and i both had a very promiscuous past before we met and agreed that the past should stay there so i didn't push to hard to know certain details. i knew she had one boyfriend in high school who cheated on her but i never asked his name and that is my fault.

so update time. thursday we didn't have the discussion because that is her late day at work plus this wasn't a discussion i wanted to have with our son in the house. so thursday night when she came in i told her that friday after work we needed to sit down and talk and if she has any plans she need to cancel. she looked very worried and said ok. friday came and we sit down after her sister came to pick up our son for a sleep over. i asked why would not tell me where our name came from? she said she was sorry but she didn't think it was that big of a deal and i would not agree to it. i told her that it was my choice too and she took that away from me. i asked her if she would feel the same way if we had a daughter and named her after one of my ex's and she said that's different i wouldn't let that happen. she said that she knows she can disconnect the name from her ex but she wouldn't be sure i could do the same. i was floored and starting to feel sicker than i had felt. i told her that is one of the stupidest things i have ever heard come out of someone's mouth. i moved on because i had more questions and i was about to go off just on what she just said. i asked her if she still loved him and she paused for a minute then said yes but not in same way she loves me and that you don't just stop loving someone that love changes. i wanted to throw up at this point. she could see that i was very upset. she smiled at me and said i should know she only wants to be with me. i said that i needed to know how you love him. at that point she put her hand on my leg and tried to change the subject. i told her to take her fucking hand off me right now and answer the question. her mood changed right there from wanting to move past this to no he didn't just fucking cuss at me. she said look you're upset and i get that but what is done is done so you need to get over this and move on. she got up and said i'm meeting my mom dinner i'll see you when you get home. i told her if you walk out that door then no you won't. she looked at me like i was full of shit grabbed her purse and left. i packed my bag and stayed at a friend's house last night. right now i'm just sitting here trying to figure out what to do next.

yesterday i got a new client and he had the same number i've been using as my ""fake number"".  i tried my best not to show any emotion to hearing it but i asked him how long he's had that number.  he said ""oh, about 15 years, but i may get a new one because i get non-stop telemarketing calls.""  i told him, ""i get some once in awhile too. aren't they annoying *haha*""

he says, ""yeah, i think maybe someone is giving out my number because they keep asking if {my first name} is available.""

i said, ""that happens to me from time to time as well, people think i'm {old homeowner's name} or {bosses name}. oh well. email me if you change your number.""

he says ""i will. actually they ask for **you** pretty much all the time. what's your number? i bet they are getting us confused.  it seems strange almost all of them ask for you even thought we're not related"".

i gave him my work number.

**tl;dr: i've been giving out a fake number and met the guy who actually has that number in real life and he gets telemarketing calls non-stop because of it.**

.
.
edit: so tonight i had a meeting at the guy's office to go over a proposal. i spent too much time reading comments this afternoon (and felt bad) and i told him my personal number was one digit off from his.  so he says, ""yeah i figured everyone had misdialed for the last few years or this might have been your old number."" he knew right away when he saw my name...

so, i never told him i had given every company on earth his number (not knowing it was him) but i did tell him i gave the wrong number at guitar center a few times. dont ask me why i came clean for one place but not the rest of them. he laughed it off.

so, i've learned not to give any more fake numbers and i did bring the guy a gift card to longhorn steakhouse as 'thanks and take your wife out to dinner"" when in reality i felt bad because i didn't think through my actions and many of you called me out.",4
"my smug friend is getting a karma smack down and i struggle to care.. let's call her sharon. 

sharon talks all the time about her perfect marriage and how her husband knows he's not good enough for her, so he would never do anything to screw it up. 

meanwhile, she treats him like crap. when they're together, she mostly just orders him around. but the vast majority of the time, she's out having cocktails with friends while he's at home with their kids. 

he's a musician, which she thinks is ""daaaarling"" but she's not interested in it. still, she likes for him to be in a band because then he wants to hang out with her less. 

last year, sharon met this woman... we'll call her chloe. sharon likes chloe alright, but sharon's husband thinks chloe is awesome. 

anyway, about 6 months ago, sharon was giggling with me and a few other ladies at brunch about how now she barely ever has to do anything with her husband... instead, she just asks chloe to hang out with him and everything is fine. 

we pointed out the obvious issues with that. especially since chloe is beautiful, single and an easy ten years younger than us. she's a singer/songwriter and they share a ton of other interests. and look, i'm not suggesting men and women can't be friends... but sharon openly admits that she almost never sleeps with her husband and now she thinks it's a good idea to encourage him to have a close friendship with a woman he's almost certainly attracted to?  just because she wants to keep him occupied?

ok then. good luck with that. 

yesterday, i had to stop at sharon's to pick up some things my daughter left over there.  she told me to just walk in because she wasn't home. i did as she said and there was chloe with sharon's husband... fucking in the living room, full view of the front door. 

i should probably tell her. but honestly, she's just so damn smug about how ""whipped"" he is that i flat out don't want to. 

also, i suddenly don't know why i hang out with this woman. ",11
"update: i (19f) had a summer fling with an older guy (26m). i took a pregnancy test today and it came out positive. edit: wow! thank you so much for my first gold, kind stranger! that's really sweet. hugs! <3

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/901lyn/i_19f_had_a_summer_fling_with_an_older_guy_26m_i/

first of all, thank you all so so much for the overwhelming support. i never imagined that i would get this amount of positive support and advice for my situation. when i posted, i was in a pretty bad place (i think i typed the post out on my bathroom floor where i had been crying). thank you all for the reassurance and comfort. also, thank you so much to all the girls that shared their personal experiences. i read every single comment (good and bad) and tried to respond to all of them. i appreciate all of you guys so much and it honeslty helped me cope a lot. 

special thank you to u/janaya59, your comment was the turning point for me. i got myself up from the bathroom floor, took a shower, opened a bucket of ice cream and calmed down for the rest of the night. 

about two days after i posted, i told one of my best friends about my positive pregancy test. he was completely supportive and reassured me that all was going to be okay. he drove me to my doctor's appointment and sat in the doc's office while i peed in a cup and got my blood drawn. i was positive for hcg so the pregnancy was real. i was about five weeks. he held me as i cried and on the way back, bought take-out for the both of us. 

that day, i called a local clinic, scheduled my appointment for wednesday. i was early enough to take mifeprex (the pill). on tuesday, my best friend (the one that i mentioned in my original post) finally came back from africa and i told her immediately. she hugged me close and i cried some more (the waterworks were very common during that whole week) and she cried for me as well. 

on the day of my appointment, both of my best friends came with me. i took mifeprex at the clinic and got the misoprostol to take at home. right after i took the mifeprex, i felt complete and utter relief. it felt better than the day i finished all of my college applications. all of my stress instantly dissipated. i knew i was going to be okay and that i had my life back on track. my friends drove me back and we all hung out at my dorm and ate ice cream. i'm so lucky to have friends like them in my life and i'm so thankful for them.

so yes, i had the abortion and i feel completely relieved.

one thing that i did do that i said i probably wasn't was that i told ""nick"". i was completely set on not telling him since we were never in a relationship (we had a summer fling) and we hadn't seen each other in like a month. but i hate keeping secrets, especially when it comes to myself, and i thought that if i do end up getting a position at the lab, i would see him everyday. it would be very difficult for me to see him and know that i kept this from him when he played somewhat of a role in it too. he's also someone that never gave me any red flags and i was also 99% sure that he was going to be in support of an abortion. so i texted him the day after i made my appointment asking him to meet up for coffee. i told him, managed not to break out in tears, and then told him i already schdued the abortion. he was completely shocked, thanked me for telling him then got up and hugged me. he said he absolutely supported my decision and thanked me for choosing it. he then got up and hugged me again. he offered to come with me and pay for the pill and i told him no and no but thanked him for his offer and support. he told me to call him if anything came up or if i needed anything. i nodded, and then asked him if he could not say anything about all of this and he wholeheartedly said absolutely. and that was that. 

i could tell he was relieved and i expected it since he's a talented and successful med student who doesn't even have time to take care of himself, nonetheless a pregnant girl and a baby. 

in all, i made the right choice and had an amazing support system. thank you especially to reddit since you guys gave me unconditional support while i was at my lowest. thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 

tl;dr: got the abortion and told nick about it. i feel like a complete planet has been lifted off of my shoulders. life's good and back on track.

"my whole life. my regrets as a 46 year old, and advice to others at a crossroad. tifu. more like more whole life really.

hi, i my name's john. i've been lurking for a while, but i've finally made an account to post this. i need to get my life off my chest.  about me. i'm a 46 year old banker and i have been living my whole life the opposite of how i wanted. all my dreams, my passion, gone. in a steady 9-7 job. 6 days a week. for 26 years. i repeatedly chose the safe path for everything, which eventually changed who i was.

today i found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years. my son feels nothing for me. i realised i missed my father's funeral for nothing. i didn't complete my novel, travelling the world, helping the homeless. all these things i thought i knew to be a certainty about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties. if my younger self had met me today, i would have punched myself in the face. i'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon.

let's start with a description of me when i was 20. it seemed only yesterday when i was sure i was going to change the world. people loved me, and i loved people. i was innovative, creative, spontaneous, risk-taking and great with people. i had two dreams. the first, was writing a utopic/dystopic book. the second, was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless.
i had been dating my wife for four years by then. young love. she loved my spontaneity, my energy, my ability to make people laugh and feel loved. i knew my book was going to change the world. i would show the perspective of the 'bad' and the 'twisted', showing my viewers that everybody thinks differently, that people never think what the do is wrong. i was 70 pages through when i was 20. i am still 70 pages in, at 46. by 20, i had backpacking around new zealand and the phillipines. i planned to do all of asia, then europe, then america (i live in australia by the way). to date, i have only been to new zealand and the phillipines.

now, we get to where it all went wrong. my biggest regrets. i was 20. i was the only child. i needed to be stable. i needed to take that graduate job, which would dictate my whole life. to devote my entire life in a 9-7 job. what was i thinking? how could i live, when the job was my life? after coming home, i would eat dinner, prepare my work for the following day, and sleep at 10pm, to wake up at 6am the following day. god, i can't remember the last time i've made love to my wife.

yesterday, my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years. 10 years. that seems like a long time, but i can't comprehend it. it doesn't even hurt. she says it's because i've changed. i'm not the person i was. what have i been doing in the last 10 years? outside of work, i really can't say anything. not being a proper husband. not being me. who am i? what happened to me? i didn't even ask for a divorce, or yell at her, or cry. i felt nothing. now i can feel a tear as i write this. but not because my wife has been cheating on me, but because i am now realising i have been dying inside. what happened to that fun-loving, risk-taking, energetic person that was me, hungering to change the world? i remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school, but declining her for my now-wife. god, i was really popular with the girls in high school. in university/college too. but i stayed loyal. i didn't explore. i studied everyday. 

remember all that backpacking and book-writing i told you about? that was all in the first few years of college. i worked part-time and splurged all that i had earned. now, i save every penny. i don't remember a time i spend anything on anything fun. on anything for myself. what do i even want now?

my father passed ten years ago. i remember getting calls from mom, telling me he was getting sicker and sicker. i was getting busier and busier, on the verge of a big promotion. i kept putting my visit off, hoping in my mind he would hold on. he died, and i got my promotion. i haven't seen him in 15 years. when he died, i told myself it didn't matter what i didn't see him. being an atheist, i rationalized that being dead, it wouldn't matter anyway. what was i thinking? rationalizing everything, making excuses to put things off. excuses. procrastination. it all leads to one thing, nothing. i rationalized that financial security was the most important thing. i now know, that it definitely is not.
i regret doing nothing with my energy, when i had it. my passions. my youth. i regret letting my job take over my life. i regret being an awful husband, a money-making machine. i regret not finishing my novel, not travelling the world. not being emotionally there for my son. being a damn emotionless wallet.

if you're reading this, and you have a whole life ahead of you, please. don't procrastinate. don't leave your dreams for later. relish in your energy, your passions. don't stay on the internet with all your spare time (unless your passion needs it). please, do something with your life while your young. do not settle down at 20. do not forget your friends, your family. yourself. do not waste your life. your ambitions. like i did mine. do not be like me.

sorry for the long post, just had to get it out there.

tl:dr i realised i let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when i was younger, and now i am dead inside, old and tired.





edit: i am quite overwhelmed at the response, thank you for your time. i had posted on a whim, and did not expect the reception.

in regards to my post, i must admit i was quite emotional at the time. as i read what i had written earlier, i can't stop myself from noticing an abundance of spelling and grammatical mistakes, phrases that i would not usually say. i don't think i have used capital locks so much in my life. 
however i will not edit them. that would not do it justice.

i have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions. i will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life, reddit and humanity in general. the amount of encouragement and humour persists to amaze me. despite my situation, i even found myself laughing at a few of the comments.

what my plans are.
i am planning to cut down my hours substantially. i will take a new job if i have to, as i am relatively well-off. i am going to talk to my wife. divorce is currently not what i have in mind and i hope that our communication and relationship will improve. if it doesn't, then so be it. we will both move on. i see there are quite a number of negative comments about her, however i am going to have to say in her defence, she really is a lovely person. she is smart, empathetic and has a great sense of humour. i'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did, but she's not an evil person. i know that. we were both in the fault. we let communication dwindle, and with it, our relationship. there is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money. a steady balance of emotional connection, love and finance is what i will strive to give.

my son. i don't any anything about him. i really don't. i have unknowingly distanced myself from him; i only see him around dinner time. i do not recall having a proper conversation with him, it's quite preposterous now that i think about it. i'm not exactly sure how i'll start bonding with him, i have become quite a boring person. however, i plan to change that. i refuse to be a poor role model. i will ensure that he does not make the same mistake i did with my family. i have decided i am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on saturdays. i never have, due to work, but i will ensure that i do. perhaps i will even play video games with him. there was a time i had a collection of snes games, and i wasn't half bad either. who knows, i might really connect with my son, and it seems to be something he enjoys.

in regards to the novel and travelling, i admit, i am a different person from my youth. i no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel. when i found the long-forgotten 70 pages, the writing was no longer mine. i have changed substantially in 26 years. i am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it. however, i am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring writers that have expressed their passion!
the travelling, i might still do. family trips probably, in the school holidays. maybe with my wife every now and then, if she'd have me. 

i can't turn back time and see my father for a final time, though my mother is still alive. she lives in london, so visits are quite difficult. however, i will make an effort to see her. i do love my parents. i only wish i had not prioritised them as i did.

in regards to the advice i have given. i stand by what i said. live your life. do not procrastinate and let lethargy stop you. however, i might add, avoid living in poverty. i have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or homelessness. i would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be considerable more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards! i believe someone mentioned their dream was financial stability. i say, that is just as valiant as any dream to have. we are all different and are missing different things in our lives, be honest with yourself and you'll know what you really want.
i believe there were arguments upon my language and university/college or what not. i will clarify that, although australians generally call tertiary education 'university' here, i have made small efforts to pertain to americans, as they are the main users, at least i assume. and yes, university/college was free when i attended. i believe australians now are able to attend them relatively free (upfront) and can pay their fees after they graduate.

i believe i have covered the general scope of questions. 

p.s. thank you for the gold, i do appreciate it, but they aren't of real value to me. perhaps if reddit ever includes a re-gifting gold feature, i will gift them to some of the commenters. and yes, please stop sending me gold! i also believe someone tried to even donate to me? i assure you, money is not what i read. please save it for yourself!

i don't think i'll come back to reddit, unless i hear about a way to re-gift gold. i thank you all for your sympathy, your time, and i wish all the best for those in difficult situations. i have faith in your capacity and ability to change, to become happy, to help yourselves. because after all, you're the person in the best position to.
and no, i am not considering religion, i just do not have the correct mindset. i am logical to the point that i cannot, however that is not to say religion isn't bad, it gives people the hope and sense after death which i really do envy.

sincerest of regards,

john.

"letting your dog lick your face, and especially your mouth, is beyond disgusting.. i have a dog, and i never let it lick my face and if it does i quickly go wash that off with soap. dogs eat straight up crap, lick their buttholes ten times a day, pick stuff off the ground, the list goes on.

"given a promotion... and less money?. i could really use reddit's advice this morning...

i started a new job at the beginning of september. i was brought on at a base salary of $70k - with promises of commissions. they estimated my annual compensation to be about $105k but said that it had the potential to go up to around $130k.

at the beginning of november, a man in a similar (but more senior) role turned in his notice. he's a director level, while i'm at a manager level. i was congratulated by my boss for this unexpected promotion and assured that this was a very good move for me and that i'd be making ""a lot more money"". he even referred to it as life changing. i asked if my job title would be changing and he said no.

it took him a few weeks to put my comp plan together. yesterday, he called me in and gave me rave reviews of my performance so far (to be fair, i've mostly been in training) and highlighted some goals for 2020. and then he discussed my exciting new comp plan...

he's cutting my base salary to $60k (which is supposedly what the director's base salary was). and estimating my total compensation to be $104k.  

he acted absolutely flabbergasted that i wasn't excited about it. i told him it was less than he had estimated my previous role - and he said that he had re-ran the math and i would have never gotten close to that in commissions, he had originally run the math based on outdated data. he said that these commissions are basically guaranteed, as in this role, i'll be getting commission based on overall company performance rather than on just my own work. 

i asked him for a night to think about it - and he told me yes, but that it wouldn't change anything. and if i wasn't happy with that, that we could shake hands and go our separate ways. 

i don't know what to do. does anyone have any suggestions? i can't afford to be jobless, but man - this feels like a bait and switch.

update:
i took the director out for drinks. oh boy. apparently he's leaving because they cut his commission by 70% - and told him his new annual compensation estimate was exactly what they've told me mine would be. yikes. i truly appreciate all of the advice and help! it's encouraging when others validate what you're feeling & fearing.",10
"there is a visible difference between not working out at all and doing 15 pushups every day. make 15 push ups your new 'not working out'.. if you do not work out, do 15 pushups every day. it does not sound like much but it makes a huge long term difference to not working out. it does not take long and it makes a visible difference. 
if you struggle with 15, do 10. if 15 make you smile do 20.

edit: because of people messaging/commenting about injury and muscle imbalance: this is not meant to replace your workout routine nor is it meant to be your goto routine for the next 5 years.  
the lpt is meant to be: even a tiny workout can go a long way. warm up. mix it up. but don't think working out only works if you spend 3 days a week in the gym. there is a wide gap between not working out at all and doing 5-10 minutes every day. you can see that difference and you can feel it. some say even a few dong chin ups every other day can go a long way ...",8
"teenagers are old enough to understand the consequences of their actions and cannot be excused from being responsible for them because ""their brain isn't fully developed."". recently, i was reading the comments (on reddit) for an article about the sentencing of a teenager for dropping rocks onto a highway from an overpass. i noticed that some people said that, since the accused were only teenagers, their impulse control areas of their brains hasn't fully developed yet and so they couldn't be held completely responsible for the death of the man who was struck by a rock they dropped (or something similar to those words.)

i come from a country with a very strong family identity, so to imagine a wayward teenager simply ending another person's life doing something clearly and obviously dangerous is inexcusable. it is very easy to see that dropping rocks of an overpass onto oncoming traffic could easily lead to a loss of life, and so a teenager cannot be excused from their actions simply by stating that they are not mature enough or they cannot foresee the consequences of their actions, because, as i have said earlier, it is plain to anybody with an ounce of common sense that doing so can kill someone, a fact most likely obvious to the teenagers who did it (and who probably did it because this could happen.)

edit: to all those saying that teenagers' brains are not yet fully developed and so cannot judge the consequences of their actions, my response to you is this: would you say the same for a 14-year-old who murders or rapes someone? by that age, all children should clearly know what is right and what is wrong especially in terms of actions that can hurt or kill others or themselves.

edit 2: what i'm trying to say is that teenagers know what is right and wrong and know that doing certain things could seriously hurt or kill others or themselves. if they decide to do these things regardless, they should be punished in a way that reflects their intentions.",6

"texas i am a felon. i was hired through a ""temp agency"" that helps people find jobs. i let them know that i had a felony upfront. worked for a warehouse, was offered a permanent position. signed an ""offer of employment letter"" then was fired because of my record after the 2nd background check.. as the title says. i am a felon. {less than a gram charge in 2013-i was a 22yr old punk...} i am now a 28 year old man, and that life is long behind me. i paid the piper in full for it all and have been deeply humbled.

with that being said, i was completely honest with the agency with my record, i made sure they knew this. 100%

this job finally stuck. it was a performance numbers based job. i received electronics and entered information into a computer. you were suppose to scan 8-10 items an hour with a certain error rate.

i always made my numbers. was even one of the top ""receivers"" on the floor. i averaged 120-150ish scans a day, my error rate was very low maybe 3 ""tags""(errors) in total. because i wanted to prove my worth.

i was never late. never called in. came to work and produced. 

my manager was even a family friend that got me the job. he knows my whole history. 

the only reason i posted this was because my old man called me up and said he spoke to his friend who is a really smart 22yr veteran of the military. (so is my pops) about my situation. the friend mentioned to my old man that it sounded like ""discrimination"" and i should see a lawyer.

i signed the offer of employment and when they did the 2nd background check i received a call from the temp agency saying they were no longer going to hire me citing my record. even though i was upfront with my record.

do i have any kind of legs here? or is this just what i should expect until i can get my record expunged? 

kinda shitty man. this job was the best thing that happened to me... i was able to help my mom out and feel like a normal person of society. idk. i don't want any boo hoo's for me. i know i'm a good person.

i felt wronged in this situation, dirty almost. i understand if i provided  them with reasons like being late, or not performing. but i knew i had something to prove and i did just that. which is why they offered me the position.

i was in that warehouse for 3 months... there background check went back 7 years....

this really set me back financially and honestly my manhood was defeated a bit, but that's life.


is there anything here for me to pursue? 

thanks to anyone that can help. have lovely day everyone!

edit: should i speak to a lawyer i guess is the question. sorry for the wall of text.

edit 2: wow thanks so much for all the replies. i appreciate it all. i'm going to go through and reply now. i am grateful for all the knowledge.

edit 3: someone gave this gold! wow! thanks kind stranger. i can't reply anymore due to the locked thread, but thanks to everyone that has messaged me with the awesome advice,stories, and positive affirmation. some of you brought a tear to my eye with some things that were said. i'm getting a bit teary eyed now to be honest. i was very hesitant to put my story here, but i knew good people would show up. thanks so much to all of you guys, even the ones being mean. you guys really made my day today. i don't deserve this. i hope others can find some kind of hope and positivity through this. thanks everyone!",2

she constantly vents to me about me and about how he doesn't treat her half as good as he treated me and she doesn't understand it. i feel terrible but there is nothing i can do, i don't understand it either. i've always been aware he had a hard time getting over me but i guess a couple hours ago he called her by my name during sex. she blew up my phone about it and somehow took it out on me. reminder; i haven't spoken to him outside of when i'm with both of them together in a year!!! 
he has called her by my name before but it's always been brushed off as a simple mistake. 
she insists we cannot be friends and i tried to apologize even though all of this is out of my control.
advice??


update: after going through all of your comments (yes i read all of them) i feel there is some stuff to clear up. she asked me for permission to date him and i gave her the go ahead which is why him and i distanced. it was a mutual agreement, he also said that it would be best if we distanced for her sake. our interactions are minimal at get togethers or whenever i go to see her because they live together. he has never been flirty or creepy towards me so i do believe it's an honest mistake. as for the comments that state that i ""am clearly not over him"" that relationship died years ago and i am with somebody happily. i want to take your advice and just ""drop them"" but this is years of friendship i want to save...

update #2: first of all thank you guys so much for the replies and help, you guys have, if anything, reassured me i did nothing wrong. i was not too sure before. i am also aware that this may not be a friendship worth saving as she has always been this way, always had to be right and i have always put in more effort. however, i do not mean to make this about something else but after high school i have been left with 2 friends, one of which was her. it's hard to think about my life being more empty than it already is and i feel like every single year i have less and less people in my life even though i am trying so hard to keep them around. i have been there for her and friends with her for 10 years and never through her fuckups even thought about ending the friendship. i'm just left wondering, once again, what it is about me that made everyone disappear after high school. again, sorry if i'm turning this into something else. it's not my intention but the need to save the friendship is deeper than just ""oh i just want to be friends""",7
"ex-landlord trying to move people into our old apartment while we're still paying rent on it, and keep our deposit. i live in denver, co for reference.

&#x200b;

my wife and i recently signed a lease on a new apartment. we have paid rent on the old apartment up until january 31st so we are not fully moved out yet. we still have some belongings at the old place and haven't finished cleaning it. our lease ends on feb 1st. we told our landowner we would be moving around january 8th, so that he would have time to find a new tenant. i already told him that if he wanted someone to move in before the end of january he would have to give us the pro-rata rent for the rest of the month, and give us enough notice to fully move out, and he agreed. i just got a voicemail from him telling me he has someone moving into our old place in three hours and that they're not refunding our deposit because the blinds are dirty and the garden needs weeding (both things we were going to do before the end of the month of course). our deposit was $1200. to really rub salt in the wound, the place was a shitheap when we moved in and we made many improvements to it at our own cost, such as fixing broken windows, repainting dirty walls, replacing broken fixtures etc. we have lived there for 2 years and he has consistently told us what excellent tenants we are and how much he appreciates the care we take of the property.

update: thanks for your advice everyone! i decided to go the old fashioned route, and told his wife. she said we should ignore him completely, that they would pay someone to clean and weed, and is bringing us our full deposit check and pro rata rent for the rest of the month this evening. who runs the world?",2

"people who commit suicide by jumping in front of trains/buses/cars etc are the worst type of asshole.. suicide is a real issue. it's a worldwide issue. people kill themselves for many different reasons and it's tragic.

my heart goes out to the people suffering so badly they want it all to end. my heart goes out to their families and friends. 

but if you jump in front of a train (or any vehicle driven by others) to end it all you're a piece of shit. 

you want to kill yourself that's your business. i wish you didn't feel you had to and i wish you felt you could get help. but don't completely fuck up others lives! how dare you destroy the life of the innocent drivers and lives of their passengers for your selfish desire to end your own!

end of the day you don't care. you're dead. the living have to try and put their lives together and go on. you don't.

but fuck you. asshole.

edited to fix spelling.

edit to add:

i didn't expect this to blow up like it did.

to those people saying i don't know what it's like to be suicidal or i'm underestimating the pain,
i don't underestimate. i've been there.

i'm not saying people who kill themselves in this manner are  annoying me persay, i'm saying their actions by killing themselves in that manner can potentially fuck up the lives of strangers. innocent people like the bus driver just doing his job. the kid going to school. the person struggling with their own mental demons. 

how is that not selfish?

how is that not wrong?

it's terrible when people feel they need to end it all. some, like me, get help or pull themselves through it. some don't and that's tragic. 

but yes i get upset when innocents suffer because of the actions of one. i've seen it too many times not to get upset. 

so i make no apologies for my opinion other than to say perhaps the aggression and swearing could have been worded better and still got the point across. 

if you choose to think i'm an asshole well that's ok. thank you all for your comments good and bad. it's certainly made me think reading them and has opened my eyes.

if you are struggling yourself i wish you all the best. the world is better with you in it.",6

"i'm a peeping tom but instead of watching i listen and do the deed during.   

i live in a basement of someone's house cause they're family owns apartments and so this guy made his basement into a nice studio loft. my landlord is same age and gender as me (late 20's male). i like to use porn to masturbate but there is something about hearing/seeing people have sex in real life that really gets me off. my landlords girlfriend is a definite moaner and i've always loved women who moan during sex. i realized i could hear them if i didn't make any noise and i thought it was pretty hot; it would get me in the mood and i would use porn to finish myself off. 

anyways, to why i made this post. i discovered that the closer i was to the vents, the better i could hear them. i have a vent in the closet that is the biggest one down here, maybe it's the main outflow for when the heater/ac goes on? whatever, point is, i can stand on a stool and put by ear up to the vent (it's about 7ish ft high) and listen to every moan, breath, and ball slap that goes on and i think it's so fucking hot. my landlord and his girlfriend are pretty attractive people it's not like i have to pretend they are someone else while listening either.

i feel like a trained dog because whenever i think i hear a moan, i rush over to the closet, get on the stool, dick-in-hand and put my ear up to the vent, hoping to get some audio porn. half the time it's a false alarm, but when it isn't, it's so hot and i proceed to have a great orgasm. 

so another lesser confession would be that one time i heard what sounded like moans and so habit kicked in. stand on stool, dick out, ear to vent, proceed to masturbate. half-way through i realize it's the girlfriend crying and making moaning sounds, not sex-moaning sounds. i almost shot my load off to a woman crying by herself at midnight. fuck that was weird. fuck i'm a weirdo for even getting half-way there.",11

"updatei'm feeling a lot of anger about this childm5 of mym39 wife'sf39 affair that i've been talked into being a father figure for.. first post(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cctm2u/im_feeling_a_lot_of_anger_about_this_childm5_of/)

hey everyone it's been a few weeks since you heard from me. i guess i'm kind of in a spot to update now.

so, my post got a lot of feedback and it was *pretty much* unanimous. i heard from lots of people; parents and sons and daughters in blended families, people who'd been cheated on themselves, people who were max in their own families and you all told me what i should have been able to admit myself, that this was not normal, that no one had ever heard of an arrangement like this.

i resolved to end the arrangement and met with my ex wife and her partner to tell them a few days after i posted, midway through their custody week. many people advised me to speak to my boys about it first, like my ex did to me, but i wanted to deliver the message before having to take max again. i was thinking that it might be better to instead call them out on that behaviour and try to get them to agree not to include the boys in that level of discussion before me, and then we could all sit down with the boys.

the meeting did not go well. they were both pretty mad at me. i had tried to prepare for it to be uncomfortable. i told myself just to be polite and firm, that i didn't owe them an explanations beyond ""i'm sorry, its not working out"". i guess he had made some career move based on this schedule that i was fucking up. in hindsight i do feel sort of responsible for that frustration, in that i regret agreeing to this arrangement in the first place, but in the moment i really was not giving a fuck about this man's work life balance. then, he said something about how i wasn't being ""fair"", that they just wanted a ""fair"" custody arrangement. that made me very mad. thinking about this all to type it out has my heart hammering. i have some different opinions on ""fairness"". i said some pretty shitty, regrettable things to both of them and then we were all screaming at each other for awhile and then i stormed out and i didn't talk to the boys.

i didn't get to talk to my boys for several days until hand off. they immediately were asking about why max wasn't with them and i, prepared for it, held a more serious talk with them than i had up to this point. i talked about how its great that they enjoy spending time with max, but that i'm their father and that max has his own father to spend time with. i also talked about how this whole spectacle of our lives is difficult for me, that i don't like having to spend only every other week with them. that their mother's decision to start another family with max's father and max still makes me sad. this is pretty awfully difficult stuff to talk about. i've been pretty strict with myself about not venting to my son's about their mother up until now, but effectively that's meant i haven't really talked about her or our breakup at all. if you can't say anything nice, as they say.

trying to maintain that respect for their mother and also talk frankly about my own feelings is a difficult tightrope balance. i don't want to blame their mother, but i also don't want to *not* blame their mother, if you know what i mean. this would be one of the situations i identify as ""unfair"", where the responsible thing is to never say anything disparaging or ""poisonous"" to my sons about their mother, my ex, but that means i have to describe the current state of affairs and what has happened to get here in a way that isn't disparaging to their mother and act like this is normal. ""she decided"".

i think i actually did a good job navigating the conversation. my sons absorbed it easier than i expected. a few weeks later and things with them are basically normal. 

i have had a few short conversations with my ex since our big embarrassing blowup. i sort of feel like i want her to apologize for this whole thing, but also know that i'm not doing myself any favours waiting for that to happen. i think she remains upset with me, more for the things i said than the rejection of this arrangement with max. or maybe that's just projection, because that's what i feel guilty for. i also regret that the last time i spoke to max was dropping him off before ending the arrangement. i don't know. i guess his mom has explained to him that she missed him too much, to have him gone each week, but i don't know how sturdy that story will be.

rereading my last post has me feeling pretty shameful of how i talked about max. i know he doesn't deserve my sustained ire and that he's not going anywhere, so i'll have to be able to adjust to his presence. i'm obviously holding on to a lot of anger that is really about my ex wife but she isn't obligated to give a shit about that and i am obligated to interact with her politely so i guess that anger just got set aside and then vented onto max just because he was there in my face, but that was my own fault.

so, i sort of expect things will pretty much return to normal from here. contact with my ex is curt right now, but that'll loosen up.

"my wife's mother tickles our son inappropriately and my wife defends her - help?. hi everyone. i am a 35m married to a 27f. 

we have a 2 year old son. ever since i can remember, my wife's mother has tickled him. usually in normal places but also in places where it shouldn't be okay to tickle someone. 

i recently read something that women can actually be child molesters too but it's often overlooked because people give them more leeway and ignore all the signs.

and when i thought about it, i realized that exactly described this scenario. if this were her father or my own father then this would definitely not be tolerated ever!

but the fact that it's my mother in law... who is mother to... my wife... makes it complicated.

i recently called me wife out on it for the nth time and she came back with ""you have a sick mind to think that my mom would ever molest a child - in fact youre the deranged one because you're sexualizing it!""

i actually felt guilty because i felt like maybe i was the one viewing it that way and maybe it is my fault for seeing something that's not there and overreacting.

while my son doesn't seem to have a problem with it, i wonder what example that it's setting for him about boundaries and touching. what if he starts tickling other boys or even girls down there because he learned it from her?

what happens if it progresses into more?

idk what to do and i'm honestly hurt that my wife is trying to gaslight me about my concerns.",7

"by peeing all over my first kiss and immediately legging it. not today, about 9 years ago. this story is one that stills keeps me awake at night begging for death.

**backstory**

i was 15, just an awkward high schooler from the suburbs of melbourne. i wasn't popular by any means, but i had a few good mates and while none of us had a girlfriend, we were always full of bullshit stories about our sexual conquests. ""oh, she's from another school you don't know her"", ""it was on holiday"", ""and then her friend joined in"", etc. between us we must have fucked half the female population of australia before hitting 16. but in reality all of us probably would have killed each other if it meant a shot at ditching the v plates.

anyway, as the school year's finishing up and everyone's gearing up for summer, there's talk about some of the popular kids heading out of town on a bit of a camping trip, out on this king-of-the-jocks types cousins farm. everyone wanted in. a big piss up away from adults filled with the hottest girls from our year? come on. if us boys could score an invite we'd finally be able to prove to each other just how much game we had.

i wasn't so naive as to actually bother asking for an invite. there was no chance of us getting a look in, we simply did not have that kind of status. but then, on the first day of the summer break, one of the guys hits me up with a text; ""we're in, pack your shit."" fortunately for us, his much cooler sister from the year below ours had been immediately invited, and through the age old art of sibling blackmail, he'd wrestled the details out of her. it wasn't an invite per se, but we knew where to go and i doubt we rated high enough to even bother asking to leave.

due to the nature of the impending debauchery, we had absolutely no interest in our parents catching on to the vibe of the trip and decided to get ourselves there. an hour and a half on the train out of town, a bus ride and about a thirty minute walk later we arrive at the campsite. it wasn't really a farm, it was just this massive property that made money as a sort of backup scout camp most of the year, but the owner was letting us have it for the weekend while it was empty.

we shouldn't have worried about not getting an invite, it seemed like half the year level had rocked up. looking back i honestly have no idea how a group of 14-16 year olds got their hands on as much alcohol as they did but this thing was **stocked**. we were on some *project x* shit, a whole bunch of sex crazy teenagers out in the sticks drinking themselves stupid. this was my first experience properly drinking, and despite my apparent long list of sexual conquests, my first time really hanging out with girls.



**the pissening**

one of the great things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down social barriers and make you realise that most people are actually pretty cool once they drop the act. one of the terrible things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down urinal barriers and make you realise that no matter how recently you took a piss, you're gonna be busting for another in no time.

for example, late into the evening, i found myself sitting on a log, alone with a girl i'd never have had to balls to speak to before. a classic popular high school girl, way out of my league. but here we were, her downing vodka from the bottle, me sinking tinnies (of sweet, sugary, girly cider).

things get a little blurry, but i remember getting increasingly closer and closer until we were making out. we were pretty awkwardly positioned on this log, and in an attempt to disguise my own overly excited log i was sort of leaning forward with my arm tucked into my stomach. my elbow was pushing up hard against my bladder. i suddenly became aware of a desperate need to pee, but i wasn't gonna be a fucking idiot by ending this action to get up and go empty the tank. i needed to be stoic. i could pee when i'm dead.

my unwelcome rock hard guest was at this point making a pretty good go of trying to break free from my pants, and this girl could tell. to my teenage delight, rather than retracting in horror she didn't seem to mind and decided to work with it. unzip. pull free. spit in the hand. she knew what she was doing. but the unrelenting excitement that should have been my first handjob became sheer panic as i felt the flood gates reaching breaking point. within milliseconds, the thought left my brain and travelled south.

before the words ""oh shit stop"" could leave my mouth i became a human super soaker, releasing a veritable niagara falls skyward into the small space between us. by the time she'd pulled away in drunken horror, my liquid fury was all over both of us. her face was contorted into a mixture of confusion and rage, and before either one of us says anything i'm on my feet running for the hills, attempting to tuck my still flowing hose away. she's yelling after me, ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"", as people look over at the chaos.

after hiding away in my tent for a short time, king-of-the-jocks less than politely told me that it was time for me to leave and to take my guys with me. they were not impressed. i called my dad to come and pick us up at two in the morning. he was not impressed. as for the girl? the reputation that followed me around school for the following three years makes me think that she was, in fact, not impressed. 

**tl;dr** things were getting a little wild post my first make out sesh with a hot girl, but after foolishly ignoring my bladder liquid gold rained down on the both of us and i ran like the wind. got myself and my mates kicked out of the party of the year, and had my dad drive an hour and a half out at 2am to pick us up.

edit: thanks for my first ever (non liquid) gold!

edit 2: to all those asking about my ability to take a piss while standing to attention, i dunno what to tell you. is it a super power? am i broken? we may never know. but i can safely say that i don't partake often due to urine related ptsd.

"my dad (52m) has been inappropriate with me (18f).. i live with my mom, dad and a younger sister. my dad is usually home for 5 months during which he has a break before taking up projects the rest of the year. 

 i turned 18 last year, he's been at home for 2 months now. i have a room of my own, my sister chooses to sleep with me at times and sometimes with my parents. i usually sleep without locking my door. about a month and a half ago, my dad enters my room at around 2 am in the morning, waking me up asking for sexual favors. i'm usually a deep sleeper and this woke me right up, was traumatizing - i immediately screamed at him, asking him to go away from my room locking the door in the process. i couldn't sleep the entire night, the morning was only worse - though i never feared going to the table for breakfast, he behaved as though everything was normal. my mom only knows there was an issue back then, but doesn't know the details. 

&#x200b;

i have been locking my door ever since that day. over the course of 2 months, this has repeated 3 times now - having him knock the door, waking me up. i only opened it the first time, asking him never to do it again nor enter my room. the other times, i only was left wide awake and never did open the door. i never could sleep properly ever since and always check under the door to see who it is.

&#x200b;

early this morning, my sister had an event to attend to and she woke up early, knocked the door. after confirming it was her (half asleep), i let her in in order for her to take her clothes and leave with mom. my sleep cycles are bad, my health isn't in good shape though i do try my best to keep fit. i fall asleep, without the door locked. i'm woken up by dad - touching me inappropriately, forcing me down and asking me to co-operate. i used to exercise earlier and am quite strong physically so i could forcibly get myself away. i was trembling, my mind unable to process anything - all i could do was to scream at him and lock the door behind him. 

&#x200b;

he crossed a line i was hoping i could prevent and i feel rotten inside. i can't seem to get it out of my head. my dad has always served to be an inspiration for me - i always used to look up to him and this ruins a lot of things for me. i feel helpless. i never got to spend much time with dad and wasn't closer to mom than i was with him because of the time he spent away. i used to look forward to time with him and now i just wish he were gone. 

&#x200b;

distance never really helped with our relationship with dad. mom and dad were on the verge of splitting up for the same.  but he means the world to her. no one else including us sisters could ever giver her anything like how she enjoys her time with him. he makes her the happiest and how she treasures him is special. she hasn't been working for quite some time now. the sole source of income is from dad. 

it would be selfish of me to break it to mom. it would break her and i don't wish for that to happen. dad being the only source of income would mean if i ever broke it to mom and they decided to split - my sister's (13) education would be at a stake and we could never be able to live the way we do. i have friends, cousins i know i can rely on - (though none of them know) but mom's usually at home and fin's comfort only with dad. i find myself cornered, and can't really seem to find hope in anything. i feel broken and devastated. my true sense of inspiration is destroyed. 

things could probably never be the same again. i just hope there's a way out - one in which neither mom nor my sister would have to face the brunt because of me. i have thought it over, and i don't think it would get better wrt dad until i could do something about it - however selfish it may be.  the only way out is i see is to wait until the end of three more months. i'm halfway there perhaps.

"by getting my tonsils removed. i like many people in adulthood have had to deal with the annoyance of overgrown tonsils. from the 3 – 4 times a year tonsillitis, to the sleep apnoea that they cause. personally, i wanted my tonsils gone.

after getting tonsillitis for the second time this year i decided enough is enough, i booked an appointment with my gp, referred to the surgeon and made a date for the surgery.

i was warned that i was in for the sorest through of my life and that it was going to be agony for a while. which was ok, how bad could it be?

day 1: i was prepped and ready to go, surprisingly not too nervous for my first major surgery. the procedure went well, my tonsils were gone and i was all set to recover in hospital. the pain wasn't too high yet, i was still spaced out from the drugs, so all in all the first night was quite easy.

day 2:

4am: i woke up needing to go to the bathroom, i felt like i needed to spit so i rushed over to the bathroom sink. i spat out a few mouthfuls of blood not thinking too much of it. i slowly shuffled back to my bed and quickly fell back asleep.

7:30am: this time i awoke to a lot of pain, i buzzed the nurse to get my dose of endone and panadol. i mentioned to her that i had bled a little overnight. she was immediately concerned, she passed me a plastic cup and told me to spit all the blood that comes up from now.

(i thought that leaking blood would be common as it was when i got my wisdom teeth out.)

for the next few hours slowly but surely i was filling up this cup that looked more and more like red wine. it was horrible because the pain was quite high regardless of the pain killers, i couldn't lie down an rest as the blood would go in to my stomach.

10pm: the nurses tried to use an ice pack on my neck and give me countless icy poles to freeze the blood but nothing was working, i had filled almost two cups now and they decided it was time to call my surgeon.
they broke the bad news to me and told me i needed to be prepped for surgery again. i was surprisingly ok with it. i remained calm and collected. i went through the procedure again of getting countless needles and being sedated. (fun!)

post second surgery: i was back where i was today but hopefully no more bleeding! the surgeon informed me that a blood vessel had haemorrhaged around my tonsil area causing blood to leak. i had to have blood sucked out of my stomach because i had indeed swallowed quite a bit of blood.

he told me that this complication only happens once a year for him! (lucky me.)

day 3-4:

the recovery was brutal and painful, i was in bed all day, struggling to get any solids down as the pain was too bad to swallow. however, no complications.

day 5:
for anyone who has had the pleasure of having a tonsillectomy you would know the most painful part about it is waking up from a snooze.

i learnt that the best thing to do is get up, drink some water and have some meds asap!

i was getting out of the shower when i felt a large amount of liquid in my mouth, i leaned over the sink and spat out blood.

here is a picture of the sink: https://m.imgur.com/kpxtomf

my mum, who had been amazing throughout this whole thing, was luckily around the corner from my home when this happened. so i called her and we decided the safest bet would be returning to hospital.

i felt very unwell in the car ride, and i was pale as a ghost. they quickly put an iv in and gave me fluids.

after a very long wait we were advised by my surgeon to return home and come back in if it were to happen again.

i returned home and rested up for a few hours, it was around 9pm when i felt the same liquid taste in the back of my throat. this time i knew. i rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to cough up blood.

here's a photo of this time: http://imgur.com/s2yfx39

as you can see, it's a lot more this time around.

i don't know if you have ever had the displeasure of coughing up blood but the worst part about it is just how sticky blood is. it sticks to your tongue, throat and lips, resulting in blood clots getting stuck in your mouth. it's horrible.

i called my mum and she rushed over to come get me.

back to hospital again and another iv :)

i was admitted back to the ward and i stayed overnight, my night wasn't overly dramatic. i bled once around 3-4am but it only lasted 5 minutes so there wasn't much for concern.

day 6!!!!

things were looking ok, i was still in a lot of pain but i had not bled outside of the little one in the morning.

1pm: i was watching shitty daytime tv as i reached to have a sip of water, i felt that same feeling in my throat come on and it felt heavy quick.

i had no time to react so i grabbed the smoothie cup i had received from my mum and proceeded to spit mouthfuls of blood in to it. i was trying to get a hold of my buzzer to notify the nurse.

they came in shortly after and rushed to get me a vomit bag, it was coming fast. the nurses were trying to keep me calm and they again put an ice pack behind my neck to try and slow down the bleeding. i kept coughing it up. i started making gagging noises as the blood was sticking and clotting around my throat.

i started to feel light headed. within seconds of saying that, i fainted.

i woke up seconds later to the ward now being in code blue, i had never seen so many nurses and doctors in one room so fast. there must have been 15-20 people in this small room. i had needles going in to my arms, an oxygen mask being put on, and multiple nurses and doctors talking to me.

""raph, stay with us.""

""raph, look at me, keep your eyes open.""

this was the first time in my life that i was genuinely scared for my life.

i could overhear that they were trying to get a hold of my surgeon, because once again i needed emergency surgery.

i was rushed into theatre and they prepped me again. giving me another iv there was a delay because my surgeon was finishing up surgery for another patient at another hospital.

it was at this moment where i broke down crying. i felt so sick, all i could taste was blood, i was scared, alone. i didn't know what was going to happen to me. all the while i was still coughing up a lot of blood.

after some time had passed, the nurse with me was starting to panic.

""we need to get him into theatre now!""

they kept trying to give me oxygen but i kept coughing blood into the mask.

my surgeon arrived and i was put to sleep.

i woke up in unbearable pain and agony, it was the worst pain i had felt since this whole thing began. but that quickly changed when i was given morphine.

i rested up and was eventually moved back into the ward and i was greeted by my mum and nan. my poor mother had been through hell. she had only just before it all went down. she was bawling her eyes out the whole time i was going through it all, blaming herself for leaving :(

day 7:

i got a big sleep and i woke up to my surgeon checking in on me. he was truly sorry for my ordeal, and said i was the worst he had ever seen.

the cause was the same as last time, a vessel had opened up and caused the bleeding.

all in all i lost 800ml of blood from that ordeal. that's almost a fifth of total blood!

it's crazy to think that if i wasn't in the ward when it happened there was a good chance i could have died.

day 8-9:

i stayed in hospital. everyone agreed that it was the best place for me, just in case thunder struck three times.

i was pretty shook on day 8 still, but as soon as word got out that it went from standard procedure to almost fatal i was receiving a lot of love from my family and friends.

twitch kept me sane throughout my stay. all my streaming buddies reached out and wished me well which all contributed to making me feel better.

day 10:

i am typing to you all from my phone! this is probably the longest thread i have ever written on reddit and i don't normally post much but i wanted to share my story because this will stick with me for the rest of my life.

each day i'm feeling more and more strong. my pain still sucks but it's getting less severe and i haven't bled since! i'm out of hospital being taken very well taken care of by my mother.

as cliche as it sounds, this whole experience made me very grateful not only for my life, but more importantly the doctors, nurses, surgeons, paramedics etc. that go through so much stress to help us fellow humans live the lives we live.

i can't wait to be back in full health and hopefully i can play some games and get some streams in before i go back to work! ;)

tl;dr: i got the procedure of getting my tonsils out. unfortunately due to complications i needed multiple emergency surgeries. after a few days of rest from the second procedure, i started to bleed excessively. which quickly made me faint turning the hospital into a code red state. i lost a significant amount of blood and i was prepped for a third and final procedure that saved my life.

edit: a small amount of you requested my twitch, here it is: twitch.tv/wristyplum :)

thankyou so much for all the kind words. i really did not expect this to blow up as it has. y'all are so nice!

edit 2: you guys have asked for an update so here it is:

i'm feeling so much better, the pain is no where near as bad! today was the first day i woke up and didn't straight away need painkillers, i'm able to eat whole meals with a side of water to help wash it down. 

my happiness is so high due to the fact that i'm feeling more and more like me again not this zonked out zombie!

i still can't believe how many people this post has affected. my intentions were never for it to go ""viral"" i just wanted to tell my story mostly for me, when it was still fresh in my mind. i could express myself and always look back on this moment in life, but now because of everyone's support and love i'll look back on it in ways i could never imagined!",4

"by misunderstanding the ugly duckling. the other night, i was out getting a drink with some friends from university, and for some reason or another, the conversation turned to swans.

now, as a kid, i remember reading the ugly duckling - and for some reason, i completely misunderstood it. not the lesson of the story or anything, but the reason that the duckling was ugly in the first place. the reason being that it was, of course, a swan.

but for some reason, i got a few wires crossed, and thought it was in fact a duckling like the rest. instead of thinking that the swan was a different kind of bird, i thought that swans were just male ducks. for some reason i never stopped thinking it, even though i've seen plenty of ducks, and literally had the differences between male and female ones pointed out to me before. i don't know why it never got through to me. i guess i just thought they were different kinds of duck or something.

what this means is that when one of my friends mentioned something about female swans, i scoffed and very loudly proclaimed that ""you can't have female swans"". i stuck by this, convinced they were fucking with me, until they realised i wasn't kidding.

and that's how i, at the age of 19, finally learned that female swans exist. my friends won't stop laughing at me over it, and i really have no defence other than it made sense at the time.

tl;dr i didn't think swans could be female, my friends won't let me live it down.",4

"just because you have a budget, doesn't mean you have to spend all of your budget. i noticed some posts on here recently about people feeling guilty about spending money, even though they can afford it and have budgeted for it, since it's hard for them to get out of the ""frugal"" mindset. the general response seemed to be that they should learn to accept that it's okay to spend money on some things—that's what setting a budget is for, after all. 

while this is great advice, i seem to have the opposite problem of these people—i am a bit *too* okay with spending money. i have a set amount of ""fun"" funds that i set aside every paycheck, but because i'm lucky enough to not have anything i really need to save up for, every so often my fun funds will pile up and i'll find myself looking for things to spend my money on—because heck, i've already budgeted for this, so it should be alright, right? but the thing is, i don't really *need* these things, and sometimes don't even want them that much to begin with; i'm literally just looking for an excuse to waste money. it actually got kind of stressful because i wanted to ""make the most"" of my budget but had nowhere to spend it (sounds crazy, right?). a few months ago i spent almost $3000 on an instrument that i've played maybe twice since then. looking back, did i need to spend that $3000? probably not. i could've put that money in the s&p500 or something instead and made $300, and i probably would've gotten more enjoyment out of seeing my portfolio go up $300 than i got from playing that instrument twice.

so i guess learning to be okay with spending money can be a double-edged sword. if you're someone like me who might spring for the next ""upgrade"" just because you can afford it, even though it's more than you need and isn't as good a value, it might be helpful to take a step back and consider whether or not that upgrade is really worth it. since coming to that conclusion, i've cut back my wasteful spending considerably, and the stress of not ""making the most"" of my budget is gone.

"if fevers are the immune system's response to viral/bacterial infection, why do with try to reduce them? is there a benefit to letting a fever run its course vs medicinal treatment?. it's my understanding that a fever is an autoimmune response to the common cold, flu, etc. by raising the body's internal temperature, it makes it considerably more difficult for the infection to reproduce, and allows the immune system to fight off the disease more efficiently. 

with this in mind, why would a doctor prescribe a medicine that reduces your fever? is this just to make you feel less terrible, or does this actually help fight the infection? it seems (based on my limited understanding) that it would cure you more quickly to just suffer through the fever for a couple days.",9

i know from a friend's past experience that the mother's spouse's name automatically goes on the birth certificate here, whether he's actually the father or not, as long as they're still married on paper. my friend had to go through a paternity test to prove the baby wasn't his, and his lawyer said if the baby's real dad didn't step up that he might still be on the hook for child support. because apparently the state doesn't care who the baby's actual dad is, as long as there's a second party to financially look after the kid. luckily, in my buddy's case, the baby's father went through the process to be recognized as the real dad so my friend could be removed from the birth certificate. my ex says she doesn't know who the dad is. so basically, i think i'm screwed.

"update mother in law suing for visitation in ny.. on mobile. also, this is gonna be a bit long. 

here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aq9o11/mother_in_law_is_suing_for_visitation_ny/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

we went to court for our initial hearing in february. i asked for dismissal citing troxel v. granville. the judge agreed that we were within our rights, however she couldn't grant a dismissal because my mil requested an attorney. the judge advised she didnt qualify for an appointed lawyer so she should seek representation through elder law. my mil begins raising her hands and waving them around asking if she could be allowed to speak. she states in court that me and my wife bully, abuse, belittle, and swear around the children constantly. the first 3 are outright lies and the 4th, so fucking what? she also stated that she never mentioned once being hacked or being obsessed that she was hacked, and that my oldest daughter was the one obsessed with hacking and spying. the judge made no comments and advised her that we weren't keeping her away from the children and that she should seek relief by visiting them under our supervision. 

fast forward to a week before the hearing we have to meet with the kaw guardian for the children. we show the law guardian all the insane conspiracy theory texts and the texts where she accuses me of hacking her phone. she spoke with the children and we took our leave. the paperwork we received stated that my mil showed her a much different conversation. my mil had deleted the texts that made her look bad and copy pasted several from my wife that made my wife look like a bully and that she was harassing my mil. the children outright denied any bullying/abuse and stated to the law guardian that my mil makes them uncomfortable because she is constantly yelling at them, when they want to leave she wont them go and she wont stop talking about who is hacking her. so obviously she supports our position. 

in the hearing my lawyer asked for dismissal, and requested we be paid our legal fees by mil as the petition was brought in bad faith. my mils appointed attorney couldnt withdraw and refile an amended petition because mil wouldnt let her so the judge dismissed and awarded us our legal fees. 

i havent seen the judgement yet but it's my understanding that it was dismissed with prejudice. however my mil doesnt live in reality and is going to file another petition alleging that i've brainwashed my children. i wish that were true, they never listen to me. so i may have another update for you all shortly, but for now i'll enjoy my victory.",2

"by reading my brother's journal. this did actually happen today, as the clock had just barely struck midnight and christmas was upon us. also, this is my throwaway because dammit, i'll not have this following me to my actual account.

i was in the laundry room which doubles as the storage room, where belongings go to die. i saw a book that did not immediately appear to be a journal on one of the shelves, so i grabbed it and flipped it open to the middle. i recognized my younger brother's handwriting and knew i had wandered onto private property, but my eyes lingered a little too long on the page. 

my brother has been out of the house for several years. he deployed to afghanistan and got married when he returned to the states. he's always been a little weird but we (mostly) accept his quirks as just social anxiety and move on. but there i was, in the asscrack of christmas morning holding a journal that he obviously had written during his teenage years. it was one of those journals that ask you questions and you fill in the answers, and of course the question i opened to was ""what's something you hope no one ever finds out about you?""

there, staring at me from the page was the following sentence: ""that i had sex with one of the cows.""

yes, we grew up on a farm. i don't believe he was speaking merely of a corpulent maiden. 

i consider myself open minded, and have prepared myself for various scenarios with my siblings. what if they come out as gay or trans, what if they become addicts, what if they end up in prison, what if they were to join the circus. i have never entertained the possibility of ""what if they romanced the livestock."" life just doesn't prepare you for random bestiality.

"what caused the growing whining sound when old propeller planes went into a nose dive?. i'm assuming it has to do with friction somewhere, as the whine gets higher pitched as the plane picks up speed, but i'm not sure where.

the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a wwii german ju87 stuka dive bomber(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junkers_ju_87). it was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

turns out we associate the sound with any old-school dive-bombers because of hollywood. this kind of makes me think of how we associate the sound of red tailed hawks(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvbxlxyleyq) screeching and calling with the sound of bald eagles (they actually sound like this(https://youtu.be/pq2umauybow?t=35)) thanks to hollywood.

i went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. after getting home, i uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. once the hole was set into place, i expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. once i got a good fit after doing a ""test run"" i found the hairs to be a little too much. i shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. the preparations were made, the mood was set, and i opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.

fast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. all is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. i knew i fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers i had used. aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. i told her i cheated on her with a coconut. .. it took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove i didn't have anyone else over and i simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. she was furious and i tried to console her by saying i'd never cheat on her with anyone..just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. i'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/

tl;dr : fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought i was cheating on her, had to fess up.

"for objecting to 'girls day'?. i'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because i was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when i was young. my two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. 


about 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. originally this was to see one of the magic mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. originally it didn't bother me, because i'm an adult and i have my own life, and my own house, and i really didn't even think about it. but an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. my aunt's birthday was in january and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. so i bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. 


when i asked what was going on for her birthday, i was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. this kind of irked me because when i mentioned i bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. i felt pretty left out since i am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. 


i griped about and was told that i was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. i agree with that, but once again, i'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was i was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when i asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. 

at this point i was very annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so i decided i needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. so i removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my facebook. now my phone is being blown up and i'm being told that i'm immature and i need to grow up. i responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and i'm just going to follow that example.

yes, she had pancreatic cancer but it was early stages. she had surgery to get a tumor removed, and was doing chemotherapy because she had 2 lymph nodes that were infected. she was doing really well, generally tired, but not very many side affects from the chemo. on monday, she went back to work, and she felt really good. tuesday, wednesday, both good. thursday she took off work because that is when she had chemo and she wanted to rest. thursday she was talking to a family friend saying she was just tired and didnt feel very good. thursday she probably should have went to the hospital but didnt. 

3 am: my mother called 911 and told them she couldnt breathe. my grandma heard her and called out to her and she responded to her, and she was laying on the bathroom floor. once the ambulance got there she was unresponsive and they took her to the er and gave her medicine that would help her heart and then they would do cpr. once the medicine wore off, her pulse would stop, they'd give her more meds, and it would last for about 2 minutes. her heart wouldnt beat on its own. they did this cycle about 12 times. they tried 1 last thing, gave her some medicine that is supposed to clear a blood clot, and see if that would help, but it did not. i had to make the decision (as her poa) to stop the machines and let her go. (i was watching them as they did this... and nothing seemed to help)

as the family we decided to do an autopsy because we don't know exactly what caused her death. yes she had cancer, but she said she couldnt breathe. a heart attack? a blood clot? we dont know, and the er doctor did not know. my mother was my best friend, and i really took care of her these last few months, it's hard to see her go the way she did.


hi all, please bare with me. i am all over the place and i would like some guidance on what to do in this type of situation. 
my mother just died unexpectedly yesterday. i have some guidance from family on what to do but i want to see what other people think so i am coming to you. 

my mother owned her house, only 10k left to pay on it. 
she lost her job about 4 years ago or so, used all of her savings account and 401k to live off of. she finally got a job last year making half of what she used to make, but still able to pay her bills. she fell sick this year (stage 1-2 pancreatic cancer, found early, had surgery) so she was off of work since april. they were giving her half of her paycheck, and then whatever fell short i gave her money. i've paid her mortgage twice, i pay her comcast bill on the regular. my grandmother lives with her and she pays our phone bill. so all my mom really pays is the utilities of the house, and our car insurance. (me, her, and my brother). 

she has built up some credit card debt, which from what i can see on her bank account is $13k. she has some other bills that aren't paid, just because she couldnt afford it. 

my brother doesn't help her much, maybe a few hundred here and there, but it's never enough. i've used my savings account just to pay for her mortgage, when i live with my boyfriend and give him half for our mortgage too. needless to say, my account is going down. i get $1,300 every two weeks for my paycheck. depends on how much i work.

anyways, i called her life insurance agent and he was going to put in a claim, although we have to wait for her death certificate and her autopsy report. which having an autopsy done is costly and delays services. i just don't know what i am supposed to do with all of her bills, the car insurance, the phone bill, the house.. i don't know what to do with it all, and it may seem early to be thinking of this, but i want to be ready to know what to do. 

my grandma lives with her. i don't know what to do with my grandma. i think she plans on staying in the house but that's a lot of money to keep paying off when i don't live there. 

also, i know she has a will. how do i find out about that? do i need to get a laywer?

please anyone.. help me



edit: we live in illinois.
edit again: i forgot she has social security income from when my father died for me, and apparently they paid her ""too much"" so she was supposed to/have been paying that back too. i don't know if she has been.
i believe she owes the irs money too.

"caught gf sending lewd photos - but how do i go about acting on this.... quick back story, i was told by her in feb that a guy at her work fancied her, she said she wasn't interested. turns out she met him out of work once (as 'friends'), i hit the roof, she said sorry, blah blah, the usual. he left her work and got another job a few weeks later (unrelated). a few months later she asked how i felt if she met him to 'catch up' as he had left her work, i was not happy at all and made it known, she said she told me about it to be clear and honest, no funny business, etc. i said again, i'm not happy but do whatever because otherwise i'm 'controlling' but i trust her to make the right decision. she still met him.

at this point i'm ready to call time on this shit but - we have a mortgage. i need to get financial advice regarding this. we're not married.

&#x200b;

fast forward last night.

&#x200b;

i caught her sitting on our sofa sending lewd selfies (lifting her top etc), however there's a twist. so obviously i've suspected this shit for months, i popped upstairs and left my phone upright on a desk near the sofa recording... and boom, played back the video a little later and saw it. 

&#x200b;

so where do i stand in this. it feels awkward because i secretly filmed this (which i know is fucking weird but i suspected something, needed to know, and well.. it turns out i was correct). 

&#x200b;

what should i do? i can bet without doubt it will be turned on me 'having trust issues' or something and what i did will make me the fucking bad party in this. make no mistake, i'm fuming, i blame her in this, not the guy. it takes two to tango.",7
"update i(28m) wrongly accused my girlfriend (24f) of cheating. i don't know where to go from here.. so, my last post (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw31od/i_28m_wrongly_accused_my_gf_24f_of_cheating_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) got a lot of responses and i decided to do a prompt update as a lot has changed in just the last day and i wanted to update anyone who was interested and/or concerned for my girlfriend. 

i read your responses and decided to make a big apology to my girlfriend for how i behaved. however, before i got chance, she arrived at the house. 
i'll hold my hands up and say that this isn't the first time i've jumped to conclusions and pretty much since we got together, i've had a habit of winding myself up and then checking her phone/accounts. i know it's wrong, but i always felt if i found something i'd be justified which is so messed up, i know. 

my ex did cheat on me. well, she had an affair and left me for the other dude. i guess i projected this onto my current girlfriend. my girlfriend never, ever has given me any reason to doubt her and treats me better than i've ever been treated before. she's down to earth, honest, open, funny, kind, beautiful and she gives me to opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings with no judgement. 

i don't know why i assumed the worst of her, i really don't. 
to answer a common question - she has online banking app on her phone and it's the same passcode as her mobile so i could log on. super super fucked up, i know. 

when she arrived at the house, she was calm but sad. she explained that she knew i'd always check her phone and that i'd be ""off"" with her anytime she went out with friends but that she always hoped over time, if she proved herself, i'd let go. when she found out that i'd done what i did, it hurt even more because she was trying to do something nice for me. 
she told me she loves me but she finds herself justifying every activity she does, over explaining herself and told me she has real, genuine anxiety whenever she's out with friends because she knows i'll be sat at home imagining scenarios of where she could be. she found herself withdrawing from friends. 

she told me we were over. not because she doesn't love me, because she can't devote her life to someone who only sees the worst in her. she told me that i could have just spoke to her and she'd be honest but that she knows even if she did, i wouldn't believe her unless i could prove it and she's probably right. i don't know why, but i know in myself i would not fully believe her because i mean, of course she'd say that, right? anyway... she left me. packed up her things and went. 

i know her, she's a strong minded woman. it really is over and i've never felt worse. but she's right, i'm not ready to trust someone yet and even in our last moments, she gave me the confidence and motivation to get help and be better, even if she won't be there to see the change. i know she loves me and that fact alone makes it worth changing myself. 

i'm not going to try and win her back, because i can't promise i won't do it again. i'm heartbroken and hurt but she verbalised it in such a way, it really hit home. she calmly explained it to me in a way that only showed me her true love for me. 

i'm just so sorry for hurting her, i guess. 

but, thank you all for sharing your opinions and giving me some home truths. i appreciate it more than you know. 

this is it for now, hopefully this time next year i'll be a new man and be able to treat the next woman who loves me, the way my ex girlfriend deserved to be treated. 

**tl;dr** my gf left me. she made the right choice. i'm reflecting and moving forward.",7
"for not paying to save ""my"" dog's life after my mom ruined its health?. when i (22f) was 11, the family dog died. i was very sad and repeatedly asked my parents to get a new one. they finally agreed, on the condition that i'd be responsible for it and take care of it. that's how i got mickey, the cutest cocker spaniel and best boy ever.

i did take care of him. i took him for a walk every day. started spending my own money to buy him food. i was so motivated with the whole dog caring thing, i even read books and magazines on how to properly educate it. they made a big point of feeding it properly and not spoiling it with human food, so i tried to stick to dog food.

but my mom (53f) would still give him ""treats"" which consisted of pretty much anything she was eating, including sweets, chocolate and cookies. throughout the years i confronted her about it but she'd just brush it off every time. i tried to buy her ""good"" treats, actual dog snacks, that she could feed him, but she continued to feed it junk.

over the years, mickey started gaining weight. he refused to eat proper dog food, eating only my mom's junk food. he also grew very attached to her, mostly because she spent all day at home with him and fed him. i was still the one taking him on walks (not once did my mom do it), playing with him at the park, but he seemed to prefer her company to mine. she'd even make snide remarks about how he'd ""chosen her as his mommy"" and ""liked her better"". this only increased my resentment towards my mom.

fast forward a few years, i had to move away for college. i reluctantly agreed to leave mickey with my parents. his health started to decline even more. my mom didn't take him out at all, and without me to control her, he grew even more obese. every time i visited i'd see the poor thing getting worse and just looking sad and it'd break my heart.

this has been going on for four years. mickey is now eleven years old, half blind and with very limited mobility. last week, he started vomiting blood. my parents took him to the vet and found it's going to need surgery to survive.

that surgery's going to cost roughly $2000. my mom doesn't have the necessary funds and asked me to cover it. i told her i can't do it. i do have the money, but it's nearly all of my savings which i need for myself. i love mickey, but i can't justify spending all my money, specially when his health is so poor and he'll probably die from something else soon anyway.

upon hearing this, my mom accused me of being heartless and ""basically killing the dog"". she said i'm the reason she bought mickey in the first place, and reminded me of my promise to care for him. i told her she's the reason he's dying, and that she's been poisoning him for years.

later my dad called, told me i'm being unfair, that even if my mom hasn't cared properly for the dog, it's wrong to let him die ""just to punish her"". the dog's life is more valuable than an ""i told you so"" to my mom. he asked me to reconsider. i still said no, but now i feel really conflicted. so reddit, aita?",3
"for kicking my sister out of my wedding during the reception?. throwaway for obvious reasons.

i got married last saturday. hooray for me! my sister was my maid of honor. during her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how ""in that moment, i knew he was the one for throwaway..."" (so cliche!). i thought her speech was really selfish. i think it's super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. not only that, but the entire speech was about her. at my wedding. 90% of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how ""strong"" she was. nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! sorry if i sound selfish, but imo there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. so after the guests all greeted her, i asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. she was really upset but just left without arguing. my parents agree with me. but my husband and all of my close friends think i was way too harsh. aita?",3
"i cannot wait until facebook, twitter and instagram no longer exist.. for me, those 3 social networks are the epitome of vain pursuit and instant gratification. they also make dumb people more visible and gathers them instead of letting them disappear or change their perspective about things (flath earthers, racists, incels etc). these social networks have an undeniable bad influence on people and can be manipulated to generate artificial trends (russian bots in trump's campaign, russian bots involved in mexican elections etc).also they boost depression, social anxiety and antipathy.

maybe i should add reddit to this list too.

"gave my two week notice at work and they counter offered with more time and helping me find better job.. i'll start by giving some background on my current job. i have a unique job in a small company of about 150 people. i live two states away from the main office and basically work remotely. i get to make my own schedule for the most part and can take off days whenever i want as long as i can finish the work before the month is over. however, for the majority of the month, i travel to various client sites and i'd say my average mileage each month is about 1,500 miles. i am one of two employees in my entire state so i'm basically isolated and alone all month. i had moved from the main office a year ago where i had friends and more office/ less field work which was amazing. some of these sites are really unsafe and i've been witness to many bad incidents that have left me pretty traumatized. so i've been doing this job for almost 3 years and i'm just feeling done. there's no real way to move up in the company and get out of the trenches without moving back to the main office, which i don't want to move from my current state. i had planned on quitting without any back up job in november as well, though im not sure if i would have followed through. i've always had a job, starting at age 16.

so i started looking for work and 5 months later i get a job interview, a month later (this past monday), i recieved an email seeing if im still interested in the position. i say ""yes"". the new job is a lateral move though. they barely wanted to match my salary i'm making now ($23/hr) which is just above entry level for a college graduate wth my degree. i would get one extra week of paid vacation but i would be doing 9-5 and driving about 45min-1hr commute one way. there wouldn't be flexibility and i would be in a small kiosk but, i would have coworkers to talk to and people to do things with. i don't think there's much growth though within this job as there's only 30 people in the company. im not entirely thrilled about it either. i don't know why but i just don't seem to have excitement for the new job. i tried to request a month to give to my old employer but the new one needs me now. 

problem: 

i gave my two weeks notice yesterday and my current company panicked. most of the time, people give at least a months notice due to the nature of the job and training so im kind of cutting them short. the vp of the company called me and wanted to know why i was so unhappy, i told him, he asked why i didn't tell him i was looking? i've always been told never shoot yourself in the foot before you know you have a job lined up. he asked about the new job and i told him about it, that its linear, that im not all that thrilled, i just can't do this job anymore. 

so he countered by saying, if i stay and give them more time, he will help me find a new job that's probably going to be a step up instead of linear. he said he would help review my resume, write me a letter of recommendation, and use his contacts to find me a good job. if i stay longer. 

i know he's true to his word on this because i've personally seen two of our employees be hired out to our clients through the vp so i know he's not just talking smoke here. 

but now im conflicted. do i stay and do a job that i hate for just a little bit longer (amount if time unknown) if it means i have a chance at getting a real better job? or do i go to the new company, burn the old bridge, and see what happens?

im in a dual income marriage with only a cat, so if this blows up in my face one way or another, we would be fine for over 10 months. my partner is supportive of whatever i decide as well. i've talked to my parents and they both agree this is a hard decision. 

im leaning more towards staying though, because i know this company, i know the vp well, i think he can really help me. i just don't want to do this work anymore which i'd have to. neither of these jobs are my dream job. 

so good people at pf, what should i do?  

thank you for reading.

edit: hi everyone! thank you for all your comments! it seems to be a consensus to stay and see if my vp can help me. im at work now so my responses are slow. im continuing to read through the comments and i'll respond where i can. thank you all for your encouragement and insight. i'll be trying to get a written confirmation from him and tell the new company about my counter offer. you're all the best. thank you!

"for telling an anorexic girl to ""stay the fuck away from my girlfriend"". i've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (m18) (f17). since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder. shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). a girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, i'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. my girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

a few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. shes also been telling her things like ""why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

i eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment asap and was moved to a different room yesterday. a few hours ago i went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that i was an asshole for taking away her friend. 

things eventually escalated and i left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. 

am i in the wrong? i don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.

"friends is an overrated show and shouldn't have been kept on netflix at the cost of increased subscription payments. although friends is considered to be loved by ""everyone"", it has been blown out of proportion by fans claiming it to be the best thing on tv forever and always. i don't think that people who only have netflix to watch friends, or people that say they will cancel their subscription if its removed are serious. just buy the box set for friends and for a single price, why keep paying a monthly subscription to just watch a single show? netflix has paid around $100 million for the show to stream throughout 2019, and the payment before that was $30 million according to new york times. that money could've been spent getting more recent shows and movies that people want or enjoyed to continue to stream on the service for more that 6 months in some instances.

"june goal: do not buy breakfast or lunch out!. me: 31/f, fully employed, $3,145 net take home each month

i have been slowly working my way out of credit card debt for the past three years. with a little over one year of payments left to go on my $20k debt consolidation loan, i can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

with that, i have been closely monitoring where my money has been going this year. i am very good about tracking how my money is distributed (bills, rent, loan payments, etc) but have never been good about tracking what i have been spending my money on. in looking at my spending habits in january, february, march, april, and now may i have confirmed what i already knew in my head... i spend a shit ton of money eating out. in january, i spent $400 eating out on just breakfast (coffee) and lunches alone. in february, close to $500. same goes for march and april. i was way down in may because i made a conscious effort to not eat out so that i could save up for a trip i took. it helped a lot.

i took a look at my calendar and found that i miraculously have one lunch appointment on the calendar and no breakfast appointments in june. this means i have an opportunity to save money by eating breakfast at home and packing my lunch every day. 

i know this seems so simple but i haven't always been good about this. my work culture is such that people eat out a lot, i meet with people over coffee or lunches frequently, and so on. some of that i get reimbursed but a lot of it is just eating out with coworkers. i live in a mid-sized city, so lunches cost anywhere from $10-18/lunch. not terrible, but like many of you know, that adds up!

i'm excited to challenge myself this month and hopefully save a butt load of money. this money could be better spent either in savings account (that's dismal right now) or paying off loans. 

thanks for reading. i really feel like i am starting to make a turn in how i manage money and am so looking forward to financial freedom in the very near future. my june goal to not eat breakfast or lunches out will help give me the boost i need and hopefully, become a habit of mine.

**edit (6/1, 8:40am est):** 
wow! i wasn't quite expecting that type of response! a couple of things i learned from you.

* scaling back or cutting the number of meals you eat out can make a big difference financially.  
* it can also make a difference health-wise!  
* it's important to be strategic about when you eat out, especially when it comes to work and colleagues. even though you aren't going out and buying lunch, don't exclude yourself from group situations if possible.  
* when meal planning, variety is key. some of you mentioned getting bored with the meals you were making at home and as a result, would slip up and buy food.  
* r/mealprepsunday was mentioned several times as a resource for planning.  
* really examine why you're in debt to begin with. and once you pay off that debt, consider investing the money you no longer are using to pay down debt. your future self with thank you!  
* more than anything, it's about having realistic goals and making sure you aren't setting yourself up for failure. 

i very much enjoyed reading all of your responses, tips, and well-wishes! it has given me great motivation for today - day 1! for breakfast i had cheerios at home. i packed myself a lunch and headed to work where i am now sipping a free hazelnut coffee. 

i look forward to catching up with you all at the end of the month. for my own purposes, i will be keeping a daily log of what i spend (including non-food related items), what i meal prep and eat, and what noticeable changes i see. i've never had a ""blog"" so to speak, but i might consider starting one so i can share all of this with you later this month. any suggestions you have for sites would be most helpful!

cheers!

"i grew up on food stamps, do ok now but still struggling - what can i do to give my child a better start at life?. i come from generations of poverty. many of my cousins have been to prison, or live in trailers in the same dead-end town we grew up in. no one has a steady job, or a career to speak of. my mom did the best she could as a single parent, always working two or three jobs. i was never given any advice on how to plan for a life, career, college, etc. and so i took some classes but still don't have a degree (in my thirties), neither does my husband. we make an ok living, probably lower-middle class income, but we are still struggling at times. 
our kid is five, what do i need to do to now to help him become the first person in our family get a college degree? seems like everyone else is successful by this point in our lives and we're still struggling. i don't want him to have to struggle so hard just to get by... 


edit: getting a lot of comments along the lines of 'don't have a kid if you can't afford it.' just to clarify, we can afford it just fine. we don't have 8 kids, we have one. my question is in regards to ""how can i help my child get out of the lower class? middle and upper class people have access to lots of information and resources that i didn't growing up - what are those things? what are the basics i need to start teaching him now?""


edit2:wow, this is getting some attention! here's a little more details:

*we've since moved away from the dead-end town in a bigger city, so no sleazy family influences to deal with

*we picked our current location based on the best public school system in the area, but it's still only rated about a 5/10

*we're good on the basic-basic daily needs, we have a budget, but just can't ever get ahead on getting an emergency fund together

*financial situation is mostly due to me not having a college degree, and my husband finally got his ged last week (hooray!)

"update: today i found out my (19m) boyfriend has been cheating on me (18f) with his mother for our entire relationship. (my original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ghhsm/today_i_found_out_my_19m_boyfriend_has_been/?st=jm70cr7v&sh=e5637263) ) 

i have no idea where to start with the events that have occurred within the past 11 hours since i last   posted. i am still shaken up and this is hard to process. 

my bf finally messaged me back a few hours after i asked him to meet up with me. he agreed to meet me at his apartment. i made sure that i was going to talk to his dad before him so he could help me find the correct course of action for my bf. 

well i met with the father (we will call him x). i was so scared before talking to x that i was shaking. my voice was unsteady and i had tears in my eyes when i walked in. i had no idea where to begin. x looked concerned so he sat us down across from each other. i told x that i believe his son has been sexually abused for 6 years now. of course, x was taken aback. i started to tell him about what my bf told me. that's when x started to be more and more puzzled. he stopped me while telling the story i knew about my bf and his mother. x told me that there's no way this is completely true. when he says this i start getting confused as well. x tells me that my bfs mother died in a car accident when  he was 8. x never remarried or had a gf. at this point i am dumbfounded and i have no idea what to say. 

x tells me that he didn't think my bfs mother was sexually abusive while she was alive or why my bf would even tell me this. x also tells me that he have no idea who ""mom"" might be on his phone. i take a few minutes to calm down and think before i head over to my bf's apartment.

the drive was only 10ish minutes from x's house to my bf's. i took this time to process what x told me and what i would say to my bf. when i got to the apartment i promptly went inside. i demanded answers immediately. i asked the truth about his mother, the messages i saw, and if they've really been having sex since he was 13. of course he apologized again and gave me the same story but it made me angry. this is where i lost my cool.

i yelled and told him that x told me that his biological mother had been dead for almost 11 years. i told him i knew there was no way the story he told me was true because his mother passed when he was 8 years old. my bf became silent and looked down. at this point i was crying uncontrollably. i felt so bad for what happened and i wanted to get him therapy. i was willing to forgive him for keeping the secret from me. my bf was silent for a few minutes then finally spoke to me. he told me he made the whole story up. the contact he had as ""mom"" was an ex girlfriend he regularly hooked up with. she was 20 and a bartender in our city. he put her name as mom so i wouldn't get suspicious that he was talking to another woman so often. he didn't think i would find out so he fabricated the whole story up. this way, i wouldn't be mad at him. he told me he figured i would feel sorry for him and stay with him. 

i felt so betrayed when he confessed this. in past few days i went from having a healthy relationship to thinking my bf had been sexually abused by his mother then to find out it was all a lie just because he didn't want me to know he was sleeping with this ex. he tried to justify it further, telling me it was meaningless and he only loved me. i told my bf that i want nothing to do with him and left. he tried to follow and plead with me but i ignored him. i drove home, threw out all everything he gave me, and blocked him (once again.) 

i cannot believe he lied about something so major just to protect himself. i haven't stopped crying  since i left his apartment. i'm so hurt and now i don't know what to do. i no longer want him in my life. i'm considering moving towns so he can't find me. he has gotten online and used a fake number to try and get ahold of me to apologize. i need to clear my head and try to take everything in. i will turn off my phone and computer for a while so he can't try to contact me again. 


update: so my now ex-bf came to my apartment and started banging on the door, begging to be let in so we could talk. at this point i have turned all the lights off. i am being quiet so he will hopefully leave. i know he can see my car out front so it's obvious that i am here still. i want to call the cops but i am not sure there's much they can do. i'm thinking about going back to live with my parents until this blows over with him. i am also considering talking to his ex that he was hooking up with. i got her full name and where she works. i will keep updates as i learn more about my ex-bf.

update #2: i am having a lot of people send me messages so thank you for the kind words! i can't reply to everyone's messages so at the bottom of the comments i added some additional commentary on everyone's suspicions. please read it to answer any questions if you're still unsure. please note that there are some personal details i left out in order to keep privacy! (ex. how his mother died) there's a reason he didn't talk about it.

"update 26/m my girlfriend (24/f) just told me she wasn't ready to get married, how do i respond?. hey, this post is a follow up about a post i made earlier this year back in february (2018). i had proposed to my girlfriend of three years as a surprise while we were out skiing. it didnt go like i had thought it would. she said no. she wasnt comfortable because we hadn't talked about everything yet and we were still working on things. and you shouldn't pop a life changing question on someone and expect them to answer right away if you haven't previously had serious conversations about it.

well on december 2nd, 2018, i asked my girlfriend again if she would marry me. i asked her while snowshoeing this time. she said yes!!! we are now engaged and happily looking towards the future.

"for spending my sons lottery winnings money?. i have a wife (wilhelma, 40) and two sons (sam, 17, and scott, 16).  6 years ago, i ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) i decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  it was a blast.  we all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  i mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  but i specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  well wouldn't you know it, sams ticket won.  of course its actually my ticket, and i had to claim it.  it didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  i sat them both down and explained that i was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  they absolutely wanted a gaming system, and wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  we all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200b;

i bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a disney world trip.  the boys don't even like disney, but it was always wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  another $5k.  last year, sam wanted a car.  wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so i agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  i pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving scott to his stuff as well.  wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200b;

since day 1, i've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  i've always spent my own money on all this stuff.  i have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  wilhelma knows i have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  she knows i was investing the lottery winnings as well.  i've always told her about the money doing well, but i guess i never explicitly said how well.  she also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200b;

sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  while looking at the portfolio, wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  i told her i invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  she then asked why we're only giving sam $30k when it should be $50k.  i said no, the other $40k is mine.  i managed this account, i made the investments, i did all of the work.  plus i paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. the $40k stays and i'll keep investing it.  if the boys need the money, its there, but if not i'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  she thinks i'm stealing ""his"" money since i wouldn't have been able to invest with it if i didn't have it to begin with.  i say its always kinda been my money, and i'm still giving him the $30k i promised him since the beginning.",3
"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw update. so some of you may remember my original post where i accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest dick i've ever seen:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bo6nut/tifu_by_swiping_on_my_girlfriends_phone_nsfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

i've had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (i don't have them and i don't want to see them again).

the truth is there isn't much of an update because i never confronted her about it. i decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.

our sex life is back to normal and i feel like i've mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. we all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  

i thought i would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.

—

why does she still have the pictures?

honestly i think she probably forgot. we all have stuff on our phones going back years. i found some nudes of exes that i had forgotten about so i guess i'm as bad as her.

how did you know it was her ex?

because i could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in

was it photoshopped or a strap-on?

no

you must be exaggerating no dick is that big

2 coke cans is about right. it was bigger than her forearm.

as you can imagine, i've also received a bunch of dick pics in my dms with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. thanks for that chaps.  

a dick that big couldn't get hard

it certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. so maybe you're right.

her pussy must be stretched/cavernous/gaping

she probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls i've been with. i guess you don't know how vaginas work.

someone told me that my original post was the most upvoted nsfw post in the history of reddit. i don't know if that's true, but i guess that's pretty cool.

"by showing my tinder date's mom my bare ass.. obligatory it happened a month ago. 

i started hooking up with this guy from tinder. he lives with his brother in an apartment, and his mother comes occasionally to spend time with them. 

we decided to indulge in a little herb smoking one saturday night. the munchies kicked in around 2am so we made some potato wedges in the air fryer. came back and spooned to sleep. 

i wake up the next morning, with his morning wood pressed to my butt. this, for some reason turned me on and we proceeded to have lazy spooning sex at 6:30am.  

midway through it, we heard his apartment's main door open. tinder dude stopped and got up, confused. i was still lying on the bed, wearing his t-shirt and boxers, which were pulled down to my knees. ass visible, in all it's glory. 

now i was still under the impression that his room's door was locked. i was wrong. his mother opened the door and i swear she had the same expression as the shocked pikachu meme. :o

she immediately closed the door. i ran to the washroom and got dressed, and hid inside for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out if jumping from the washroom window would be a good escape plan or not. 

turns out she came early to take the dog (who was in the same room as us the entire time) for her vet appointment. 

i left as soon as she left.

she later had a conversation with her 22 year old son about consent, and respecting women. she asked him if i was his girlfriend, to which he had to explain his very catholic mother that ""we're just two friends trying to figure things out"". 

spoiler: we ended up dating. thankfully his mother joked it off the next time we met saying ""hi, i'm *****, tinder guy's mom. i didn't get a chance to introduce myself the last time we met."" (chuckles). 

tl;dr: tinder date and i got too baked and forgot to lock the room. woke up the next morning to pip pip the diddly doo and got walked in on by the dude's mum. and that's the story of how my now so's mom saw my bare ass before she could see my face first.

ps:  we never ate the wedges and he found them lying in the air fryer a week later. 

edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

edit 2: holy shit i can't believe this blew up. my account is juuuusssttt 4 days old. man i love reddit. 

edit 3: this one's more like a clarification. i live in a non first world country where it's fairly common for people to live with their parents/for parents to come over. his mom was supposed to pick the dog up to take her to the vet, and was being nice by not wanting to wake her son up. she had the house keys, which is again, fairly normal here. we were dumbasses.

"cheating? found a clean sock that is not mine.. i believe my girlfriend is cheating or has cheated, am i crazy? i've been together with her for about 6 years and live together. i'm not the jealous type, the type of guy who questions friends, or snoops throuh phones. there are no clear cut signs of infidelity except for two recent events that were odd. the first event, we enter her car and i get a hint a cigarette smoke, nothing crazy but odd considering neither of us smoke. i say out loud ""it smells like cigarettes in here"" she then starts acting very weird and changes the subject while still acting off. brushed it off, never smelled like cigarettes again. the second and more alarming sign was going through my clean clothes and finding a single men's white sock, alarming because i only wear black and our laundry is done at home, not at a laundromat. i question it this time a bit more sternly but without accusations, ""it's not mine, it's not yours, who's is it?"" the response was i don't know possibly when you used to do laundry at the laundromat (meaning i took it without knowing). while this response seems totally feasible i have to remind everyone that we have our own washer and dryer, i haven't used a laundromat in 3 years and when i did it was before i lived where i do now, lastly in the past 2-3 years i'm certain i would have noticed a single white sock in my sock drawer. so i'm asking everyone for help, is she cheating? other than being up front, what should i do to have more concrete evidence towards my suspicion? thanks.",7

"teachers are not martyrs. they are working professionals trying to make a living just like the rest of us and the self-righteous attitude many of them have is honestly so annoying.. teachers like to complain about how they aren't paid enough and act like they're god's gift to society. now i'm not denying their importance but the thing is, all professions are important. doctors, lawyers, accountants, cleaners and garbage collectors all have important roles to play in society, and their pay is determined by the market and they only work 9 months of the year. 

also the thing is, many teachers suck. they literally just read off slideshows and textbooks, in my opinion only maths and science teachers really deserve credit. 

when i was in grade 5 my one teacher left halfway through the year and came back the next year (presumably with full pay) because she couldn't handle how naughty the kids were. like woman, that's your job. also, when i was in grade 10 my accounting teacher had a breakdown because one of the kids told her she was a shitty teacher (and truth be told, he wasn't wrong). she went crazy at him, kicked him out of the class and didn't come to work for 2 weeks after that. like, wtf. i worked as a waiter for several years during college and if a customer complained about me, i'd have to just suck it up and carry on, i couldn't lose my cool at the customer and god forbid i'd go awol for 2 weeks. 

so yeah. teachers like to act like they sacrificed their lives for the good of education, which they didn't. they chose to teach as a career and must deal with the good and bad aspects of the job.",6

edit 1: ""concept"" is probably the wrong word. obviously the process of adopting aspects of other cultures exists as a concept. i refer to the use of the term as a pejorative umbrella term to describe this process in terms of it being defamatory and / or derogatory to the culture in question.

"by connecting to my housemates bluetooth speaker while she was having sex. this happened yesterday but i didn't really know how to explain it until know.

it was my university's homecoming this weekend, so everybody was getting super drunk and just having a good time. during the day, my one housemate told me she was gonna be bringing someone home that night which i was totally fine with.

by the time she brought him over, i was in my bed trying to fall asleep. her room is right beside mine so i was already thinking that i would be able to hear them, but i just figured they would try to be quiet. once they got to her room, i could hear the bed creaking a couple minutes after. me being tired and wanting to drown out the noise, i decided ""i'll just put on my bluetooth headphones so i can't hear them."" now usually my phone auto-connects to my headphones, but this time was different. i saw that my phone had connected to something, but didn't bother checking that it was my headphones.

i opened instagram for a nice nightly browse, only to find out that the first video on my timeline wasn't playing audio. i thought my phone volume was low so i turned it all the way up. i was genuinely confused but began to hear a faint noise through the wall. by the time i realized my headphones weren't playing audio, it was too late; the monsters inc. theme started playing extremely loud from the other room. i promptly disconnected my phone and i hear a bang on my wall following a scream of ""legogh\_, is that you fucking with my speaker?!?"" i was speechless, i didn't say anything because i couldn't believe what had just happened.

it turns out that earlier in the day, i had connected to her speaker to play music and that's what my phone auto-connected too. after the guy left her room, i tried to explain to her what happened but she is convinced that i intentionally did it. they didn't even finish having sex because i killed the mood, and now she's extremely pissed off at me.

"my first date.. i'm a very socially awkward person.

so when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on tinder resulted in a first date i was ecstatic. we had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; tv shows, movies, and what not. after my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, i decided ""fuck it"" and asked if she wanted to see rogue one with me last friday night. she said yes!

the night comes and i decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that i wear on a daily basis. jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket i'd received from my mother on christmas. it was raining too so i grabbed an umbrella on my way out.

i get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. i wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. nervous, i walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. we shake hands, say hi to one another, and i ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. she says yes and off we go.

here's where it went south.

we're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. i'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what i did, but i immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. confused, she asks what i'm doing to which i reply, ""i got this.""  she quickly realizes what i'm about to do and starts saying ""oh, you don't have t-"". 

i cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. the silence quickly makes me realize what i've done. i mutter out a ""after you..."" and she continues to stare at me.

without a word, she ghosts me on the spot. i pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.

maybe next time.",4

"update to my (20f) boyfriend (21m) hates my vagina with a passion. first post. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c82g4x/my_boyfriend_21m_hates_my_20f_vagina_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

here's a quick update. you guys all really hyped me up so thanks for the thousands of pep talks, i wouldn't have been able to muster up the courage on my own. so i told him that i didn't enjoy sex. i could tell by his face that he already knew it wasn't fun for me and he was frustrated i brought it up. 

basicallyyyy i asked him to please do something for me for once or i can't do it anymore. i don't like giving ultimatums or being confrontational like that especially knowing he is in a tough spot. but he agreed to touch me over my underwear but he was very obviously trying to distract himself when i was getting wet by kissing me. he was upset afterwards and locked himself in the bathroom. i couldn't help but cry like it felt so fucked up, how does he get me off and then go hide in the bathroom. and he heard me so he came out and i said i hated him. not the most constructive thing to say but i couldn't help it. he said he couldn't do that again and offered opening up the relationship so i could have sex with other guys and get oral from them. 

i do not want to be in a polygamous relationships. i am a strictly monogamous type of girl. i don't want 2 boyfriends. so i told him that wasn't an option and he just shrugged. i asked him if he was gay and he said no. i asked if he was sure or if he had a traumatic experience or if he's trying to get out of doing the work. he told me we can break up if i want since he wouldn't answer my questions. and when i told him ok it's over, he started crying and i asked him to please tell me what was wrong and he said no. 

basically we broke up. i wanna help him and figure out what's wrong but he doesn't wanna open up so there. i didn't think he'd get emotional but yeah",7

i hit a kid on the top of his head as hard as i could. this happened about 9-10 years ago. our family would go to our friends house every thursday for bible study and the parents would be in the living room for a few hours and all the adults had a kid or two. there was about 15 kids at this house every time. there was one bastard that was so crazy and destructive and he never changed. he would just break random shit and do reckless kid stuff i think he was about 4-5 years younger than me. one day i was playing xbox 360 and for some reason you got in front of me and slapped me hard as fuck. this was the first time i'd ever experience anger. i been wanting to hit this kid for the longest and this was the only justifiable time to do so i took advantage of it. i got up and took the sharp end of the xbox 360 controller and   whacked him on the top of his head. he fell crying like a little bitch and surprisingly none of the parents got mad at me and let it be. me and my brothers still laugh about that die and i still don't feel bad.,11
"update: if i told my daughter to find a different hobby. belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

i won't lie when i say that i immediately ignored the majority of you telling me i was the asshole. or maybe ignore is the wrong word. i think i expected that from the get go, so being told i ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe sahms"" rolled off my back. but, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) i was setting for her. there was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, i'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. i've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. i won't get into details because i'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that i'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. i gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (surprise) i was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when i had to work at things i hated for the things we needed. it seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. that's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that i was so resentful. 

i like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (i never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to michaels) but i can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. i helped her build a miniature restaurant last saturday and i've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as i type this. i can't regain the time i've lost, but i can make sure she doesn't have to live the life i'm currently living.

"fl father is suing me because i won't give him any of my money. i \21f\ am from fl.

the title of this post pretty much sums everything up.

my dad wants to sue me because i refuse to give him any of the money i'm getting in a lawsuit. he says that i ""owe him for all the expenses he spent on my when i was younger"" and that i should do this because i'm his daughter and he is an old man who needs to survive. my parents are not married and they are not together and have not been together for quite sometime. i'm adding this in here that i am also the only person over my own financial information and i have no qualms with my mother stealing money from me **(even though when i was younger, i saved up over $160.00 from when my mom would pay me for doing chores in the house and getting good grades and when my father was staying with us, he stole that money from me, promising to give it back and never did).** 

i got into an accident about 6 months ago and i'm getting a pretty large settlement. i haven't disclosed the potential number to anyone but my mother, but due to where it happened and the extent of my injury and the recovery period, my father and other family members are pretty much being opportunist and trying to help me out throughout the whole thing because they're looking for handouts and i know this for a fact (so does my mom and she's the only person i trust in our family). i have a great aunt who keeps complaining that her retirement funds are getting low and that she needs someone to give her some money to help out because she's old, but that's for r/relationship_advice

anyway, i told him that i was not obligated to give him anything at all and that if he's only trying to be in my life for that reason, he needs to leave me alone.

2. file us on his taxes even though he was not living with us or taking care of us at all.

"public north carolina high school. says my son's hairstyle and color violates school's social norms. (update: found a way around it). https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/789wcm/public_north_carolina_high_school_says_my_sons/

i want to you all for the help and advice that you gave us. i realized that this, while stupid, is probably within the rights of the school. but that didn't mean there was nothing we could do. a lot of you brought up the idea of a using a wig. sadly, wigs also weren't allowed except for ""legitimate religious, cultural or medical reasons with prior approval.""

however, what did surprise me was that there were two girls who were on a green dye for months without a problem. this definitely sounded like gender discrimination. allowing that dye for girls and not boys. so i went in there to speak with the principal again, i told him that i'm recording the conversation and after speaking about wigs, told him that they're allowing girls to do that but not boys. principal said this is a matter of judgement because unnatural hair colors doesn't diminish the feminine attributes of women, but unnatural hair colors for men does diminish their masculine attributes. i got it then, that nonsense is all this has been about. they think a long and blue hair on a boy isn't manly enough.

i reminded him that this is gender discrimination and gender is a protected class. he remained silent for more than a minute, i expected him to say it's fine and they'll backtrack but i was shocked when he told me that i'm right, they'll reinforce this requirement for girls too. ""it's best to get rid of these unnatural colors from our school.""

i hate what i did. the last thing i wanted was to cause trouble for those girls or start a chain of actions that could have ended up with them being forced to change their favorite hairstyles. they were contacted too, and were given the same choice.

two days later my son came to me and said he's spoken with the girls and they have a solution. they want to dye their hair a very white silverish color. it's naturally occurring because you get it when you get old, and some people are born with it as well. i know the more mature thing would have been to tell him to end this game, but i was a teenager once as well and i was even more stubbern than he is now. so i allowed it.

the school didn't like it. the three of them were called to the principal's office where they argued their case that their hair color is naturally occurring now. they said it's the same color as one of the teachers who is quite old, ""are you gonna suspend mr. x as well over his hair color?""

the principal laughed at them and backed off. it's been a couple of weeks since then and there hasn't been any issues. and this new color looks good on my son.

"light i've faked my accent for 11 years. when i was 10 years old, i moved from scotland to new zealand and have been here for almost 11 years now. in these 11 years, i've somehow managed to fake an nz accent to most of my friends and work colleagues. 

the only time i speak in a scottish accent, is when i'm around family. it can get pretty confusing if a mate is round, or lets say i meet a girl etc. i think the reason why i put on the accent was to fit in at school, because kids are cruel and would make fun of the native tongue, so i just kept it going all through high school up until now.

i've realised now at 21, how stupid it is that i had to fake an accent to fit into society. i think back now and wonder, what if i never faked my accent? would life be different? probably not.... but i just thought i'd share this with you all.

"putin is right to tell greta to """"go and explain to developing countries why they should continue living in poverty and not be like sweden"". source(https://www.news18.com/news/world/explain-it-to-developing-countries-vladimir-putin-dismisses-greta-thunbergs-un-speech-on-climate-change-2331415.html)

putin is a corrupt dictator, a dick with few if any redeeming characteristics, and he does not give two fucks about any developing country.

that does not change the fact that he is fundamentally right on this.

for most of the developing world,  the cost of entry/adoption of renewable energy is prohibitively expensive.

if you are a developing country like nigeria, for example, you desperately need to build and run massive water cleaning plants for you capital, lagos, with a population of 22 million people, most of which lack sewerage and clean water.  you also need to build infrastructure like bridges, a train/subway system, tunnels, roads, airports, etc...all of that takes lots of electricity, concrete, steel, and lots and lots of co2 emissions. nigeria is very very rich in oil by the way, which they can extract quite cheaply.

so it would be a very interesting conversation to watch when some privileged kid from a rich country who always benefited from an amazing infrastructure build on the back of fossil fuels, tells nigeria that they should not build that inexpensive coal/oil power plant in order to run that water purification plant that they desperately need, because they will be worse off in the end due to global warming. that they should wait many more years and save a lot more money to build a solar power plant instead (never mind the issues of energy storage or running the water plants at night).

yes, many of their children might die of dysentery in the mean time, but on the long run, it will be better for the planet. it would be a truly fascinating conversation to watch.

i figured i owed you all one final update. idiot neighbour will now forever be known as asshole neighbour. we received a letter from a law firm representing them. the letter basically says we put obstructions in the driveway when we knew they used it on a daily basis?!?!?!?!?! they are now willing to settle for the cost of repairs plus attorney costs. i don't know if expletives are permitted here or not but fuck them. i may not be able to block them using our driveway (see below) but i won't be paying them anything ever.

we have heard back from the city police and they won't do anything unless we are threatened. a wave doesn't constitute a threat so they want no part of this.

i also got a copy of the property map and the city owns more than half the distance between the house and the road (give or take, the city portion is about normal car length). we are granted a right of way. technically asshole neighbour has no right to use it but nothing will be done by the city to block this (and there is no bylaw against it). lastly, we cannot trespass people on the city's portion of our driveway. i have a feeling that asshole neighbour was made aware of this sometime around when they started using our driveway again.

"by trying to shake obama's hand and almost getting taken out by secret service and ruining thousands of peoples day.. as with most tifu, this did not happen today but the memory was spurred by a post i saw on the front page. during the 2008 election, obama came to my university to give a speech. i went through all the usual security screenings and made my way to my seat. i was about 3 rows from the front but on the outside seat of a row right against the entry and exit way for the future president. 

when obama came out, he went straight to the podium to give his speech and do a qanda session. when he finished he made his way down the steps where the crowd rushed to shake his hand. i was probably 4^th or 5^th down the walkway to shake his hand. everybody in front of me was not only shaking his hand but handing him copies of his book to sign. he had a pen in his hand and was signing away. i thought to myself ""damn, i don't have anything for him to sign. hmmm oh wait! yes i do. my ticket i used to get into the event."" there was only 1 issue with the ticket, it was in my jacket pocket...**my inside jacket pocket**. so as the future president is 4 people away, i hastily reach my hand into my jacket pocket to grab my ticket but my hand kinda fumbled around a little before latching onto the ticket. just long enough for the 2 secret service agents standing right in from of me to notice...

they immediately grabbed both my arms, while the one who grabbed my arm that was in the jacket twisted it to pull my hand out of the pocket while preparing to break my arm off if it was any kind of dangerous object. it all happened so fast i couldn't even utter a word, but when they saw all i had was a piece of paper for obama to sign, he let go of my arm, patted me on the shoulder, and mumbled something into his headset. i was just able to get my bearings about me and i was the last person to shake obama's hand at that event.  about that time the security all turned to obama and shuffled him through an open door to the hallway to exit. as obama was being ushered out he said ""sorry guys, they said i have to leave now."" as he was pointing at the secret service around him. so not only did i almost get taken out by secret service, i ruined anybodies day that wanted a chance to meet the man.

"by wearing jeans with a hole in them. this just happened minutes ago. i'm in a children's hospital with my wife and son because he's been having severe asthma issues.

my wife is laying in the bed with my son on top of her, and i've just been sitting in one of the chairs. as people kept coming in, i noticed some rather odd looks from them, some mumbling, and some more odd looks. i figured i had some food on my face or something and didn't think too much of it.

suddenly, i'm sitting there reading something on reddit when my wife looks at me and says, ""what's that between your legs?""

i look down, and there's a pink ball between my legs. confusion quickly turns to shock as i realize that pink ball is one of *my* balls. one of my testicles is literally hanging out of my pants and is sitting on the seat.

i don't have a spare pair of pants here, so now i'm just sitting with my legs tightly together like i'm wearing a skirt and praying my son doesn't stay here long.

tl;dr i found out i had a hole in my pants by multiple people noticing a testicle sitting on my chair.

**edit: most common question is about my undergarments. i was indeed wearing boxers. my testicle came out the bottom of them.**

edit2: wow this post really got the ball rolling (what, i can't do testy puns too?). thank you kind stranger for the coconut reward! i had no idea such an appropriate award existed for this situation.

**edit3: i got pants! as several people suggested, i explained my predicament to the nurse, and she hooked me up with a pair of scrub pants. they'll make excellent pajama pants.**

and thank you for another coconut! i have two now! how fitting. thank you, kind stranger.

edit4: another coconut (three nuts now—one can fall out, and i still have two left) and a silver. thank you again!

edit5: popped my gold cherry. guess everything is popping for me today. thank you, internet stranger!

**edit6: dammit! replacement pants are actually worse than original pants. here's me wearing them on top of my pants(https://imgur.com/a/xi6y80b). the ""fly"" makes no sense. wife confirms it.**

edit7: thank you to /u/jedberg for evening out my balls at two pairs and another kind stranger for more silver!

**last ever edit: son is doing better. we can hopefully leave tomorrow. my ball has been staying put in two sets of pants. thank you for all the love and support everyone. sorry for going a little (lot) edit crazy. just overwhelmed by all the support.**",4
"""the best time to look for a job is when you don't need one."". really, the best time to look for anything is when you don't need it, but this is specifically about job hunting and how it worked out for me. 

the quick background: i've been in manufacturing 20+ years, mid-level management for the last who knows how long. i happen to love my current job. i have a great crew, good benefits, a boss that let's me run my department with very little interference, close to home... etc. the pay, definitely below industry standards, but people put up with it because of the perks. basically, you trade lack of stress for lack of pay. 

a long time ago, i was told that you should always keep an eye out, never get too comfortable, so i did. over the last few years, i applied for a few different jobs, and listed very high salary requirements knowing that if i didn't get an offer, i'd be okay because i was in a job i enjoyed. 

i received an offer recently for a position i have a great deal of experience with, and was able to negotiate a 53% increase in salary. similar benefits (though obviously i don't know about the team, etc). i hit it off with my new boss very well in the interview, i have no worries there. 

i'm very excited about this position, and thought i would share with the rest of pf that even if you're happy, keep an eye out, and take a shot at improving your wage bracket. you have nothing to lose by asking for what you want (if you're in a position you're okay with being patient with for a little while). you just might find out someone thinks you're worth it.

"final update : i divorced my husband because of my mil and now he wants back in.. so i thought of giving you the last update as you helped me trough this.

i didn't have enough evidence to request an ex parte, aka emergency child custody. so my lawyer and i had to work on steps to prevent child abduction. we got a custody decree that included provisions including passports, travel restrictions etc.

we also had to be very wary of the signs. he in fact quit his job and on a realtors page i saw that he was putting on sale his mother's house. that and my daughters words was all we needed to notify law enforcement for them to keep an eye out.

i couldn't prevent my daughter from seeing her father. we tried to continue business as usual without my daughter feeling something was up. 

 i got a call from the police department regarding the passport situation. my daughter's passport had expired very recently (5 years validity). my ex husband had tried to recuest a passport for my daughter without my knowledge. which was stupid because even without the decree i had to be present or submit  a notarized document of me stating that he could request the passport.

after that things went actually very fast. he was investigated because he violated the decree and it was found out that mil had bought 3 tickets with no return date to mexico. i could request an ex parte. after a shit ton of documents i submitted it. in most cases the judge will evaluate behind closed doors. we had the hearing yesterday (it takes usually 10 to 20 days) wich was very good for me. atm i have sole custody for my daughter. this is all temporary. my ex has visitation rights if i was present but he can't take her anywhere. this is once the investigation of him is closed. 

i was cursed out by my ex and ex mil and they said they will try to contest this but they have no leg to stand on.

my daughter will continue in therapy. specially after this. i will not prohibit him from seeing her but he needs help.

this was really scary and a very intense 2 weeks. i don't think that i will update again but i wanted to thank you all for your tipps and support. i am really thankful as i am finally not anxious the whole time! thank you really much!",7
"i sometimes overcharge rude customers.. i work in a food shop, and quite often i'm working on the tills. i am always very polite and say hello to every customer. some are polite back, however others are rude, they don't say hello, don't pack their own bags, put their basket in the wrong area, and don't even say please or thank you when i pack their bags. it doesn't take a lot to have basic manners. 

in my shop, bananas are weighed to determine the price, using a scale at the till. when a customer is rude, and is also buying bananas, i place the bananas on the scales and then push down slightly with my hand. i realise this doesn't impact them much, the difference would only be a few pennies, however it gives me some satisfaction, even if it is slightly petty. 

edit: a small minority of people in this comment section are acting like i overcharge every rude customer i come into contact with, by large amounts. i do not do this. i may overcharge the odd customer by pushing down on the scales a bit harder, but i don't do this to everybody. for the most part, i just grin and bear it, however everybody has to 'vent' occasionally, and so slightly overcharging those people is how i get some satisfaction from a rather mundane shift. those saying i need to be fired are seriously overreacting. some people here just need to get a grip.

"half of 2019. *throwaway because only reddit can know that my life is written and directed by adam sandler.* 

**list of fuck ups i've experienced so far - the 2019 issue:**

1.

mispronounced my new girlfriend's name when i introduced her to old friends of mine.

2.

dropped an f bomb during an important job interview when i accidentally bit my own tongue.

3.

ignored my broken tooth for weeks and ended up in hospital with inflamed and infected gums. 

4.

changed my instagram name to @onetruegenuis and realized i misspelled 'genius' when several of my friends and colleagues jumped on the chance to point out the irony of my illiteracy. 

5.

unknowingly opened a dick pic sent to me from my father who thought he was sending that shit to my mom. 

6.

speaking of dick, somehow drunk me managed to get his poor balls stuck on his zipper twice in one night (the second time i had to call my best friend for a helping hand: i said no homo, he did not). 

7.

took a random ride on my younger cousin's bmx bike, sat my ass down mid-ride, and was painfully reminded there was nothing but exposed steel to fucking sit on (tl:dr got butt raped by bmx).

8.

suffered an asthma attack while masturbating in the shower and almost blacked out while waiting for my dick to defuse before i had the courage to call my roommate for my inhaler. 

9.

visited my sister in law who told me not to freak out if her pet bird decides to fly over to sit on my shoulder. the bitch fucking flew like 10 seconds later and i freaked the fuck out. i dodged the damn bird on instinct and inadvertently caused it to fly face first into the window behind me. it survived, but my sister in law made damn sure i didn't.

"if you are moving/just moved, make sure you sign up for the amazon move discount. discount is 10% off on purchases ""shipped and sold by amazon.com"" for 3 months after you arrive. i found my coupon when i changed my address online with the postal service and they showed some promotions afterward. a lot of people might not find out about this until after they already move in and miss out and buy some big ticket items without the discount.



as far as i can tell, amazon doesn't actually verify whether you moved or not so do with that info what you'd like. i'm not sure about posting links here but the easiest place i have found is to just google ""slick deals amazon move discount""

also, since i just moved, id love some other tips/tricks/discounts on saving money due to a move:)

edit: i see a lot of people commenting on boycotting amazon for their treatment of workers, and i would urge you if this is something really important to you, to look at other companies (such as fedex and walmart) and their warehouse conditions. amazon may not treat their workers the best but they are far from the worst in an infrastructure of warehouses that makes our current society possible. i'm not judging any of you commenting :), just hoping to shed some light on a lot more people getting treated unfairly but without the national coverage being that this has kinda blown up.",10

"bullies who pick on kids to the point of suicide should be shown the body of their victim.. as long as there's solid evidence that they're guilty of harrassing/bullying/torturing the deceased (there should be a thorough investigation first) i feel like they should suffer like the family of their victims and the victims themselves. if they're that hateful that they drive someone to take thier own life then they should bare witness to the consequences of their actions, i don't feel like it's enough to just tell them, show them. obviously with the permission of the family. 


i also feel like they should answer to the family of the person they bullied, really get a feel for what they have done. it will probably scar them for life, good, the pain the family will be in for the rest of their lives is incomparable so the guilty party should feel at least a percentage of that. 


it may seem harsh but i just read a story about a young boy who layed in front of a train and killed himself due to being bullied. he was 14. he killed himself in front of 40/50 other students including his friends who will also be scarred for life. all because some vicious little pricks harrassed him until he no longer saw a light at the end of the tunnel. and what will the guilty get? slap on the wrist? expulsion? ridiculous. teach them a lesson, make them look at what they've done and give them the opportunity to apologise face to face to the families who have been broken by the sadistic actions of these nasty, spiteful kids. i'm talking high school and up because that's generally where it gets bad, although this is starting to creep into primary schools too which is horrifying.


if i thought for one second that any kind of preventative measure would work then i'd suggest that instead. but years of unrelenting abuse and families losing their kids to suicide has lead me to believe that there is no tactic of prevention that would actually work worldwide. that hurts my heart. people are so cruel. i don't want to send my baby to school, i'm terrified. and my heart is broken for that poor boy, his friends and family, and all of the innocent kids who saw such a horrific scene unfold 4 days before their summer holidays began.

"(nsfw) my friend called the 911 on his gfs mother claiming she was a danger to herself. she has a histoey of mental illness. when the cops showed up, she accused my friend of hitting her. he was arrested, she was left alone in the apartment. the next day she comitted suicide.. as the post says, my friend and his girlfriend lived with her mother and  were taking care of her. i believe the gf was her legal guardian. the mother has a history of mental illness, self harm and sucide attempts. she was just released from the hospital for medical reasons. the other night my friend believed she was a serious danger to herself and call 911 trying to get her to a hospital. ( they did not have a vehicle to take her themselves, nor would she of allowed that ). when the police showed up, the mother claimed her hospital brusise were from my friend and claimed she was abused, she may have been senile enough to of not remembered the hospital. my friend was arrested, and the police said his gf had to leave. he was out on bail, moving his stuff to my house, with his gf working, when the mother committed suicide. the gf went to check on her after work and she found the body. all this could of been avoided if the police took her in and treated her. what are their options? they are young, broke, and in a seriously awful place at the moment. 


edit: wowzer, i can't even begin to thank everyone who has left a message. im still trying to figure out more details of the night, but the gf is blaiming herself and my friend is trying to hold everything together for her sake. thank you to everyone who was nice enough to leave a response, i'll will be sure to talk to my friend tonight as i believe they are staying at my place for the next few weeks. 

edit 2: also, her death was ruled a suicide. both of them were working when it happened. and my friend who was arrested, he is literally one of the nicest people you could meet. i know that's probably thrown around alot and what most people would say in this position, but growing up i was a dumb kid while he was the most sweetest innocent kid i ever knew.

"for evicting my son for moving in his girlfriend?. i own several properties and rent them out. my son is 20 and goes to school near one of the properties (10-unit luxury apartment). it's cheaper to let him live there rent-free than living in the dorms. obviously the condo is much larger (three bedrooms, 2 bath, gym on-site) private, quieter, etc. i put several conditions on his living there rent-free. nothing shocking; no smoking (he doesn't), no parties, keep the place clean, turn off the lights when you leave and no moving people in. a couple of months ago, i noticed that the utilities at the condo skyrocketed because he moved in his girlfriend. his girlfriend was having issues with her roommates. to add insult to injury, this girl moved in her friend who came out to la to be an actress and had no where to go. i told my son i didn't give a fuck what problems these girls were having - no roommates or he can move out. he lied to me about their moving out. i told him again - no roommates - or leave. he started playing with semantics how they're not really moved in and just spends a night or two. i don't give a fuck. i could be charging 4k a month for the condo (this is westwood, ca) and by letting them stay there, it puts me at risk of their claiming tenant rights. that could cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost rent and legal fees. and if that's not bad enough, his girlfriend talks about the condo as if it's ""their"" condo.

&#x200b;

rather than fight with him, again, i asked my property manager to begin the eviction process on my son. i treat him no differently than people who don't pay their rent. i told my son i ain't paying for his boarding at school and his ass is going to pay rent if he moves back home. the commute from my house to ucla is a bitch. he's not 12. i don't owe him anything. he should be kissing my ring for paying for tuition and keeping him on my insurance plan.

"am i f22 wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiance f24 decided to publicly ""joke"" about my relationship issues in front of everyone?. a bit of background: me and boyfriend (recently ex boyfriend) definitely had our fair share of issues. he really struggled with insecurities and jealousy issues. the idea of me going to the gym alone was one he struggled with. additionally certain articles of clothing i wore were also an issue for him (he would get extremely upset seeing other men ""check me out""). he ultimately decided to seek therapy for these issues determined to fix them. after long discussion we decided it would be best for both of us to part ways as he tries to work through his own issues. this break up occurred not even 2 weeks ago, and of course still feels very raw to me. 

i regularly confided in my older brother about these issues throughout my relationship (we are very close). it has been apparent he has discussed some of these issues with his finance. i wasn't upset, i understood it was his finance after all. i felt comfortable that these discussions were between the three of us. 

however this was not the case tonight. everyone came to our house this evening for a bbq. this included my parents, all my siblings, and friends of my brother and i. i walked in the door in full gym attire as i had just came from the gym. my brother finances looks at me and loudly announces ""wow you really are single now! look at you actually being allowed to  go to the gym again! *insert annoying laugh here*"". the room instantly got silent, everyone looked to me with uncomfortable expressions looking for my reaction. i was so shocked it took me a second to process what she just said in front of everyone. my dad quickly realizing how uncomfortable i was, changed the subject and everyone began talking again. 

i was hurt by this so called ""joke"" but for the sake of the night i decided to let it go thinking that would be the end of it. nope. not even thirty minutes later, everyone is gathered around the table getting food buffet style. she looks at my outfit and announces ""oooh you wore leggings to the gym? must be nice to finally be able to wear leggings again without (ex's name) telling you what you can and can't wear"" again followed by her fake laughter. i instantly felt my blood boil (from anger and sheer embarrassment). i politely corrected her saying i was always allowed to wear what i like, despite his feelings of insecurities. 

no one in my family knew these details about our relationship. i had no intention of ever telling them. this was extremely personal to me. i excused myself to the restroom and quickly grabbed my car keys and slid out the backdoor. as soon as i started driving, i started bawling my eyes out. i know this may seem dramatic to some, but i was really effected by this. i was so shocked and angry by how another adult could ever think this type of behavior was ok. i received several texts asking where i was, and saying how i made a ""scene"" by leaving the dinner. i only responded to my parents letting them know i needed a bit of space. i also feel extremely hurt for my ex, as some of his friends were in attendance at this dinner. she has no right to publicly air my ex's very personal issues to his friends or to my family. am i wrong for abruptly leaving the family dinner and creating an apparent ""scene""?

j and i used to be friends in school, until i came out as gay and he began to distance himself from me and spread rumors. he then started saying it was gross/wrong etc.

years pass, and i'm scrolling through grindr when i spot a faceless torso picture, unmistakably his due to a set of freckles on his chest, the username being his first initial, and the distance from me matching where he lives. his profile states that is hookup only, with no face pictures given.

i think to myself ""oh, he came out, good for him."" then i look at his facebook. he's still spouting homophobia, sharing lgbt stories with his own opinions etc, and harrassing lgbt people that he comes across online.

so, to tell him if i found his profile and recognized him, many of the people he's insulted could easily find him as well?

"for asking my husbands sister to consider being a surrogate for us?. my husband and i have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. it took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. with that in mind, my husband and i came to his sister (sarah) with a proposal.

sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. my husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. with that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.

we invited sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. we told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. we told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

sarah exploded at us. she said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. she actually left early. right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. my husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind sarah's difficulties. my parents think she is behaving awfully. most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much sarah hates kids.

it's really weighing on my mind and i honestly never expected this kind of outcome. she literally blocked us on every platform she could. are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",3

"update: i (34m) think my wife (32f) is cheating on me.. original post from a few weeks ago:i travel a lot for work. i'm usually gone tuesday through thursday 3 times a month. my wife is a stay at home mother for our two children 3 and 5. we have a nanny that helps out 4 days a week during the day, so that my wife can take care of her errands and shopping. 
about 6 months ago i caught my wife in a lie. not a big lie just her telling me she was somewhere when i knew she wasn't. it bothered me but not to the point where i was extremely concerned. then a week before the 4th of july i came home early from my trip i wanted to surprise her, the next day was the anniversary of the day we had met. i had also received a fairly large bonus two weeks earlier and was going to surprise her with the trip i booked for us to go to st martin for a week. it was late when i got in from the airport around 11:30pm and we had facetimed about three hours earlier so i could see her and the kids. she never mentioned anything about going out that night. when i got home the nanny was there, she said to me that my wife had left about an hour and a half ago. i texted my wife asked her what she was up too, and she responded saying she was about to go to bed. i said thats funny because i just got home and you're not here. 
when she got home she was telling me that she was just out with two of her friends, she named them, and just didn't want me upset that she wasn't home with the kids (usually one of our parents would watch the kids at night we had never used the nanny before), i didn't really buy her excuse,  but i had no proof and she wasn't admitting to anything. 
the next day i ordered a gps tracker for her vehicle. i haven't told her about it. and since then i have caught her in several lies, and i'm not even trying to set her up. she is just telling me she is at one place and i can see she is clearly not. 
should i confront her with what i did and why is she lying to me or hire a private investigator to get proof of infidelity if it is happening? 

tldr i caught my wife in a lie so i got a gps for her car. then i caught her in multiple lies.

i hired a private investigator, gave him a lot of information. my wife has been acting normal all day. we had plans tonight, i canceled told her i was not feeling well (which is the truth). i don't think anything else will happen until i leave tuesday morning. i plan on calling my friend who is an attorney on monday, even though he is not a divorce lawyer i'm sure he can point me in the right direction. thanks for all the kind words and a few not so kind. i'll update when the pi does his thing.

update: so i hired a private investigator to follow my wife when i left on tuesday. he first followed her to the grocery store, he said he saw her purchase two visa gift cards. he told me that could be how she is paying the nanny for the extra time without giving her a check or cc. she left the house for a second time around 12:30 pm and went to the same location she has been going to. he witnessed an suv pull up and she got in. he followed the vehicle to a gated community where he lost sight of them. he was not able to view the driver due to the dark tint. he has a realtor license and used that to get in, but by the time he got to the house they were already inside. they were there for about 3.5 hours. he then saw my wife and another lady leave the house in the same vehicle, he followed them back to where my wife's car was parked. she went home and didn't leave the rest of the day.

wednesday 8/14 she went to a few shops with the kids. that night around 9:15 (i facetimed her and the kids around 8:30) she left and went to the same location. she again met with the same women. this time they went to a restaurant and ate for a little over an hour, then back to her house til 1:15am. she was again dropped off at her car and then went home.

so there was no guy involved at least this week, but she never told me she was going out for dinner or anything. i really don't know what to do now. the pi was pretty expensive i'm not sure i want to hire him again. not sure if i should confront her or just try an get more information on my own.

update: so these last few weeks have been difficult. i kept the pi following her when i have been out of town. it has been the same thing she meets at the same place and the same woman picks her up. this wednesday they went to dinner instead of her house. the pi got a photo of them embracing and a single kiss when they got to the place where my wife parks. the kiss is not something just friends would do. this is the first real evidence i have gotten, other than just strong suspicion. 
i flew home a day early, and last night i confronted her with the photos. i didn't tell her how i got them or that i had hired a pi. i asked her to explain why she was cheating and how long it had been going on. she basically denied everything and said that they were just friends. she then tried to accuse me of spying on her and invading her privacy. i couldn't believe it, even with the photos and her lying she wanted to blame me. 
i haven't moved forward with the divorce or anything yet, i'm still hoping she will come clean and tell me the truth.

update: so i have the woman's name,age and where she works from the pi. she is single no kids, she has a facebook account but no personal information on relationship status or recent posts or likes and she is not friends with my wife. no instagram or twitter that he can find either. i think i'm done with him he found out enough.",7
"update: un-permitted contractor next door did $5,000+ of damage to my home, contractor and homeowner won't pay or provide insurance information. hi r/legaladvice. just wanted to provide a ""thank you"" for all of the responses and an update on the situation detailed in my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atin99/unpermitted_contractor_next_door_did_5000_of/). basically, i'm a homeowner in philadelphia, pa, and a contractor working on my neighbor's house caused a leak that led to a lot of mold and water damage that needs to be repaired, and the contractor and homeowner have ghosted.

&#x200b;

since so many people suggested we file a claim with our homeowner's insurance, i gave that a shot. however, according to the adjuster i spoke to about our claim, our policy apparently has an exclusion for ""faulty workmanship"". even though it's completely insane, i was told that our insurance company would not cover the damage or provide any legal assistance because the damage was caused by someone doing work on the house next door. the adjuster told me this is a very common clause in insurance policies. basically, all insurance companies are completely manned by psychopaths and capitalism is an endless nightmare that will surely swallow us all.

&#x200b;

so now it looks like i'm back to square one. the police have suggested that i try to find information about the contractor and homeowner through the licensing and inspection department to pursue legal action, but previous attempts at that came up with basically zilch aside from a suggestion to hire a lawyer. so i guess i'll try and find a lawyer that will take this case, although my previous attempts to reach out to lawyers about this issue have not been promising at all.

&#x200b;

going forward, are there any additional avenues i should pursue? my insurance company (farmer's by the way. if you're thinking of going with them i might suggest drinking poison instead) is completely worthless. the two lawyers i've spoken to seem to have absolutely no interest in taking up a case, one of them specifically advised against hiring a lawyer because of the relatively low cost of the damage, the amount we'd owe in legal fees, and the fact that cases like this are rarely paid out even when they're successful.

"my (26f) husband (31m) cheated at his bachelor party. i don't know what to do. we got married in december and things were perfect. we've been together since i was 23. 

his friend is getting married and i noticed one of his other friends give my husband a funny look when talking about the new bachelor party. like raising his eyebrows and laughing. my husband did not react and ignored him but i knew something was up. 

we allow each other on our phones so he was sleeping one night, i was awake, i saw it and got tempted. went through messages and pictures. i saw a few things in his photos in the ""hidden"" album, he didn't really hide it too well but we don't go on each other's phones so he probably thought he was fine. i saw a video and a couple of pictures of a girl blowing my husband. it was fucking disgusting. he actually bought me a necklace when he came back, just realized he probably felt guilty or something. 

i read through his messages and saw his friends mentioning the party while planning the new one. he apparently snorted coke off some girls boobs too. my husband was telling them to forget about it and it was a long time ago and he was just having fun for one night and it would never happen again and he's committed to our marriage. he is so full of shit 

and i got pregnant on our honeymoon. i don't know what to do. how do i bring it up. what do i say. i feel so sick and dizzy ever since i found out. and i was at home, having a quiet tea party with my friends, opening up presents and talking about house decor. i feel so fucked over!! i can't believe he would do this to me",7
"read my friend's diary and it was worse than i expected.... i have been best friends with this girl for about 11 years now. her grandparents are super rich and own a huge shore house. for the past 2 years i've been staying down with her during the summer to work. we shared a room and had very different schedules, so i was alone a lot. she had recently gone through a very rough patch in her life and missed about a month of school. i was very left in the dark and was very scared for her. the summer seemed very healing though. i found a book in the room filled with poetry in her handwriting and i was skimming through it and found her suicide notes. she had already told me that she was sent to a mental facility and spent a week or two there, but i was not ready to read what was written. the first one was addressed to me and it just made me very sad.",11
"i blackmailed a 26 year old man when i was 16. when i was a 16 year old girl i was a frequent user of tinychat. i was a regular in this one for amwf relationships and was quite popular and loving the attention. i became friends with a 26 year old man, truly believing he was my friend and totally not just a creep. we would skype sometimes and he would tell me some really weird things about himself, but i would laugh it off because i have a gross sense of humor. 


one time he told me that he met a struggling single mother and he felt bad for her, so he paid her a few hundred dollars to do an enema on camera for him. she took the money and blocked him. he said he was so upset because he was just trying to be a good guy and help her out because she seemed desperate for money.


fast forward a month or so and i'm underage drinking and skyping with him. i had been passively complaining about being poor, as a 16 year old without a job does. he figures this is his big chance and gives me a proposition. i assure you that this next part is 100% true. he offered to pay me $120 to stick baby carrots in my butt for him. i'm like ""ummm, no thank you"" and he raises it to $160 if i do it twice a month for him. i tell him ""i respect your kink but please keep it away from me"". he keeps trying to convince me and offering better prices. meanwhile, i have another chat open with a bunch of friends from 4chan. i tell them whats up and ask if one of the boys wants to do me a favor when the time comes.


i sheepishly agree with carrot guy that i'll stick baby carrots in my butt for him and ask him when he wants me to do the deed. he says right now. that catches me off guard because he was at work in his cubicle at the time. im like ""wont people see"" and he tells me he'll go into the parking garage. so i go to my kitchen and realize that we only have regular carrots so i grab a few of those and a knife and tell him that i'll just cut them to baby carrot size. 


picture a dweeby 16 year old girl whittling away at some carrots with a knife while a 26 year old asian man watches from his office cubicle, dictating how big she should cut them. every time i would hold one of my creations up to the camera, he would tell me to go bigger. let me tell you, the end results were at least 3 times bigger than a regular baby carrot.


when i was nearly finished with the preparations, he made true on his promise and relocated to his car in the parking garage. that's when my head jerked in the direction of my bedroom door and i scrambled to hang up the skype call, clearly in a panic. i enter the 4chan chat and tell them project buttcarrot is a go. one of then calls carrot guy, pretending to be my furious and overprotective father. he asks carrot guy if he knew that what he was doing was illegal and could put him in prison. carrot guy sounds fucking terrified and is apologizing profusely(i'm listening in on the call). my 'father' tell carrot guy to send $500 to my paypal and he wont call the cops.


i bought christmas presents for all of my friends that year, never spoke to carrot guy again, and i didn't eat carrots for a long time.


epilogue: i'm 22 now and i moved across the country about a year ago, to the city that carrot guy lived in. no big deal, it's a really big city. imagine the adrenaline rush when i'm walking down the street and pass a familiar face on the sidewalk. i had to do a double take. never in a million years did i think i would come face to face with the one and only carrot guy. but there he was. luckily he didn't recognize me as my appearance has radically changed since i was 16, but that didn't stop me from looking over my shoulder for the rest of my day out.


i want to say that i have no regrets but honestly i have a few. one of them is that i didn't ask for more money, as he had a nice enough job anyways. another is that i didn't just go to the authorities. sometimes i wonder if he really learned a lesson from this, or if he went on to prey on other teenagers and if i could have saved them. 


edit: didn't realize how angry this would make people so i'm gonna clear a few things up for yall. first, this story is kind of funny so i tried to work that into my narration and wrote my two regrets in a way that i thought would be funny. yes, i do wish i got more out of the deal. because now that i'm an adult i realize that $500 aint shit.


more importantly, i really do regret not calling the cops. however, as dumb as they are i had my reasons not to. the biggest reason at the time was that i didn't want to ruin his life. i had gotten to know this guy over a period of almost a year, he painted a sad picture of himself to me so that i would pity him. and even though he was preying on me, up until that point i viewed him as just my friend. when you are a young girl in a predatory relationship like this, you don't notice the red flags like an adult would and you don't know the proper response. extorting him for money was not the proper response. if i could go back to that moment with an adult view of the situation i would have called the cops. but i didn't. whoops.


time and time again, i think about reporting him still. however, i no longer have access to the skype account i used to talk to him. and on top of that, unless they changed it recently, when you log onto a skype account with a new computer it doesn't carry over old conversations. i have no idea if there is a way to recover them. if there is, hit me up and i can provide sweet sweet proof of this whole thing(provided i can remember the email and password to the account itself).


but yeah, i probably shouldn't have blackmailed him. however, he probably shouldn't have tried to buy literal cp soooooo",11
"a marine returns from duty in iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in afghanistan.. that evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.

as he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.

the next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. at the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.

as the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! the naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.

confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...

""these men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over afghanistan."" he says, ""instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive allah's justice, then return home.""

the marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.

after 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.

""hey, my last post was in korea, how is it here?"" asks the replacement. ""and what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?""

"by lending a hot girl my fav hoodie. this sad tale literally just came to its bitter end.

so until 20 minutes ago i owned a gorgeous, bright yellow death grips hoodie that was my pride and joy. my mum bought it me for christmas last year and it was my absolute favourite item of clothing.

last night i went out with my mates and happened to meet an attractive spanish girl who was just in manchester for the weekend. we chatted for a bit and made out in the club smoking area as one does, then after a while she complained about the cold english weather. i predictably offered her my precious hoodie at this point. fast forward a few hours and we exchange contact details as we planned to meet the next day to hang out, then she leaves the club. i realise she's still wearing the hoodie so run after her and ask for it back. 

this is where i make my fatal error, a fine example of thinking with your genitals instead of your head. i had the smart idea that if i let her keep the hoodie for the night, itll mean she has to meet me the next day and can't back out thus allowing me more time to charm her. i essentially used the jumper as fishing bait but didn't think that the fish could just eat said bait and swim away. *spoiler alert* this is what happened. 

the next day i awoke excited to spend some time with this girl and waited patiently for her to reply to my messages so we could arrange to meet. by 5 in the evening i start to get worried and message her again as well as asking her friend to reply to me. my messages get left 'seen' for about an hour before they both block me on all social media platforms shooting in the head any chance of me seeing my beautiful jumper ever again. 

to the spanish girl who stomped on a nice gesture and on my heart, know that you have made me sad. 

rest in peace sweet banana coloured hoodie x

tl;dr lent a hot girl my best jumper in an attempt to guarantee more courtship time, girl steals hoodie

"by not knowing courtrooms had dress codes.. for those of you that are as unaware as i am, don't wear shorts, flip flops, or hats into court. i went to go pay a ticket (expired tags) at my scheduled time and saw ""no shorts, flip flops, hats, untucked shirts..."" in bold letters on the door. fortunately for me, the front desk had extra slacks on hand for this very thing. unfortunately for me, the slacks were a size 32, and i haven't been a size 32 since high school... i'm a big guy who's been ""blessed"" with thick thighs (heard they're in style). these slacks were so tight, i couldn't zip them past the first rung. all i could do was throw my belt on, cinch it tight, and throw my shirt over it all to hide the undesirables. these things looked like yoga pants on me.

i'd guess about 30 people were in the court room, spread out amongst the benches. i was capable of slipping behind everyone without them seeing and sitting on the back bench. one lady enters right before go time and asks me to scoot back so she could get by. i said ""ma'am, if i bend my legs i'll bust these pants wide open."" she looks down, sees my pants and starts snickering, then steps over me. 

after the judge said his speech, he began to call people 1 by 1 as they said their plea. he allowed us to stand where we were and shout our plea towards him (win). everyone before me requested a conference. i was fourth to be called. 

judge: ""qtvain how do you plea?""

me: ""guilty, sir. i would just like to pay my ticket.""

judge: ""alright, that's 100 dollars, please step up to the front, sign this document and the officer will escort you to the cashier.""

me: *panicking* ""uh yes, sir""

as i'm waddling up to the front, it really dawned on me that i looked like a bum off a three day bender. flip flops (that were clearly not allowed), the tightest pants you've ever seen on a man, and an untucked t-shirt. i'm starting to hear people fighting back laughter as i walk by every damn bench.

judge: ""didn't meet the dress code huh?""

me: ""sir, these people behind me know more about my body than i do right now. i'd really like to pay my ticket and go.""

judge: ""ha, fair enough. get outta here.""

i waddled out of there as quickly as i could and threw my shorts on in the bathroom. told my wife what happened when i got home. ""yah i thought it was weird you went into court with shorts, i was going to tell you but forgot.""

""thanks babe.""


tl;dr check your local courts dress code before attending. i didn't, and wore the wrong attire. 

edit: hey y'all, i get it. i should have thought about it. i'm just your standard law-abiding citizen who has never experienced the inside of a courtroom before. can we not be so hostile? i was just trying to show the judge a little leg.

edit 2: i'm trying to respond to all of y'all asking me questions. to further clarify, i thought i had to show up to the courthouse to pay the ticket, i didn't actually believe i had to see the judge. i was headed to work after the visit, and my job has a really, really lax dress code. hope this helps, my fingers are getting tired.

edit 3: thank y'all for the gold! i've honestly enjoyed chatting with so many of you. reddit, you're beautiful (even the random little shit stains that comment). i tried to respond to as many of you as i could. my fingers are actually hurting now. i'll comment more tomorrow. ",4

"employer keeps changing pay/benefits during the hiring process? is this a red flag? how to do i respond?. orginally i was quoted a salary of 97k. i accepted. later, in an email, i was told that was a mistake and that my actual salary would be around 75k. they said ""i hope this doesnt impact your decision to work for us"". 

i told them it did impact my decision. i told them this was my dream job but that i have offers for up 120k so i am definitely not accepting 75k.  finally after much negotiation, we settled on a salary of $94k and $10k per year student loan repayment (for up to 60k for 6 years). 

now, months later, i am filling out the loan repayment paper work and the hr lady emails me again saying they made a mistake and that after reivenstigation of policies the student loan repayment is only going to be a total of 10k over 3 years. and the full 60k will not be reached until 8 years.

"i'm miserable at my $55k/year job. i have the opportunity to work at a fast growing tech startup for $40k/year. is the switch worth it?. backstory: i was wildly successful at a full time retail commission sales job. i made a switch when one of my clients asked me to work for his energy conservation startup. he falsely marketed the job to me--sold me on an internal sales position and i'm currently doing everything but sales. at the time it seemed like a good idea because i was willing to do anything to get out of my toxic retail job.

the company does not have an internal sales team, he is spending more in lawyer fees than the residual monthly income (witholds commissions from contracted brokers...they sue him), and i cannot see it going anywhere despite his strong-willed forward thinking enthusiasm. note: there are vc investors who see a lot of potential in the company...i don't get it.  i've been in the position for four months--almost fired twice (my boss realized i wasn't closing sales even though my workload was geared toward everything but sales)--saw two employees (bosses he had me train, to be my boss...) come and go because he is impossible to work for. think donald trump temperament with complete inability to reason with people.

here's the catch. he's given me some serious raises in the course of 4 months. i'm currently at $55k/annually...24 years old...with a college degree. but actually no clue wtf the future of this job has in store for me. it could be super successful by some act of god and i'm in a great position to reap the benefits if this does happen. it might happen in a year...it might happen in five...it's hard to tell. at this point i'm bound by the salary.

i have the opportunity to jump ship and work as an sdr for a fast growing tech company. i'd be starting from the bottom with a lot of college grads willing to take a $40k/year salary because it's their first real job and they're enthusiastic as hell to climb the ladder of tech sales.

my boyfriend just moved in with me...brought rent from $1650 to $1100. i am less worried about not affording living expenses and more worried about my future. i can make the lifestyle adjustments...i think. i've gone from $70k/year in retail sales, $55k/year in a startup setting with zero direction and utter chaos solely because of the owner, to considering $40k/year just to start from scratch in an industry that could offer some serious longevity.

the tech position has a lot of upward career trajectory...but this pay cut is hard to wrap my mind around (approx. $15k!!!) . i do not have kids or a mortgage...part of me thinks this is the only chance i'll get to start fresh in a fantastic industry. the other part thinks i'm throwing away the (confusing) hard work i've put in and settling for a common entry level position with little leverage to negotiate. i probably won't see the money i'm making now for a few years.

please advise!!!

edit 3: the reason my rent only decreased by $550/mo after my boyfriend moved in is because i live in a 400 square foot studio and gave him a drawer for his 15 articles of clothing and a corner for his guitar and katana. the spacial distribution is definitely not 50/50 lol. he's inspired by netflix's ""minimalism"" documentary.

"my boss never approves my work if she thinks its a first draft...so now i lie. i do all the marketing for the company \(making literature, website design, adverts\).

then one day i went into her office with my brochure and i used the word second draft...my work was approved straight away.

suddenly a pattern emerged, if my boss thought that my work was a first draft, she would make changes to it, if she thought it had already been revised she would actually look at the design of the brochure and make constructive changes if needed.

so now i will always walk into her office saying ""would you mind reviewing this brochure, originally i had designed it like \*blah blah blah\* but now ive put it like this"", even if it is a first draft.

"when arguing, try restating the main point's of the other person's argument back to them and have them do the same with you. believe it or not, the vast majority of arguments are based on miscommunication.  

with arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.

1) not understand the other person's argument

2)  feeling that the other person does not understand your argument

3) convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument

4)  arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...

5) an unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument

...

next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  

something like, ""hold on, i want to make sure i understand what you are arguing. you are saying that xyz is broken and the only way to fix xyz is to get qrs to modify y so that it will fit better into z?""

now this has several benefits.  

--first and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.  this is huge because most arguments get so convoluted the people arguing don't even know what they are arguing about (and this goes double for emotional and relationship type arguments when the people have history together).  

--secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect

--thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually ""listen"" and ""hear"" what they are saying.

--fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.

you can also do the reverse.  pause the argument and ask ""can you tell me what my argument is?  can you explain the problem as i see it?

this forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    and again, it helps to actually help define the exact problem...",8

students are somewhat upset that they need to learn math or history when they are certain it will not come in use once they leave highschool. although they are(at least math) relevant to life out of school, if there is something that you can't argue about it's relevance and usefulness in the outside world, it's computer science.

"update my wife is going to gave sex with other men. sorry i posted this update in the wrong sub. here we go. my wife and i calmed down on sunday to discuss this mess. i had been avoiding her all week until i could get my head around it. we took a drive in the car, something we like to do for like 3 hours. my wife started out apologizing for how she presented this to me. she had been rehearsing on what to say. when it came time to inform me it just spilled out of her mouth all wrong. she wanted to bring up now that kids are grown and on their own, she would like us to make changes in our lives. she went on about not having other sexual partners etc. what she wanted to propose was that we have an open relationship, where we both would seek out others. 

i told her that i would not , could not do this. i reminded her of the vows before god, family and friends we took on fidelity. i told her how she had violated the trust that i had for her. look i understand what she is feeling. i know she wants new experiences. i told her our plan as we had discussed many times in the past, once the kids were out that we would travel a bit. maybe take up new hobbies, maybe some education classes etc. we never had a discussion about this. 

i told her because of the breach of trust and her steadfastly stating she is going to do this i was seeing a lawyer tuesday to start divorce proceedings. at this point if she said she would not go thru with this i do not think i could not think she could be cheating at some point. that is where the trust comes in. i think divorce is proper, she can do her thing no guilt can be associated. i think equal division of assests, i expect to make no support payments, did not know if it was a thing in our state, its not. we will have to sell the house and each downsize. we actually had a good talk. papers are being drawn. we hope  to get through this by fall.

i did talk to each kid individually, explained we are going seperate ways. did not mention the lifestyle change. they can talk to their mom themselves. i will always love my wife. i will take the high road. i know many of you wanted scortched earth but i can not do that, its not me. i do want to address a couple comments someone posted on the update on the other sub. they thought i was trying to manipulate her into staying by using the marriage vows. i got to say that my religious up bringing has set my morals that i live by. this works for me. there are some that say its the 21st century no one lives that way anymore. there are many things i see others do and say that i do not agree with, but i do not try to impose my morals on them and conversly you should not denigrate what i believe. remember my wife and i believed the same for close to 30 years, only recently has she made a change. i never held her down she was always free to chose. i believe in god and believe in my vows before him. sorry enough soap box.

last i want to thank all of your kind replies. i was overwhelmed. i only wish i could have replied to each and everyone. thank you for letting me talk this out.",7

"my daughter died years ago and it's still almost impossible for me to make it through father's day every year.. remorse

every year on father's day i put on a brave face and go to work. i talk on the radio all day to people i don't know and who will never see me and often they will wish me a happy father's day as a pleasantry when i ship them to the next frequency. i know they mean well and i'm gracious to them and thank them, but it cuts me to the core. 

most of my coworkers are male and many of them have young kids of their own. they show up to work with the silly crowns, stickers, cards, and mugs that their kids made for them at school on friday. i'm not mad about that and i don't fault them for wearing them...that's what dads are supposed to do when they have kids they love and who love them back. i loved my daughter and i still love her but she's gone and she can't love me back and it hurts. 

i don't want to hear commercials about father's day on the radio when i'm driving to work or home from work tomorrow. i don't want to have an internal argument with myself about how i ""should"" feel on father's day and whether not i'm ""really"" a father. i don't want my coworkers who know my story to awkwardly avoid talking to me all day and elbow someone who doesn't know my story when he brings out a picture of his kids to share with us. i don't want people to tread lightly around me...my pain should not affect their happiness. i don't want that--but i also don't want it to still hurt like it does. most of all, i don't want to come home to this empty house after work like i've done every day since my wife left 3 years ago. what i do want is my family back. 

my daughter was just a toddler. she never even got a chance. 

dads--please hug your kids today...and every day after today too. happy father's day. ",11

"daily use of the art of upod (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. tell your s.o. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.. under-promise, over-deliver (upod).  not new advice, i know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    these are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an m.d. ph.d. in neuroscience/neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, i under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).  

1.) realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). people often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them. 

2.) upod only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  you shouldn't tell your so that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.

3.)  **don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  if you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to ""offer"" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  this is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody's fault but your own.  first of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over upod with them again.  many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually opud (over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  you might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).  

4.) when starting out, **buffer upod with ""i wish"" statements**.  i have 4 kids, and with my m.d. ph.d. training, i literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  at the beginning of each school year, i remind my kids that although i wish i could make it to every event, i will not be able to attend everything. every time i show up, my kids are totally stoked.  i sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know i can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, i have found quite the opposite.  i have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that i say i will be at. 

5.) when employing upod, **focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  for instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with ""i really wish i could go, but i probably can't.  could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?""   when a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know ""i will check with the chef to see if i can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  however, i can bring you some free extra breadsticks that i can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.""   

6.)  **you can maintain an optimistic attitude while still upod-ing to yourself**.  i just realized that upod-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  i used to always tell myself that i would get more work/homework done over christmas vacation.  turns out, i was always disappointed at how much i actually got done.  now, before the break, i tell myself i will be happy to get 10 or so hours' worth of work done each vacation period. if i get more done, i am pretty proud of myself.   for instance, even though i spent about an hour putting this post together, i am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  this is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success i have, it is worth it (also, i plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).   

7.) **under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  teach them, in gentle ways, how to upod. 

8.) **in some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are upod-ing**.  example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a friday evening).  i say ""some instances"" because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  for example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  for instance, you don't need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.  

i apologize if this felt like a lecture, i just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before i had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, i am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of upod.

tl;dr:  under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.

"for not trading seats on a plane?. this happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought i was a bit rude, but i thought i was completely justified.


so we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. i figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so i booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


when we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he's very proud of it. then he asked if i could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. i was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. i honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. so we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" i answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


as i said my girlfriend said i was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

"my(28m) girlfriend(29f) said another mans name during an intimate moment. we've been together 7 years with a couple of short breaks during that time. over the past few months i've been getting a nagging feeling that something is not quite right with the relationship, as i've been trying to plan short trips or holidays all of which have been declined with the same response that she cannot afford any time off work. she is also very quick to close any messages on her phone if i enter the room.

this evening during an intimate moment she said the name of one of her male co-workers i confronted her on this and she flatly denied saying anything at all, but i have no doubts over what i heard. 

i took her home in what felt like the longest drive of my life. as i dropped her off i said i wanted to talk about what happened she just left without saying a word.

i went into 3d because i was passionate about it and really wanted to make a career out of it, hopefully to make a decent amount of money where i had a little freedom to save up for stuff. but after getting out of college i've come to realization of how savage the industry is and how it would be impossible for me to take a junior/mid level position in the states where most of the jobs are posted.

"by making a cash register boy blush. short but sweet, obligatory tl;dr at the bottom.

i (f 34) was on my way back home from work, passing by the local grocery store and supermarket, located very close to my home.there are normally lots of stray cats in the neighborhood, but there is one in particular that always comes running when she sees me, so even when i am loaded with shopping bags, i can't help myself petting her.today was no exception. i made sure to pet her only with the left hand, because i knew i wouldn't be able to wash my hands immediately (love her but she is kinda dingy), so to avoid touching my face or hair (as i often do), i was trying to do everything with my right hand.

so i go to the supermarket next, already on the cash register, unloading my basket and chit-chatting with the boy who works it (he looks to be in his early 20's, kinda cute), like i normally do.while i'm helping him arrange all items in my bag, i followed his gaze and noticed the questioning look he gave my left hand, as it must have appeared quite weird that i wouldn't use it, and instead hold it aside, like a surgeon ready to operate.me being the kind of person who feels the need to explain any misunderstandings away (because god forbid somebody thinks something weird about me, lol) chirp up casually:-oh, i just stroke a kitty with that hand, so i try not to touch anything else before i wash my hands properly.mind you, i said that in my native language, where the word for kitty and the euphemism are interchangeable, like *p.u.s.s.y* in english.

he stopped scanning the groceries for a moment and when i looked at him, he had this priceless expression on his face.... eyes a little wide, sort of flushed, looking at me in disbelief.only then did it hit me what i said and how it must have sounded to him.i quickly corrected myself, elaborating saying:-kitty. cat, you know. a stray. meow meow. (yes, i really said that....\*cringe\*)

he made an ""oooooh..."" sound and bit his lips suppressing a burst of laughter.

i think i might shop elsewhere in the next few days... \*facepalm\*

tl;dr: i accidentally woke somebody's dirty mind by making him think i've pet my kitty...

"for telling my boss his ""time theft"" concerns are not my problem?. the computers at my job are fairly crappy and require several minutes to boot. after turning them on i have to wait a couple of minutes for them to get to the password screen, then a few more minutes before they're all loaded up and ready to go. typically i come in, turn them on, check my phone messages, hit the head (long commute to work) then get going. it's around 5 minutes max.

so this morning he calls a meeting and announces that going forward he wants everyone there 10 minutes before their required start time in order to boot their machines and starts citing how much this so-called ""time theft"" is costing him and etc. i replied that if he wants me to come in at 8:50 instead of 9 that's fine, but the ten minutes has to come off the end of the day unless he's going to pay the 50 minutes of ot a week. i also pointed out that when he opens the building at 8am he could spend two minutes turning on everyone's (three people) computers, which would cut the wait time in half at least. then i said that my time is as valuable to me as his is to him and even though it's ""just ten minutes"" they're my ten minutes, not his and i'm not interested in donating my time for nothing.

he offered to comp the meal, but i said it wasn't necessary. i just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. the manager insisted that i was owed an apology. made sense to me at the time. she apologizes, gets her tip, i leave, everyone is happy. 

when the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. as soon as the manager saw this, he put on his ""you're about to get fired"" face. all the tears and pleading made no difference. it was ugly. people were filming with their cell phones. 

as she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think i'm the second coming of satan). the manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. 

when we got home, the wife claimed i was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding. i feel like all i did was share a legitimate complaint to the manager. she is the one who escalated it by rolling her eyes at us. am i being unreasonable? what would you have done in this situation?

"sister opened a student loan under my name 8 years ago.. like the title says, my sister (2 years older than me) opened a student loan in my name 8 years ago, just after i turned 18.

the only reason i found out was because i got a letter a few months ago from the servicer who holds the loan giving me the amount of interest paid on it last year for taxes. i thought it was a mistake at first but when i told my mom about it in passing a couple of days ago, she said she thought my sister had paid off the student loan. 

yesterday, i dug around a bit and found the letter, called the company, and found out i have about $15,000 more in debt to my name than i thought because of it. i'm going to be buying a house soon and i'd rather this just go away completely but the servicer insists i'm on the hook for it. for what it's worth, she's never missed a payment on it. what would i do in this case to get the loan company to make her responsible for it?

edit: i'm in wisconsin. to be clear, my parents didn't know about it and they are pretty pissed. my sister has a good job and i think she might be able to pay it all back in one go. she's literally never been in trouble with the law before and (before this) seemed like a great person. she graduated 3 years ago and the original amount of the loans was $65k, she's paid $50k in 3 years.",2
"if i report my doorman for calling me pretentious?. i moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. it's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. i always say a pleasant, ""hi, how are you? have a nice day/evening"" to them when i leave or enter the building, but i don't stop to chat to them as i have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200b;

one of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as i'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. i usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as i'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200b;

the other day he shouted out to me, ""come here, miss pretentious,"" so this time i turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""what did you call me?"" he then proceeds to say i'm pretentious and obviously think i'm better than everyone else in the building because i won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. his tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. i politely explained that it's not that i think i'm better than everyone but that i'm just really tired after work and want to go home. i also said i find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as i'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if i wanted to). he ended by saying that i won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if i keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. i told him (again, politely) that i wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and i then walked away.

&#x200b;

since then i have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""hello, miss pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as i walk into the building. i have completely ignored him both times.

&#x200b;

i feel like i should probably talk to him and tell him i don't appreciate being called that, but honestly i just want to report him to his supervisor as i'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and i feel like i shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building). so if i just go ahead and report him? i don't want to get him fired or anything, but i do want him to stop.",3

"my brother 19m and i 21m have reason to believe that our sister 16f is gay. she has been depressed for years, we have super religious parents who said that being gay ""won't work in this house"". how can i show support/help her without making her feel like she has to reveal anything to me?. i'll give you guys a bit of a background here. my sister has always been interested in ""male stuff.""  hanging out with my brother and i all the time growing up probably influenced that. however, she always dressed cutesy, was obsessed with bieber, did a lot of stuff that you'd ""expect"" from a girl. most of that was my parents, though. as she has gotten older, her style has changed, she has many lgbtq+ friends (this is not an assumption this is a fact). her closest ""friend"" is mary (fake name), who i'm pretty sure is her girlfriend. they spend the night with each other doing ""sleepovers"" 3-4 nights a week, 5-6 nights during this past summer. they always cuddle and are very loving toward each other. today was when i went from 75% sure to 90% sure that she is gay: my brother's friend, who is friends with siblings of my sister's friends, accidentally revealed in front of him that my sister is gay and backtracked and claimed to be joking, as they know that he is a friend of my brother.

my sister has acted quite sad and depressed for 2-3 years now. my parents are very religious (mostly my mom), and my sister even goes to a christian camp every summer which i think she actually enjoys. in fact, i think she is in a christian, but is conflicted about her orientation in relation to her beliefs. 

i feel as though that, if she were to come out, my father would be supportive, but my mother would not. my sister was willing to tell her friends that she is gay but not her own brothers who she knows she can fully trust?

i know i made a lot of predictions as to what is actually happening in the situation, but it's been stuck in my head. my sister never leaves her room, is gaining a lot of weight, and has the pressure of her sexuality on her mind. not to mention that her friends aren't that great.

"by accidentally giving my entire family an indirect unholy facial update. two days back, this(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ael0wt/tifu_by_using_holy_sanctified_oil_as_lube/) happened.
here's the **tl;dr** from it:
used oil as lube, accidentally shot semen into the bottle. turns out oil had religious incantations recited upon to ward off evil, and grandpa will be using it tonight on his hair and beard.

right after the post, a lot of people asked me to throw the oil away but i hesitated because my grandpa had apparently been feeling better ever since he started using the oil even before i came in it, so i didn't know how to waste it. i could've asked the imam (local mosque leader) to do the same stuff he did on the oil in a new bottle, but he's out of town for this month. so i just put the bottle where it was and he even used it once right after, unfortunately.

next two days, i stayed over at my cousin's place and just got back this morning. right as i came back, mom recommended me to massage my hair with the oil given by the imam as it felt ""soothing"". as she was saying it, i visualised my demonic jizz nuclei laughing and slowly sliding into the bottle, and then being mixed in it throughout. i snapped back, and acted like i wasn't convinced to do it. she told me it was my choice, and that everyone in the house (parents, grandparents and siblings) had done it and felt better. i rushed to the bathroom to check the bottle because i couldn't believe what she said, and the bottle was nearly empty with the slightly bubbly end left over for me. i froze over the realisation that each of my family member had used my mayonnaise infused sanctified oil on their faces and hair, and i haven't been able to look at any of them in the eye ever since i left the bathroom. 

not sure if i should tell my brother about this now, or keep my mouth completely shut at this point.

"by showing my friend nude pictures of his sister. this happened almost 4 years ago, but today it made me think about it.

backstory, i met this amazing girl at a party that some friends of mine were throwing.  it was a themed party, prep boy and school girls, and she was as kind as she was sexy.  we exchange numbers and proceed to texting and talking on the phone and went out on a few dates.

well, just like most relationships, i assume, she sent me a few sexy pictures of herself.  well one day, my buddy asks me about the girl i am dating.  i tell him about her and he asks about her body.  i show him a picture she took of herself laying out by the pool, neck down.  he grabs my phone and starts swiping.  before i can stop him he freaks out yelling ""that is my fucking sister!!!"" i then realize the picture he was looking at was one i took of her fully nude.  after that, he was not too happy about it, or me dating his sister.

but this story has a happy ending.  the reason i am posting this today, is because this is the one year anniversary of the day i married that wonderful woman, and that buddy was one of my groomsman.

and before anyone asks, no, she has no clue her brother saw a picture of her nude, i think she would be mortified if she did.

tl;dr: was dating a girl who turned out to be my buddy's sister, showed him a nude photo of her and he freaked out.

edit: since people are freaking out thinking i showed a nude picture on purpose let me clarify.  i showed my friend a picture of her in a bikini neck down that she took laying out by a pool.  she posted said picture on instagram as well as sent it to me.  i did not willingly violate her trust by showing him a nude picture of her.  apologies if my wording was off.

edit 2: thank you for the gold and silver, you guys are awesome!  also, since everyone asks how i didn't know she was my buddy's sister.  she and him have a common last name like smith.  and i did not know his sisters name.  when i told him i was dating a girl named ""jill"" (not her name) he didn't immediately think ""oh hey is that my sister."" because it is a common name.  and as for my wife, we had been dating for a little over a month.  when she said she had a brother, i didn't go ""oh what's his name, where does he work, what's his astrological sign.""  because i wanted to know her first, know her likes and hobbies.  i guess i could have dove more into questions about her family, but we weren't at the point of meeting each other's parents yet.  hope this helps with those questions, if it does not. sorry.  again thank you for all the kind words and happy anniversary comments.  you people are amazing!",4

in those 2 years we had ups and downs like in any relationship but to sum it up we always worked it out somehow and grew together more and more. 

fast forward to yesterday: we had been talking about what we wished for our future and at some point he just went ""i think we should break up when we leave college"". 
i was shocked because in every other conversation he seemed like he wanted to continue our relationship. 

the problem is: i really don't want to break up with him. 
i love him so much and i don't see the point in being in a relationship with someone who wants to break up anyway.

i tried doing some research, as it is an independently owned complex within a strata. there wasn't much to find. i called the human rights board in town, they told me i had a case. i called the tenancy branch and they informed me that i was not covered under the tenancy act, as, for the 8 days out of the month he stays here, we share a bathroom and kitchen.

he asked for the rent money early, two days ago. i was hesitant to, but obliged. that's biting me in the ass right now. he was fined 550$ for allowing to me to reside in the complex with a child, and is being asked to leave as well. he blames me for this, and refuses to refund next months rent because the fine is ""my fault for not keeping that damn thing quiet"". he knew full well that i had a young daughter (and a cat), though i was assured by him before moving in that neither would be an issue.

"by running with the school flag, tripping, and destroying the state championship trophy in front of the whole school.. so the mess up happened yesterday and i'm still saying ""oh my god"" to myself every time i think about it.

this past saturday our school's girls cross country team won state and because of that earned everyone a pep rally. the night before someone asked if anyone wanted to be the flag runner and i happily volunteered(https://i.imgur.com/qfllrsl.jpg), because that's a super dope job. i mean what could possibly go wrong?

well here is exactly what went wrong:
 
the pep rally is in motion. the cross country team starts pouring down from the stands to lead a school cheer. this is exactly when you should do a flag run, so i start haulin' out and narrowly avoid plowing one girl and make my way around the crowd (definitely wouldn't recommend to a friend now though). i am caught up in the buzz of the moment and then all of a sudden i'm going down hard...(https://i.imgur.com/xpl4p0i.mp4)
all that is going through my head is siren noises and me thinking ""i should just die now"" but unfortunately that never came to fruition and it got worse as i saw what i had tripped on and destroyed: the state trophy we just won and the one from last year!(https://i.imgur.com/gyagail.png)
now i'm a bit more famous around the school and kids keep seeing me in the hallway an saying ""omg! you're the kid who broke the trophy!!""

"some people are just plain stupid and should be given up on. i'm a tutor and a substitute teacher working on getting a full time credential. the mantra is always something about no child left behind or how every kid has potential to do good. 

no. some kids are just fucking stupid. 

i've tutored a high schooler who legitimately did not know what 2+2 was, and they weren't special ed or trying to be funny or anything like that. some people are just stupid and it's their own fault they fail, not the fault of anyone around them. no amount of extra hard work from their teachers or tutors will make them smarter. they'll always be stupid. they're the kids where you painstakingly walk them through every single step in solving a problem, and then for the next one they have no idea what to do even though it's the exact same problem with slightly different numbers or words, and then you repeat this process every day 5 days a week until it's summer break and you've gotten nowhere the entire time with them. 

they should be given up on. these people don't even want to succeed in academics. they're the ones talking about how you can't ask a fish to climb a tree to justify how it's okay that they suck at important life skills but they're semi decent at fortnite dancing and hot dog eating, as if the skills are comparable in value. not only are they so thick that their brain is locked behind an impenetrable brick wall, but they straight up don't even think an education is valuable so they don't give a shit anyways. it's a waste of everyone's time to force teachers to teach at the pace of the slowest kid, take time away from those who can learn to dedicate more time to the idiot, and to hire a tutor to try to magically make the idiot smarter. 

valuable time and resources dedicated to helping these failures shouldn't be given to them. that extra time should be spent working with the kids who actually can learn and want to learn. plenty of parents have thrown hundreds of dollars at me a month to make their kid smarter and get better grades, only for their kid to be completely hopeless. it was a waste of their money and i knew from the first day that their kid wouldn't learn shit from me. 

these kids just need to be left behind. it's not right to make everyone else worse off just to try to pour resources and time into a human who's brain is a bag with a hole in the bottom. 

edit: just wanted to point out that someone took the time to pm me and say i'm a dick and a toad because people make way more money playing fortnite and eating hotdogs than the $5 an hour he assumes teachers make. i'll just let that stand for itself. 

edit 2: just to clarify since i can't reply to hundreds of comments, what i am not advocating for is throwing these kids out on the streets. what i am saying is that right now the sole goal of our education system is to get kids into college. that should change. some kids aren't capable of that and that's okay. we should push some people into more realistic work and blue collar jobs instead of only trying to get kids to have a high enough gpa for college. give up on trying to teach a kid a life skill they won't use and try teaching them something else valuable to society.",6
"took husband to er for possible stroke and he got 5150/what can i do?. this is a long story because a lot happened and is still happening.

we live in seattle. my father in law died suddenly and we flew down to northern ca to deal with that. we decided to drive back. on the way, my husband started to say that he didn't feel right. his heart was racing, his face felt weird. he was on little sleep dealing with his family and we hadn't been eating great because of everything going on so this man who is normally pretty chill got flat out terrified that he was having a stroke.

we work for a pretty big and well known non-profit health care provider that pushes the whole kind of better safe than sorry thing when it comes to your health so...i googled the closest er and went to it.

we got there and, by this time, i'm pretty sure he's having a panic attack. he's not violent or threatening or anything, just really really scared he's about to die like his father to the point that he's making sure i know he doesn't want to be cremated.

i tell the check in person that he thinks he's having a stroke and i think it's a panic attack but i'm more worried about his heart. they check him in, he gets the code for the bathroom and goes to the bathroom. (in other words, he's not threatening anyone, he's not trying to kill himself, he's not unable to take care of himself.)

after he's available, the nurse takes him for triage. his blood pressure is 188/100, which is not normal for him. i tell the nurse this and that i'm very scared about what that means. she just shrugged it off. she asked him his height and weight and he answered. then she started to ask him all these mental health questions. when she would, he would look at me because...what the hell does that have to do with anything right now? his blood pressure is not right.

so i answer these questions to the best of my ability while pointing out his physical symptoms were a very big concern.

they take us back to what they call their er overflow. it ends up being psych. my husband keeps asking why he's there. they take that as he's unaware of his surroundings. he does as they ask and changes and such because it was pretty clear they had no intention of letting us leave.

he's not put in a room, just a cot with a curtain in a line of cots with curtains. we look around and notice things like...their trash bins are just lowe's lawn and leaf bags and they keep patient charts in three ring binders on a desk and they're accessible to anyone in the room.

where we work, the standard is you secure everything in a computer and patient information is guarded like state secrets. when dealing with patients, our medical staff asks them multiple identifiers no matter how many conversations they've had with that person before new information or new medical stuff has to happen.

these people came up to my husband and just said his first name then started to talk to him like they'd been friends for years. he refused. he let them know we expect a certain level of patient safety and we're not getting it. if they don't ask him his last name and birthday every time, he's not talking to them.

they took that and wrote it down as, ""paranoid.""

i explained to them the medical world we come from. they said it doesn't matter. they do things differently so the fact that he can't fall in line is an issue. they kept the ""paranoid.""

eventually, they got him a televisit with a psychiatrist but wouldn't tell us much about where this psychiatrist is based out of or anything. when he pops onto the screen, he just says his name and that's it. it looks like he's in his living room.

again, this is not what we are used to.

the psychiatrist asks my husband his name and his date of birth. my husband refuses to answer. he didn't agree to this, he doesn't feel medically safe, he doesn't trust what's going on. the psychiatrist spends all of five minutes not really trying and calls it a day.

at this point, i'm not worried my husband is having a stroke, but i am worried his heart is going to explode because of how they are treating him and how they're not even touching on his concern that he's having a stroke. he started to beg me to not let them let him die. then he started to try to go through at least the physical tests for signs of a stroke. the staff looked at him like he was this super sad insane guy and decided he needed ativan. because *i* was worried about his heart and i know the doctors i work with in my job prescribe it for some patients to feel ok with being in an mri machine, i talked him into taking it in hopes that he would at least not care that he's so worried about having a stroke.

eventually, we hear back that the psychiatrist on the tv who spent five minutes with my silent husband has decided he's bipolar, is having an episode, and needs a 24hour hold and anti-psychotic medication. 

what?!

so they start planning for him to be there for 24 hours.

i try to fight them, but they shut me down every step of the way.

meanwhile, the ativan is making my husband loopy. i look it up and...oh... it can cause hallucinations. spiffy. this is going to help our case.

the night wears on and they try to get my husband to take zyprexa. at this point, the ativan is wearing off but he's ok. he asks them if there's side effects with zyprexa. they laugh and shrug. all drugs have side effects according to the nurse. he declines to take it. they tell him they can't trust him to be released if he can't follow medical staff direction. he asks again if the medication is safe. they assure him it is. he reluctantly takes it.

a couple of months ago, his pcp back home prescribed him prozac. seattle gets funky around this time of year and, with him being from ca, the change in seasons can be hard. there's a lot of sad in the area from the ca transplants. his doctor wanted to be proactive.

this hospital knew he was on prozac.

they declined to tell us that prozac and zyprexa actually can interact.

and, of course, it did.

so now he's super out of it, talking nonesense, suddenly becomes worried that he's peed himself. they try to take blood from him and his blood is so jacked they barely get anything. and everything just starts to to downhill from there. eventually, they feel like i'm asking too many questions and being disruptive and kick me out then put him on a 5150 and he's been stuck there with no clear way out. i talked to the mental health person that put the 5150 in motion and she would not budge. she was adamant that my safety was in jeopardy. i told her i'm not scared of my husband and, that, once they stop giving him those meds, he won't have the symptoms he's having. she stated that she can't because of his paranoia that his identity is going to be stolen. i pointed to the open binders on the desk of patient information and said, ""you're handing it out to people here. he's completely justified."" but they do it differently and, because he can't file in line with that, it's a really big issue. they had no intention of letting him go.

keep in mind, too, they'd ask, ""you have xyz insurance, right?"" before deciding what sorts of things they're going to throw at him. he has excellent insurance.

this is a small rundown of what i know has been done to my husband:

they have ""accidentally"" given him his prozac prescription twice a day when he just takes a dose once a day. they keep giving him the zyprexa on top of it and he keeps having side effects.

i have seen no paperwork about anything happening to him. no consent forms. nothing. when i asked for a copy of the 5150, first they couldn't find it then they said i need to ask medical records. it's the weekend. this place is dead on the week outside of the er. not happening.

i got in contact with our home medical team. the doctor in charge of his care told our rn he's not talking to her and hung up. (our rn is now working on putting him through the wringer.)

they refused to let me see him for an entire day. i'm going to try to see him today, but i'll probably get escorted out again. i'm walking a fine line of not getting out right banned from the hospital.

there is no patient advocate in staff, no ombudsman. no social worker.

all the lawyers in town take the weekend off so i can't get a lawyer. i talked to my police team back home because they're good people and they suggested i call the police here to do a wellfare  check. the police here wouldn't do it.

i brought my husband in for a stroke and now they're giving him meds he didn't really agree to take, his reaction to those meds are giving them a medical excuse to not release him, and no one here will help me.

what do i do? how do i get him out?

update
i'm getting a lot of the same responses about certain things so i'd like to add:

we work in health care. the place where we work requires at least two patient identifiers before we are even allowed to start talking to the patient. i get that it's probably not standard in most of the country, but our high level of care that receive from our company isn't either. we calmly explained why we balked. they couldn't humor him. the more zombie they make him the more his extensive training for his job makes him silent. like we say, if we haven't pissed you off making sure you're you then we haven't done our job.

my husband has signed that i can know his medical stuff and make medical decisions on his behalf.

he thought he was having a stroke and no one was addressing those concerns so he was scared he might die from a stroke. i work with neurology patients. his reaction was not inconsistent with my experience.

part of our situation is stemming from we are used to x level of care and professionalism and, apparently, that's an anomaly. but, no, i'm not going to let him be penalized because he expects a certain standard that all people should expect. when we spoke to our personal medical staff about the reasonableness of him keeping quiet because they don't do what we do, they consistently say they wouldn't talk either because that's not safe.

there are ways for staff to validate the staff from other medical facilities.

we are working on getting a lawyer. i called them and they won't say anything past he's sleeping and that he's not allowed visitors.

update

they have *lost* the forms he signed giving me clearance to speak on his behalf and cut off communication.  his mother contacted them and they told her that he has been re-evaluated and his hold has been extended another 72 hours they state because he is unresponsive and suicidal. his first hold went into effect 12/7/2018 at 12:22pm.  today is not 72 hours.  there was no hearing that we know of.  his mother got them to let me call them.  i called him.  he stated that he wants to live, but he needs help.  i asked him with what.  he stated that he's too weak to feed himself and get himself water and they won't help him with that and he feels like he's starving.  i did tell him to ask them so let's hope that happens.

edit to add: he has been getting up to wander around loopy and the guards rush him and grab him to bring him back to his bed. there's no warning. he tenses from being startled then lets them lead him around like a puppet. they call this aggressive behavior from him. maybe that is aggressive in an er. in a normal world, that's not. and just because something has been a certain way for a while doesn't mean it's right. it might just mean no one has said anything.

i also do not think my husband isn't ill and i don't have any issue with him having a mental illness.  he's my husband and that's not going to change.  i just want him in a better care facility closer to home and they are not letting me do that. since their beds are so full, you'd think they'd jump at it. 

further edit: 

i was driving. we had stopped for a moment and he stated he was worried, can we go to a hospital.

for the first 36 hours, i didn't say anything and let him handle it for the most part while i did everything they asked without complaint, but when we got there it was shift change and he had about ten different people in and out. 

his blood was not flowing well and his veins had shrunk. it was jacked up. 

the rn trying to get through was using the official lines as her job is patient transport and care tracking. the hospital would not speak to her to set up care tracking and transfer. 

his doctor prescribed him prozac because he went to her and said he was feeling off with the season change. she wasn't ready quite yet to diagnose sad but prescribed the medication to see if that makes a difference.

the area he's in is technically just er overflow and there isn't an actual psych ward area. they just put a privacy screen up as a barracade in an area with extra cots.

i never said i was a provider or a nurse. the whole point of that was that i told them he's requesting these wacky to them things out of them because we work for a healthcare company. i asked them to humor him. they said they don't do things that way. he still jumped through their hoops, just informed them he didn't think it professional every time. once he got to know the person, he didn't do it. it was just when it was someone new. since he hasn't had the same team twice yet, there's always someone new.

i apologise if my fear for my husband and his situation didn't make my writing clear and offended basically everyone. i actually wrote all this out, realized i had done that, then tried to back out of it, but got that...null error thing so figured it was lost anyway. i was surprised when i suddenly had a notification of a response. by then...it was what it was and a few people groked my intent and gave me some good advice. everyone else had a great time at target practice.

"i confiscated my son's weed and then smoked it. let me start by saying my son is a very good kid.  he's a high school senior who gets mostly a's, he works a part-time job, and he doesn't get into trouble. so when i found a bag of weed in his pants pocket one morning while preparing the laundry, it came as quite a surprise.  i had no clue he was getting high.

flash forward an hour.  i'm in my backyard, chatting to arlene my neighbor, about what i found.  arlene has four kids, all grown and out of the house, and she's my go-to for parenting advice.  i ask her what i should do. she says, ""let's smoke it!""

i couldn't believe i was doing it, but 20 minutes later we were in arlene's kitchen smoking weed out of a tobacco pipe.  i hadn't smoked pot since college. we got really, really high and we giggled for hours in her kitchen, making and eating all kinds of food and dancing to the radio.  it was so much fun!

when my son came home from work that evening i saw him go into the laundry room, where his pants were folded along with the rest of his clothes, and take the basket upstairs.  he never does that, so obviously he was looking for his weed.  a bit later i called him down for dinner and we had a normal meal and conversation.  i sensed some relief when the meal was done and he went back to his room.

i still haven't decided what to say to my son.  meantime, arlene has the rest of the weed and i will have no regrets...unless she smokes it without me!

"by smashing some girls teeth as a first impression.. edit: just for a bit of clarity on the situation. i offered to pay as much as i could and she kindly said no it's all good.

i should have been more specific, her two front teeth were both really badly chipped to the point that you could barely see the base of the teeth there.

she's upset about the whole thing but has a very positive outlook on it, i've offered to help cover payments but she has politely declined.



this just happened a couple hours ago. just a bit of context to start out. 

i'm moving into a flat with some great people in a couple of months and they invited me around for a few drinks as it was one of their birthdays. it was a bunch of about 20 of us and it was kind of a who knows who type situation.

it was a great time, everyone was getting along well, quite a few drinks, dancing, the usual stuff. met this girl called jess (not real name) and we got talking and she had the most amazing teeth and smile i've probably ever seen. 

fast forward a couple of hours and we are all heading home, i'm pretty bad with women so classic me i don't make a move and just start walking home. it's about a 20 minute walk across town so nothing too bad but not ideal.

we leave at the same time and we find out we can kind of walk halfway home and split ways there. we're stumbling along with some playful banter and she jokingly tries to trip me up, i'm drunk but not that bad so i manage not to slam the concrete.
in return i jokingly trip her up and here's the tifu. she falls like a 20 metre tall tree straight as a pole and slams the concrete. i feel so bad and instantly picked her up, she has a bloody nose and i'm freaking out because i've just slammed this gorgeous girl into the ground.

she gets up, asks is her face okay and as she says it, i see her two front teeth are both missing. my heart sank. i felt terrible. never felt so bad in my life. i let her know the situation and she bursts out crying. 

i call an ambulance and we got to a&e where we sit for 4 hours waiting to be seen to be eventually told go home and go to the dentist tomorrow. in the 4 hours we did get to know each other relatively well considering the situation. i had a mixture of feeling terrible but also how the fuck does this happen. you only ever hear of these stories

i pay for the taxis home as it's the least i can do and take her in and she invited me in for a tea with her face still fucked up. we chat for a couple hours about random stuff and as i leave i say it'd be cool to hang out sometime and she actually agrees to it once but once her face is in better shape

"for cutting my mother out of my life for letting me be homeless?. back in 2009 when the economy tanked i lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. basically everything. at first i didn't want anyone to know what had happened so i stayed at a friends house for a week while i looked for a new job. but his landlord told me guests couldn't stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. so i asked my mother if i could stay with her while i looked for a job. i told her i'd be on the street homeless if she didn't help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. fast forward 2 months, i've been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. even something like safeway or mcdonald's. my dad finds out that i'm homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in nj and i accept. within a week i have a job and in 3 months i'm in my own place again. it's been 10 years since then and i haven't spoken to my mother because of what i perceive to be a betrayal. she attempts to contact me frequently and i ignore it. for cutting her out of my life? 

tl;dr mother let me be homeless and i never forgive her.

edit: i have already cut ties. i haven't spoken to her in 10 years. it's my siblings telling me that i am the asshole that prompted this post.

edit: people keep asking for her reasoning and all i can say is what she said to me. she said she couldn't afford to let me stay. but all i was asking for was a place to sleep. not money, or food. i was getting a small unemployment check and eventually i got food stamps. i could have contributed. 

edit: i guess i also have to say that i never asked my parents for anything. i've earned everything i have. i am not a drug user and i have never been. i don't drink and i've been the most responsible of all the children. oh and my post should probably be she let me stay homeless instead of let me be homeless.",3

hello, it's me. sorry about the new username, i made the first account thinking i would just post & read the replies, so i couldn't remember the password as it was just a jumble of letters. didn't expect so many responses, thanks for your insight everybody!

&#x200b;

it seems folks were split on whether i was being: 1) an arrogant dick, or 2) completely clueless. i think it was probably a little of both. after spending years of slogging by in medical school living like a student, making so much money does really excite me, and i probably came on too strong with offering to buy her everything. it wasn't meant to be condescending, i just want to share my newfound wealth with the people i care about. but, as many of you said, it was patronizing to try and solve her issues with money and to throw it around like it means nothing to me. in the future, i will be a bit more mindful of money can cause a power imbalance in relationships. 

&#x200b;

this is kind of a non-update, but i wanted to at least thank everyone for the help and tell you that i will take your advice and ease up a bit. i don't want to make her uncomfortable and feel like she's indebted to me. a couple of you suggested a take a page from her book and learn how to budget myself, so yesterday i texted her and asked if she could help me, and she said (and i quote), ""yes, of course! budgeting is fun, you'll love it!""

&#x200b;

color me skeptical. but she clearly knows what she's doing, and, knowing her, she probably will make it fun!

"for not telling my sister about my nephew's new ""boyfriend""?. last year i took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. i'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but i felt it was important. i should also note that i left the church of latter day saints (mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of utah. it's part of the reason i am divorced. 

anyway, last night i took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his ""boyfriend"" there. i put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. in my family they would refer to it as ""crushing on each other"" instead. the ""boyfriend"" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying ""nothing better than hanging out with the people i love."" i thought it was innocent enough. he never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).

my sister is furious. she said that she should have been notified that he was dating. when i told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. here's the thing though. there is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. now that she knows he's gay i don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. 

i also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. i have legal guardianship over my nephew. he's living in my home. she kicked him out. she started crying after i said this and told my family so i've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person i am for saying that to my sister. i don't see it but maybe i'm wrong. should i have told her even though they aren't serious? was it a low blow to say the things i said to her? am i the asshole?

edit: thanks everyone. i feel like an asshole now for asking this question. it probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing i ever had to do and i think i still carry a lot of guilt from that. my kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. to have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. i don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.

edit2: i completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. i want to be super clear that wasn't what i intended to do. when you grow up in the environment i did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. everything i did from the time i started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. going against my family automatically makes me feel like i am messing up. when i picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that i messed up. when i divorced my husband and left utah and my family stopped speaking to me, i thought i messed up. it has taken years to overcome what i have been taught and i am not a confident person. i let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. every decision i make is harder for me than it is for most people. i am sorry if anyone feels like i am being anything other than genuine.",3

to make things complicated her family has never really approved of me. i know very basic korean that she taught me, but her family up until now has cut contact with me (they didn't come to the wedding, nor have they seen their grand daugthers). however she has always been extremely independent, and despises the idea that her family can control any part of her life, so she asked me to marry her (i was fine with that) only after living together for 8 months. 

two years ago she gave birth to a pair of wonderful baby girls. however it became very obvious something was extremely wrong, she became a whole different kind of person after the birth. she became extremely protective and borderline paranoid of anyone other than me or her looking after her kids. 

apparently the idea of her becoming a stay at home mom was insulting to her and she told me over and over that i needed to become a stay at home dad. since she was the bread winner it was fine for me. about 6 months ago she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and was given medication that made her much better (no more bizarre mood swings, or picking fights for no reason). 

last weekend was the first time i have had some time off from the kids, i was going to my friends bachelor party at his cottage for the weekend and my wife was going to look after the kids. 

on sunday morning i got a phone call from my sister who told me:

* my wife dropped the kids off with her as there was some emergency at the office on saturday.
* she didn't come back to get them and it was now sunday
* her phone wasn't responding to her messages/calls. 

i freaked out and rushed home, only to find pretty much all her stuff gone. she left me a single page note that was basically told me that she was going back home to be with her family, and she was ""cutting ties"" with me as she couldn't be the person ""i wanted her to be"", and asked that i respect her decision. she also closed our joint bank accounts saying i had ""no right"" to that money as she earned it. 

i talked to one of her friends from work and she said she told me she put in her two weeks notice over a month ago so this has been planned for awhile.

i am pretty much a confused mess, my family is helping out, but its complicated. i talked to her parents and they basically refused to talk to me, and demanded that i leave her or them alone. i brought up their grand-children and her father told me point blank they aren't his.

"because i refuse to spend money on my ex's kids despite being well off?. i have a 16 year old son and he has 4 half siblings who are all younger than him. i was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. 

obviously that didn't work out because she got pregnant (i did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, i'm a dad now anyway)i asked her to abort, she told me she'd changed her mind, and she kept the baby.

i wasn't thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established i set about paying child support and that was it. i had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and i was still a kid myself.

after a few months though i felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so i put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and i'm so glad and grateful that i got to be his dad.  i was 18 when i had him, and over the years i was lucky enough that i was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so i'm able to give my son experiences that i never had. 

he chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he'd always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he'd get yelled at because he's the oldest, etc. 

his mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. she is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. 

it was his birthday last week and as a gift i bought him a car, which he'll be needing soon anyway and which i've had the cash aside for for *years*. when his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me i that i'm a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because i've 'never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it's obvious his dad is spending money on him' ... i snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids i have no obligation to just so she doesn't feel bad? 

she said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that i was selfish for having a fund for only my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. i told her that's an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is.

"minimum wage just raised to $14, how can i bring up a relevent raise to my pay?. the wordings a bit rough, but essentially minimum wage just went from $11.40 to $14 (in ontario, canada). i have a job as an analyst in a lab, and my starting pay was $14 (before the wage went up). after 3 months, it was automatically going to be re-negotiated to $14.50 (which will be sometime this month), but now i'm wondering if i can try for something that reflects the current minimum.

 how can i go about bringing this up to my boss? how would i even word it, or argue for it? 

edit: hey everyone! thank you so much for sharing your advice! i can't believe this exploaded the way it did, but i honestly appreciate each and every comment. to do a mini update, here's my plan of action : **nothing!**

not in a bad sense however! i recognize this is in inopportune time for such a talk, and that my value as a worker does not necessarily reflect upon what others around me make. rather, its a reflection of what i bring to the table, and should be compensated accordingly. now, this beind said, staying in this job isn't my long term goals. i'll let the dust settle, garner as much experiance as i can in this field, and polish up the ol'resume to start finding a career that suits my needs and pays me the good monies.

 its known where i work that you have to fight for every cent, which isn't really my forte, nor do i wish to do so. i'll work my way up to the next level of analyst (intermediate requires 2-3 years exp), and cast my net out in search of greener lands (heres looking at you big pharma), but damn if i won't be sending out resumes all the while. 

again, thank you all for the advice! i really appreciate it, and wish y'all a happy new year! please accept a photo of my cat, her ladyship, nori, as an appeasment for the fact that i can't get around to replying to everyone : https://imgur.com/gallery/8wh4h",10
"my friend gave me a pet who died in the next day. i never told him and i pretend to have the same pet.. disclaimer: english is not my first language, so...

during my early teens i was best friends with a guy who had a couple of cockatiel's (domestic birds). i, an obssessed animal person, used to say that i would die for one of these birds  since i found them so pretty. lo and behold: in my 15th birthday my friend gave me one sweet baby cocktiel.

i was so happy with my baby bird, however i didn't had the tools to properly take care of it since my family and i didn't know we were getting one. also, i didn't know how i felt about domestic birds since they don't get to be free in nature (even though they don't know how to survive in the wild).

the first hour of my cocktiel at home was stressful  since my oldest dog didn't love the idea of a new family member and was trying to kill it in every opportunity. after some time, things got calmer and my mom had the idea of leaving the baby bird locked in the bathroom, so my dog couldn't find it. we were planning to get a birdcage and a bunch of cocktiel's toys in the next day so our baby would be comfortable.

next day in school, i was telling my friend how much i loved his gift and he told me about his own birds. he really loved them, and for him to give me one was a big demonstration of affection. i felt pretty great about my relationship with him and the cocktiel was a symbol to our love. he wasn't a guy who expressed feelings with words and at that point (us being friends for 10 years) he giving me the cocktiel was the first time he expressed that he trusted me.

so, it is the second day of my baby bird home and i notice that she was (yea, i decided that she was a girl) getting pretty smart around the bathroom, jumping next to the toilet and bathroom box. i didn't thought about that much since i was getting her birdcage soon, but warned my brother to always leave the toilet seat down, afraid that she was going to slip and fall in the water. then, i went to my afternoon class.

when i returned home, first thing i went to do was check my little cocktiel. yeah, you guessed it. she was dead. drowned in my brother's piss. he forgot to leave the seat down. i had a full breakdown, tried to ressuscitate her but no success. and then i thought about my friend and freaked out even more. i begged while crying to my mother to fix things.

the day after her death i wasn't in school, i went to my local pet shop and bought a baby cocktiel, now with a birdcage and all. i couldn't brought myself to tell my friend that my cocktiel had died in my brother's urine. my friend visited my house regularly so a new baby cocktiel was the only option for me. this happened years ago, i never told my friend the truth. only me, my mom and my brother knows that our cocktiel is a fraud. 

i'm so sorry betty lou i. i wish i had been better for you. rip",11
"for being upset about a ""prank"" my girlfriend pulled on me?. this past friday, my girlfriend and i had a small get together at our apartment where i proceeded to get very drunk. i'm not a very experienced drinker. my girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. the next morning, i wake up very hungover and thirsty. i see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says ""water"" on it. i thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? very thankful that i didn't have to get up to get water, i proceed to chug the ""water"" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. at that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. 

i felt very bad, i didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so i got up and cleaned everything up even though i felt like dog shit. she denied putting the ""water"" there so i just thought one of our friends did it. it was a shitty thing to do, but i got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. it shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says ""hair of the dog"" then howls.

i confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. i told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. it was a very cruel thing to do. she said i was overreacting and being sensitive.

edit: i really don't think she lied. i think she probably did it in a blackout.",3

"given incorrect dose of allergy shot, went into anaphylactic shock and health provider refuses to cover my expenses. what to do?. i've been getting allergy shots for close to 2 years and have been at a maintenance dose for more than a year (receiving the same concentration) .

my regular visit usually goes like this: nurse asks me preliminary questions, shows me vials of various concentrations (blue - 1:10000 concentration, yellow - 1:1000 concentration, red - 1:100 high concentration), verifies the vial to be administered, verifies my name and date of birth on the vial, then proceeds to administer the shot. i wait 30 minutes to ensure that no major allergic reactions occur. during my maintenance dose, i usually receive 1 ml of the yellow vial.

during this visit, my regular nurse i usually get my shots from was gone. the substitute nurse did not ask me the usual preliminary questions, did not verify my name/date of birth on the vial, had the syringes pre-loaded with the allergy shot serum and proceeded to administer the shot. i look at the counter where the vials are usually placed and all i saw were only the red vials, which is 10x the concentration i usually receive. i didn't think of anything since the other vials might've been placed somewhere else. so i begin the 30 minute waiting period.

after 20 minutes of waiting, i feel really flush, itchy, and hot. i begin to suspect that the red vial was administered to me. the nurse checks up on me, i tell her that i'm getting a reaction. she puts her hands to her face, sighs, then mumbles ""why me?"". i tell her she might've administered the red vial to me since it was the only vial i saw on the counter and she denies that she had given that to me. at this point, i'm going into analphylactic shock. the nurse calls a doctor and another nurse, administer an epi-pen, and call the ambulance to send me to the er. the allergic reaction subsets after 5 hours in the er.

i filed a grievance with the clinic manager to see if i could get all my expenses covered however they couldn't conclude that they had given me the incorrect dose. this is close to $2000 in out of pocket expenses after insurance. i request my medical records and see that there is no clear evidence of what concentration was administered to me. i look at the ambulance emt notes, and they noted i was given double the allergy shot dose.

3 weeks after my allergic reaction, i go in to get another allergy shot and my main nurse notifies me that it was charted i was given the 1ml of the  red - 1:100 high concentration dose. this doesn't appear in my medical records for the day of my appointment, it doesn't even show what i was administered on that day. now i want to take legal action against the clinic however i have no idea where to start, what to do, and how to approach the situation. any advice is appreciated. thanks!

"update blind furry sexually harassing me at work. fl. https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8zaehq/blind_furry_sexually_harassing_me_at_work_fl/

sorry for another update so soon, not good news. i'm an idiot. 

last night i called one of the numbers provided to me and spoke to one of the employee assistance people, who assured me that they'd get back to me.

i had a short shift this morning, and he came in right at the start, which he often does. i bought a mini spiral notebook at the dollar store and recorded the time and exactly what he said/did as someone told me to do a few minutes after he left when there was a lull in people coming in, and my manager came and saw and asked me what i was doing. he didn't press me or anything but i was dumb and told him what was happening and that i was just recording it ""just in case"" (again i've already told him about that customer and he basically ignored the problem and told me to do that too). he didn't comment on it at the time beyond saying ""oh"".

i woke up from a nap less than an hour ago and just checked my texts and he sent me a text telling me not to come into work tomorrow and that my services wouldn't be needed anymore. i'm freaking the hell out. i won't be able to find another part-time job that fits my schedule, i won't be able to move out of this fucking town. i feel like i'm going to puke. i'm so pissed at that dude and my manager and myself for not doing the notebook later. 

i was told to edit this to formally add a question or i wouldn't receive advice? i mean, just what's the best thing to do from here. thought it was obvious i meant that, sorry. thanks.

i want to thank everyone on this sub for posting your stories and advice. even though i haven't posted any of my own stories, a lot of the advice that's tossed around on this sub has indirectly helped me in big ways. you guys are awesome!

"by trying to be my boyfriends hero. sorry in advance for mobile formatting.

so this happened yesterday night, here is some context.

i am a serial sprainer, in the 4 years my boyfriend has lived with me, i have sprained my ankle 7 times. i have tripped random stupid crap, dog toys, a rock in the grass, stairs, anything my ankles can find they will try to kill me on.

my boyfriend is always there, coddling me and nurturing my softball heels. i always thought one day i will be there to nurture his aches when he would fall.. but he never fell.

in the four years we have lived together he has never once slipped on ice, tripped on a rock, tumbled over an ottoman, or even dragged his foot across some slippery water.

that was until yesterday.

we were uber eats delivering in the lazy snowfall we had in kansas, thinking we might get some decent tips. we delivered to this townhome complex, he got out to deliver while i stayed in. on his way back to the car his phone chimed for another delivery. he pulled out his phone, and instead of paying attention down he went on a patch of ice.

he didn't fall and crack, he fell down with enough grace to land on his butt and his elbow. still, beggars can't be choosers. 

it was my turn.

i was going to coddle him now. i was going to nurture his swollen softball bumps. i was going to pick him up and help him to the car and baby him while he sniffled and reeled.

i was going to be the hero for once.. keyword being ""was.""

i lept out of the car. ""i can be your hero baby"" played in my head like elevator music. i felt my cape flowing figuratively behind my back.

suddenly i was on the ground, my knee twisted at an 80 degree angle. my hip felt the twist and it hurt so bad, i thought i broke it. unlike him, i did not fall gracefully. i hit the ground with such a thud that the lady in the car next to us got out ready to help me.

i laid there on the ground, air knocked out of me. enrique iglesias' ""hero"" stopped abruptly and instead sirens were blaring in my head. i instinctively wriggled my feet to see which one was going to get too thicc for socks.

everything seemed fine until i went to get up. nope. my knee was kaput, and i let out a gasp in surprise.

of course my boyfriend was up, not even bruised or limping, ready to swipe me up and buckle me into the car.

my boyfriend and this sweet lady was trying to help me up, but i elected to chubby lady crawl by the car so i could get up myself. i had them open the door and i crawled in, thanking the lady and buckling myself in.

as i sniffled and licked my wounds, he told me he was grateful that my first reaction was to try to help him. we laughed and joked about how funny it was. it was like a cartoon skit, i was peter griffin falling down and holding my knee, hissing between my teeth. one moment i was coming around the car the next i was on the ground with a shocked look on my face. i am still giggling about it.

he went to the store to get us some treats since we didn't want to end the night on a bad note, and once he disappeared into the store i just bawled and screamed. i think if anyone heard me they would think i was possessed.

i just wanted to be there for him for once, i felt so useless that even when he fell i couldn't help him. instead once again i was the victim of a sprain, only i wish it was my ankle. this time it is my knee, and i would rather sprain my ankle twice again. 

i composed myself by the time he got back to the car with skittles.

today i am confined to the bed, wishing we had our uber card already so we could get some crutches and gooey pizza. now i am browsing reddit until my phone dies then napping while it charges.

he on the other hand, doesn't even have a bruise to show for it.

boyfriend: 8
me: 0

tl;dr: i fall down a lot, my boyfriend never falls. he finally fell for the first time in 4 years, and when i went to help him. i fell down too and ended up spraining my knee.

"by joining my girlfriend's sister in the shower. long story short, my girlfriend (18) is getting her license next week so i have to pick her up to go to my house and drop her back off at her place (40 min round trip).

last night i dropped her off at midnight and she wanted me to stay since i had work at 6am and my workplace is down the street from her house.

my girlfriend and i regularly shower together at her house. she woke up and told me she was going to take a shower, and left the room, thinking i was going to sleep a little longer. to surprise her, i slyly walked into the bathroom and stripped naked. she was humming in the shower and i thought it'd be funny to scare her, so i opened the shower curtain, penor hanging loose, and yelled ""surprise!!!"" to my shock, it was her sister, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. i stood there for a second trying to process what was going on and just yelled sorry and ran out butt naked.

my girlfriend was in the kitchen and thought it was hilarious when i explained, but her sister and i haven't made eye contact since and haven't said a word to each other. fml.

tl;dr - walked in on my girlfriend's sister naked in the shower thinking it was my girlfriend.

edit: she's 18 as well.

edit 2: a lot of people have posted questions so i'll answer them here. her dad isn't really involved in her life and doesn't care what she does. she's turning 19 next month and her sister recently turned 18. her mom is really chill about us showering and having sex, they even talk about our sex life together which is pretty weird but my girlfriend is really close to her and her mom loves me. her mom is catholic but not very strict about her religious views and doesn't force her religion upon her kids.",4

it is with great regret and sorrow that i'm writing you.

i had to elope with my new girlfriend, because i wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you.

i've been finding real passion with stacy.

she is so nice, but i knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than i am.

but it's not only the passion, dad.

she's pregnant.

stacy said that we will be very happy.

she owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

we share a dream of having many more children.

stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

we'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

in the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for aids so that stacy can get better.

she sure deserves it!

don't worry dad, i'm 15, and i know how to take care of myself.

someday, i'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

love, your son, joshua.

p.s. dad, none of the above is true.

"i(f30) divorced my ex husband (m36) because of my mil(f60s) and suddenly he wants back in. i will be rambling a little as i am very mad right now. sorry for my bad english. it is not my first language

my ex and i were married for well over 5 years and together for 10 . his mother was a nightmare. she would spent her time belitteling me and tried humiliating me. i could take it as i loved my husband and didn't want to make him choose between her or me.

of course i would always tell him what she would be doing and he would always brush it off as her being ""a loving and over protecting mom ""

when she would say something racist ( i am hispanic and they are white) he would laugh it off, when she would make a comment of me being a gold digger ( even tho i earned more than my ex) he would just say ""oh mom "" . he would also get mad at me if i ever stood up for myself.

but the straw that broke the camels back is when we had our daughter. my mil would always try to parent her and say that i would do something wrong .

my daughter has an irritable colon and she can not ingest any kind of fucking oils or artificial things. and guess what that looney of a woman did??

she fed my 3 year old daughter essential oils( she is not anti vaxx , just very stupid)  to make her go to sleep . she was in the icu. i had it and i confronted my husband who said "" she only did what she thought was best "".

i lost it . i went to my parents and drafted a divorce agreement . ( thats the best course of action. i saw a post earlier describing a situation that is much more dangerous than mine involving allergens and an epipen. )

his face was like that pikachu meme when i served him . he didn't know why i was doing that because we were ""happy"".

so now a year has passed and my life was hell.  my monster in law tried every dirty trick in the book to take my daugther . to name a few :

* she accused my brother of molesting her
* she accused me of neglect
* she accused me of taking drugs and leaving them in reach of a toddler ( i take thyroxin for heavens sake !)
* she accused me of endangering my daughter by leaving random man in my house
* the list goes on

during this time the excuse of my ex was that i *broke his heart and i had to undertstand his mother. she only wants whats best for him.*

luckily i got good representation and even got my daughter full time  minus some weekends or visitation . i could prove that my daughter was endangered by his mother.

so now to the advice part.

i knew that my ex needed to be permanently in my life because of my daughter. and i was learning to live with that . he was very cold with me because again.. i broke his heart .

now 2 things have come together :

* my ex bil got married to an african american woman, so ofcourse my ex mil flipped
* i started dating again

my bil is a great guy and he actually stood up for his wife ( !!! go figure it is possible). i stay in contact with him because we are friends and hewas a mediator and fought with his brother quite often .so my bil actually stood up for his wife and my ex husband got his panties in a twist, my bil basically opened his eyes how shitty he was being. and that their mom treated me the same way she treated his wife. and finally my dense ex started understanding.

they guy i am seeing is great . i have even met his parents and his mother is normal . she treats me like a human being and has invited me allready to many family functions and tries to make me and my daughter feel welcomed . my ex got wind from the situation trough a mutual friend and guess who is now flipping his shit?

he started bringing flowers and chocolate ( i don't even like chocolate!!!) to pick up our daugther. he sends me cards and sms with hearts and who knows what .

yesterday was the ""best thing"". my daughter was at my mothers place and i was at home with my boyfriend. he appears infront of my door crying and clutching my engagement ring begging me to come back.

i said no and that he should go away. he wouldn't and started demanding that i come out to talk to him. my boyfriend told him that he would call the police ,and in his pathetic fashion  he threatened to beat my boyfriend up.

i closed the door and let him pound sand .

today he picked up my daughter for a day trip and when they came back my daughter was asking if i loved my boyfriend more than her .

now i am at a loss to what to do. i allready told my daughter that it was imposible because my love for her is infinite and there is nothing bigger than infinite.

but now i know that my ex is trying to make my daughter hate me .i am at a loss because i won't use my daughter as amunition. but also....what the hell am i supposed to do??i will never return with that man but i can't take the father of my daughter. do you guys have any advice?


edit /mini update : thanks you all! i needed to vent and was feeling helpless and am so thankfull for you wonderful people.

i talked to my lawyer who confirmed that we could have a case for domestic violence by proxy. a social worker will be visiting us in the next few days to talk to my daughter about this.


edit : because apparently people want to spin the world narrative on me.
i don't care if he wants me back i don't love him anymore and will never get back together with him
staying for the sake of our daughter would not make sense as it has been proven that the kids grow up happier and divorced homes than unhappy homes.

i tried talking to my husband when we were still married and he would always brush it off. he would brush off everything his mother did. i complained to him and told him we needed go to therapy wich he declined.

he has his daughter on the weekends. the court gave ne majority custody because of his mother.

"general advice for anyone trying to decide whether to stay in or go back to a relationship. if you are wondering whether you should stay in a relationship or go back to your ex, i have a mental exercise for you.

&#x200b;

close your eyes and imagine you are holding a puppy- any breed you like. feel it's warm weight against your chest, it's soft sweet breath on your neck. stroke the puppy's soft fur, feel the fineness of its skin and the delicate bones beneath, touch it's tiny paws, smooth and soft against your skin, kiss its little domed skull and look into its gentle, trusting eyes.

&#x200b;

are you holding your puppy? do you feel its softness, it's warmth, its vulnerability- that soft little mouth, peach like nose and all those fragile little bones? do you feel its weight in your arms, snuggling up against your heart- trusting and relying on you.

&#x200b;

ok, now give that puppy to your partner/ ex.

&#x200b;

if the breath stills in your lungs, if your heart clenches, if you hesitate, then you need to ask yourself why.

&#x200b;

is it because they are a bully- who would shout at and hit the puppy, bruising that thin skin and breaking those fragile bones? is it because you know that they'd neglect the puppy, leaving it alone, possibly hungry and cold and ignoring its cries for attention and affection. is it because they are contradictory- a person who is nice whilst the world is going their way but who will turn on you for breathing if something goes wrong in their life?

and, if you'd hesitate over giving that puppy to your partner, why the hell are you giving yourself to them?! aren't you worth as much as an imaginary dog?

&#x200b;

too often, in life, we seriously undervalue ourselves and excuse away behaviours which we'd find inexcusable if another person was subjected to them. however, we are just as vulnerable and breakable as the next person- and just as valuable.

&#x200b;

so, don't put up with behaviours which you wouldn't wish on a dog. if someone abused a puppy, you'd take that puppy out of the situation- do the same for yourself. if someone ignored their puppy, spending all of their time with other people/ doing other things, you'd know that the puppy was not getting the physical, mental and emotional stimulation it needed and you'd find someone who had time for the puppy- again, do the same for yourself. if someone abandoned a puppy, leaving it crying, you wouldn't chase after the person to give the puppy back to them... you're getting the drift?

&#x200b;

value yourself. and, if it helps, think of your soul as that puppy you imagined. look into its trusting eyes- its relying on you to find someone kind, someone patient, someone with love and time to give. you are responsible for your own health and happiness and that loving, caring person might be sitting there lonely, waiting for someone just like you to come into their life.

&#x200b;

\_\_\_\_\_edit\_\_\_\_\_

  
someone asked ""what if you know you mistreat the puppy yourself too?""

the answer is simple: take a long, hard look at how you treat the people in your life and work out how you can change your behaviour so that you can treat 'the puppy' (e.g. friends/family/your s.o) well.

we're all 'bad' people to some extent; all greedy, lazy, selfish, hypocritical, temperamental, judgemental, cowardly and even cruel. however, what you are isn't the end of the story. a 'good' person is someone who looks at their options, second by second, and always tries to chooses to take the better path; it's not the only path or the easiest path but they choose the right path because they have self-respect.

these 'choices' can happen at the deepest of levels; whatever people say, we can actually control our thoughts and our feelings if we put in the effort: for example, you might look at someone and think 'ugly' but, if you're trying to be a better person, you'll then think to yourself 'no, stop that. it's unkind and shallow'. or you might see someone with something you want and feel a stab of jealousy, then think 'why am i jealous, i've got my friends, my family, etc and that's more important than x'. choices- every moment of every day- and if you try to think only kind, rational thoughts and feel only kind, positive feelings, then you'll find it easier and easier to do the right thing.

\_\_\_\_edit 2\_\_\_\_

&#x200b;

i've written an additional edit because certain questions/comments seem to reoccur and, as there have been so many comments, my original answers to substantially similar questions/comments are now a couple of pages back and i know repeating/copy-pasting annoys people.

&#x200b;

edit 2a:

if you are allergic to or don't like dogs, you can also visualise another type of animal or a human baby if that is more relevant to you.

&#x200b;

edit 2b:

a number of people have been making comments along the lines of 'my ex/s.o. is great with animals/loves dogs but treats/treated me badly"" or ""is a vile person""

if your ex/s.o would treat/treats their dog better than they treat you:

a. make a list, one with the differences between their behaviour to you and their behaviour towards the dog;

b. do the visualisation again, but imagine that they'd treat the puppy just like they treated you.

&#x200b;

you wouldn't leave an abused/neglected dog with someone just because they were kind to their other pet and, more importantly...

&#x200b;

\*\*\*you are more important than an imaginary dog!\*\*\*

&#x200b;

edit 2c:

emotional distress. some abusive behaviours, e.g. adultery, won't affect a dog like they do a human partner. however, the important point is that pain and distress caused. if a person does something knowing it will cause severe hurt, then use a comparative physical hurt in your visualisation.

&#x200b;

edit 2d.

finally, people have also commented that this doesn't apply to situations where people are just incompatible. no, it doesn't; it was designed to help people with high levels of empathy to realise that they need to protect themselves as much as they'd protect an animal.

&#x200b;

however, that said, anyone who has ever bought a dog from a reputable breeder will know that great humans will not be allowed to buy a great dog if they are fundamentally incompatible. if you want a collie and your favourite past-time is sitting on your backside, no reputable breeder will let you walk away with a pup because, although you might be the nicest, kindest person in the world, you will be driven up the wall by an energetic dog who will be literally running up the walls if they don't spend hours hiking around the countryside.

where there's incompatibility, it often leads to both parties making compromises for the duration of their relationship. people rarely change in fundamentals and you need to ask yourself; 1. what compromise/s do we need to make to meet each other half way? 2. am i willing/able to make my compromises? 3. is my s.o. also willing/able to make their compromises? 4. will we both be able to live, long term, in the compromise situation? if the answer to any of these questions is no, you are going to get frustrated with each other, the frustration will probably turn into irritation and the irritation will probably turn into recrimination because we all, secretly think 'if they love me, they will change' without asking ourselves 'if i love them, why don't i change?'

so, if you are a collie and your s.o is a couch potato, then you'll either have to accept that you'll get 50% of the exercise you need and they will have to do 50% more than they want or you go and do your exercise whilst they play video-games and you meet up for meals. or you break up and make sure that, in the future, you automatically rule out anyone who is not in running gear!",7

"update: i've (21/m) been dating a girl (20/f) for two months now but i haven't told her that i have a micropenis. link to original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bilxyp/ive_21m_been_dating_a_girl_20f_for_two_months_now

after reading tons of replies in the thread and all of the positive stories about girls who dated guys with thumb dicks, i was able to tell her about my peewee issue without feeling very embarrassed. i opted for a playful serious way to talk about it with her, so i told her that i had a micropenis and that i was serious. she asked me how big it was and i said that it was in the 2 inch region, give or take a bit. she said that she didn't expect it to be so small and that she wished i told her sooner, but she said that it's okay as long as i make it up to her in other ways. ;)

we decided that since i'm gonna have to make up for my lack of a fun-rod, we'll just buy toys that i can use on her and give each other the good ol mouth treatment. after she took it well, i jokingly told her that since my penis is around the size of one of her thumbs, we should have a thumb war and that instead of my thumb, i can use my penis in battle. she took it well and we both laughed about the joke and continued on with our day.

anyways, i can successfully say that we did it reddit! thank you all for your stories and advice, it really helped me out a lot. looks like we're in it for the long run without any issues.",7

"for asking to be charged for a man's haircut when i am a woman. i am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years i have had a short, men's style haircut. i'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. my sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. it usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. during that time every salon i've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. this has always annoyed me and i don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

recently i moved and yesterday i went to a new shop for my monthly trim and i decided to try something new. i asked if i could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. the woman at the counter looked like i slapped her. she called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. they talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. i pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and i ended up leaving. i was never rude or mean, but i still feel bad that i wasted a stylist's appointment.

for asking? leaving? being annoyed at what i see as a double standard?

"is amway just another pyramid scheme? my friend recently got excited over it and wants me in it. hi,  
i have a friend that i met at uni and we're very close (met him on my first day which was last year this time).   just yesterday he was approached through a networking website and attended a meeting for a company named ""amway"".   i did a bit of research and what i've gathered, it's another pyramid scheme.   but how? aren't they illegal?   he literally spilt out everything they said in the meeting about ""investing in products, marketing it and gaining huge profits eventually"", and seemed genuinely excited. he then wants to bring me in as a mentee, because he thinks i'll really like it.   i don't believe he would try to bring me in, if he knew it was something along the lines of a pyramid scheme, (since we're close mates and all).   so what does reddit think of amway?   is it an obvious choice to run?  
edit: thanks for the answers everyone!   unfortunately, we had a long debate today about it and he is definitely set. even after i talked about the pyramid scheme esque facts and everything else you guys said. i'm still going to be his friend but i'm definitely not bought. he is very stubborn and wants me to read a book by kiyosaki... he also mentioned that they sell products at a price lower than retail price, contrary to what other posters said. can anyone confirm?  
mind you guys, i am definitely not going to consider joining amway. i might be beating a dead horse but i'm going to still continue to convince my friend to run.

"tifu. i, a hijabi told my teacher to burn the bible. before you go all pork on me, i'll give you some insight. in islam you discard anything with god's name on it by burning it. yesterday in statistics, our teacher found a bible that was left in our class. no one knew who it belonged to and our teacher said, ""you can't throw it in the trash right?, there's a thing against that.?"" and i, the only hijabi in my grade said ""i think you're supposed to burn it"" the whole class turned and looked at me like i wanted to kill them. i just checked and one of the proper methods of disposing a bible is by cremating it so i was right. i posted it in r/izlam, and someone commented ""yeah, in germany we have bad memories about burning books, but we were mostly nazis back then burning anything that is against fascist doctrine"" maybe the reactions were because i live in a primarily jewish town, or because christians are unaware of how holy scriptures are to be recycled.
tl;dr: my teacher asked how you dispose of a bible and i said to burn it because that's the proper method but looked savage

"paid off 48k in student debt in one year, just made last payment.. hi everyone,

long time lurker and was 48k in student debt last december. made a commitment last year to get out of debt. first, off i went the opposite direction and took a $3,500 digital marketing course. that allowed me though to land a higher paying job as a marketing manager for a professional services firm. 

i already had an emergency fund of 5k and my new job didn't let us get in the 401k plan until a year in (since has been changed). i put everything i made into my loans, besides rent & utility, cheap food and didn't buy anything like new clothes or luxury items. i then got a gig doing private security at events like pax east, comic con, apple and at hospitals that paid any where from $20-30hr. would do these sporadically for anywhere from 10-40 extra hrs a week and huck it am my loans. i also signed up for rover.com and took care of about 40 different types of dogs. 

the final push is when i started driving uber. i work in boston right next to a college so after work it would often be surging and i'd drive for hours after work. i got addicted and would try to bring in an extra $500-800 week driving. lots of caffeine and not going out on weekends. kept track of mileage, driving expenses and expected taxes. i also made and extra $1600 referring four drivers

i was making quick headway, but was getting really burnt out. i would occasionally take a weekend off to recharge and then get back at it i would fantasize about hitting a scratch ticket for the last 10k or a gift from a long lost relative. then fate intervened. at my old job we had a pension program i never paid attention to because they said it was going away. well one day i get a call from my  old cfo the plan was frozen and i was being paid out a little over 10k. i could either take it as cash and pay 3k in taxes & fines, or roll it over. i was extremely tempted to take it and run, but after talking to my cpa coworkers, decided to suck it up and roll it over into an ira at wealthfront. 

i drove a shit ton of uber the last two months, put my whole work bonus and all my rover funds towards the last 10k. i was down to 3k last night and used 3gs from my emergency fund to finish it off. it was a very long process, but i'm glad i'm done. now have to replenish the emergency fund and save up for taxes (saved a bunch, but got greedy towards the end putting it all at the loan). 

i'm done and am looking forward to having more free time for fun, learning more skills to get a better job and getting back into fitness. i also made my first post loans splurge purchase..new retro jordan 9's..don't know why i wanted them, but i did. 😎

"by telling the grocery store they needed to get rid of their new, loud, automated door greeter.. this happened last week. i was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. i pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and i hear in an automated, loud, voice, ""thank you for shopping at safeway!""  
slightly startled by the unexpected greeting, i continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. multiple times i hear, ""welcome to safeway!"" and ""thank you for choosing your local safeway."" and i think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.  
  
  after i pickup my script, i grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the u-scan to check out and i am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. after i finish at u-scan and turn to leave i see a manager speaking to the u-scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, ""you guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. that thing is soooooo annoying!""    
the manager looks at me like i'm a fucking monster and says, ""there is no way we are getting rid of sarah! she isn't going anywhere!""       
  
confused and surprised i bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she's crazy and go to leave, running the confusion through my head, looking down as i walk. then i go to exit and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and i look up. turns out the robo-greeter sarah is a human woman named sarah with als or some kind of similar hawking-esque catastrophic disability. she was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messages for customers as they enter and exit.   my stomach immediately sank and my face turned red as i walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...

tl;dr i told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman.   
  
edit - just to clarify, i think this is hysterical now. i find great hilarity at my own blunder, which is why i decided to share. i'm not going to a different store. i have no shame in going back there at all.

"for not agreeing that i (m23) was raised by a single mom?. my parents got divorced when i was 6 years old and they had equal 50-50 custody of me and my older sister until each of us turned 18. my dad has remarried pretty quickly and my mom has a few boyfriends who came and went over the years, nothing too crazy and was single most of the time.

what made me mad was that from time to time my mom (f59) makes comments about how she raised my sister and i as a single parent. i disagree and tell her that she raised us half of the time while the other half we were raised by our dad (m58). she then says that he didn't do much and that we were raised by a single mom who did everything for us.

"by playing a jackbox game with my girlfriend's family. a little background: my girlfriend's family is extremely conservative. like goes-to-church-twice-every-sunday-and-never-swears conservative. while they are really nice people, it's a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. onward...

so earlier tonight, my girlfriend's family decided to play some games together. we settled on drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). this is where things go south... 

after choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. seems cool, right? however, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, you can't erase. so being the funny guy i am, i draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. we have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. as a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit ""submit,"" on my phone. in reality, she really did hit submit. next thing i know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. there was no mistaking this beauty, either. i feel my heart skip a beat. i looked around and accidentally make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything i've experience before.

i panic. i try to exit out of the game, but my dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. i stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. i try to pretend that i have no idea what happened. 

the game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. i don't say a single word. the room is uncomfortably silent. i hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and i'm doing my best not to explode inside.

the game finally ends after what feels like a year. i select the new character screen and her dad says, ""what? you don't want to keep your big penis on there? jesus would be so proud on this easter weekend.""

safe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn't the one for me. 

tl;dr: i played jackbox's drawful with my girlfriend's family. i joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. so there i was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend's sheltered, conservative family...

"by introducing my pitbull to my kitten. so, a little bit of backstory: 

my mom used to work in a barn caring for horses. one day somebody came with a dog. it was emaciated looking, and had scars on its face. my mom felt bad for it and brought it home. we found that it was abused as a puppy and abandoned. it's now five years later and she's healthy and resilient. she's scared of anybody raising objects around her or making loud noises due to her past, but she's protective of her family and a lovely dog for the house. she's been a bit overprotective recently, growling at passersby on walks, and it's something we're working on. being that she's a muscular, intimidating looking dog, people tend to stay away anyway. other than that, she's a perfect pitbull.

we also just adopted a kitten (8 weeks old) and it's the tiniest, most adorable animal i've ever owned. after around a week we decided to introduce the dog to the kitten, with strict supervision. we brought them both into the kitchen and put them on the ground. surprisingly, they sniffed each other and walked away with little interest. oh, whatever. 

so me and my gf have to run to walmart so we leave the two of them together, knowing they weren't really interested in one another. we leave for around half an hour, and are shocked when we walk in.

our pitbull is in the corner of the living room, shaking, with her eyes open wide as the kitten pounces and chases after her tail. she's yipping at the baby kitten that weighs less than a pound. we separate them into different rooms while in tears laughing and make a note not to let them in the same room together for a while.

tldr: left pitbull with tiny kitten, pitbull ends up cowering in the corner while kitten plays with her tail.


edit: all those saying this was irresponsible, i'm going to add that they had met a few times previously and we made sure that the pitbull didn't display aggressive behaviours toward the kitten. i am qualified with animal behaviour, and all safety was ensured. my mother was also at my house at the time.
